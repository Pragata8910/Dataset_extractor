39920223,Drosophila ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 stabilizes the PERIOD protein by regulating a ubiquitin ligase SLIMB.,"The circadian clock orchestrates behavior and physiology through the oscillation of key clock proteins like PERIOD (PER). Here, we investigate the role of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14) in modulating PER stability and circadian rhythms in Drosophila. We find that overexpression of USP14 in clock cells reduces PER protein levels without altering its mRNA levels whereas USP14 knockdown increases PER protein levels, suggesting that USP14 regulates PER post-translationally. Interestingly, despite these alterations in PER levels, neither USP14 overexpression nor knockdown significantly impacts circadian behavioral rhythms, likely because of slight effects on PER levels in small ventral lateral neurons (sLN(v)s). Further analysis shows that USP14 physically interacts with Supernumerary Limbs (SLIMB), a protein involved in PER degradation. Moreover, reducing slimb expression mitigates the effects of USP14 on PER protein stability. Mass spectrometry identifies two ubiquitination sites on PER (Lys1117 and Lys1118) critical for its degradation. Expression of PER(1117A, 1118A) mutant in per(01) background impairs circadian rhythm strength. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Drosophila USP14 indirectly modulates PER protein stability by affecting SLIMB and highlights the critical role of specific ubiquitination sites on PER in maintaining circadian rhythms.",Communications biology,2025 Feb 7,10.1038/s42003-025-07632-9 [pii],
39675091,USP14 inhibition by degrasyn induces YAP1 degradation and suppresses the progression of radioresistant esophageal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is a major modality for esophageal cancer (ESCA) treatment, yet radioresistance severely hampers its therapeutic efficacy. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14) is a novel deubiquitinase and can mediate cancer cells' response to irradiation, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, including in ESCA. METHODS: To evaluate the expression of USP14 in ESCA tissues or cells, we used RNA-Seq, immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), ubiquitination, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunofluorescence assays in this investigation. Additionally, we used CCK8, cloning, and migration tests to examine the proliferation and migration of ESCA cells. We also used transplantation tumor mouse model to investigate the course of the cancer cell growth. Finally, we looked into the biological processes linked to USP14 using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which was later verified. RESULTS: We observed a significant upregulation of USP14 in human ESCA tissues and cell lines, especially in those with radioresistance. Moreover, USP14 knockdown significantly restrained the proliferation and inhibited the radiation tolerance of ESCC cells. Here, we identified a potential inhibitor of USP14, Degrasyn (DGS), and investigated its regulatory effects on ESCA radioresistance and progression. We found that DGS had marked antiproliferative effects in radiosensitive ESCA cell lines. Notably, a low dose of DGS significantly enhanced the sensitivity of radioresistant ESCA cells to irradiation, as shown by the significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the combination of DGS and X-ray irradiation strongly induced DNA damage in radioresistant ESCA cell lines by increasing the phosphorylation levels of H2AX (gamma-H2AX) and checkpoint kinase 1/ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated-and-Rad3-related kinase (CHK1/ATR) signaling. Animal experiments confirmed the effective role of the DGS and X-ray combined treatment in reducing tumor growth and irradiation tolerance of ESCA in vivo with undetectable toxicity. Importantly, the promotive and malignant biological behaviors of ESCA cells suppressed by the DGS/X-ray combination treatment were almost eliminated by USP14 overexpression, along with the abolished DNA damage process. Mechanistically, we found that USP14 could interact with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and induce its deubiquitination in radioresistant ESCA cells. Interestingly, we discovered that DGS/X-ray co-therapy significantly reduced the stability of YAP1 and induced its ubiquitination in radioresistant ESCA cells. More importantly, the proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal tansition (EMT) process, and DNA damage regulated by DGS/X-ray and USP14 knockdown were significantly eliminated when YAP1 was overexpressed in radioresistant ESCA cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data revealed the potential role of DGS/X-ray co-therapy in controlling ESCA resistance to radiotherapy by inhibiting the USP14/YAP1 axis, providing a candidate strategy for ESCA treatment.","Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2025 Feb,S1476-5586(24)00142-8 [pii],
39486496,USP14 inhibition enhances Parkin-independent mitophagy in iNeurons.,"Loss of proteostasis is well documented during physiological aging and depends on the progressive decline in the activity of two major degradative mechanisms: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This decline in proteostasis is exacerbated in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In PD, patients develop an accumulation of aggregated proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria, which leads to ROS production, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We recently reported that inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, which is known to enhance both the UPS and autophagy, increases lifespan and rescues the pathological phenotype of two Drosophila models of PD. Studies on the effects of USP14 inhibition in mammalian neurons have not yet been conducted. To close this gap, we exploited iNeurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and investigated the effect of inhibiting USP14 in these cultured neurons. Quantitative global proteomics analysis performed following genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP14 demonstrated that USP14 loss of function specifically promotes mitochondrial autophagy in iNeurons. Biochemical and imaging data also showed that USP14 inhibition enhances mitophagy. The mitophagic effect of USP14 inhibition proved to be PINK1/Parkin- independent, instead relying on expression of the mitochondrial E3 Ubiquitin Ligase MITOL/MARCH5. Notably, USP14 inhibition normalized the mitochondrial defects of Parkin KO human neurons.",Pharmacological research,2024 Dec,S1043-6618(24)00429-8 [pii],
38844605,Loss of the proteasomal deubiquitinase USP14 induces growth defects and a senescence phenotype in colorectal cancer cells.,"The proteasome-associated deubiquitinase USP14 is a potential drug target. Using an inducible USP14 knockout system in colon cancer cells, we found that USP14 depletion impedes cellular proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and leads to a senescence-like phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered gene expression related to cell division and cellular differentiation. USP14 knockout cells also exhibited changes in morphology, actin distribution, and expression of actin cytoskeletal components. Increased ubiquitin turnover was observed, offset by upregulation of polyubiquitin genes UBB and UBC. Pharmacological inhibition of USP14 with IU1 increased ubiquitin turnover but did not affect cellular growth or morphology. BioGRID data identified USP14 interactors linked to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, DNA damage repair, mRNA splicing, and translation. In conclusion, USP14 loss in colon cancer cells induces a transient quiescent cancer phenotype not replicated by pharmacologic inhibition of its deubiquitinating activity.",Scientific reports,2024 Jun 6,10.1038/s41598-024-63791-5 [pii],
38636737,USP14 negatively regulates IFN signaling by dampening K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 in black carp.,"USP14 regulates the immune related pathways by deubiquitinating the signaling molecules in mammals. In teleost, USP14 is also reported to inhibit the antiviral immune response through TBK1, but its regulatory mechanism remains obscure. To elucidate the role of USP14 in the RLR/IFN antiviral pathway in teleost, the homolog USP14 (bcUSP14) of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterize in this paper. bcUSP14 contains 490 amino acids (aa), and the sequence is well conserved among in vertebrates. Over-expression of bcUSP14 in EPC cells attenuated SVCV-induced transcription activity of IFN promoters and enhanced SVCV replication. Knockdown of bcUSP14 in MPK cells led to the increased transcription of IFNs and decreased SVCV replication, suggesting the improved antiviral activity of the host cells. The interaction between bcUSP14 and bcTBK1 was identified by both co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Co-expressed bcUSP14 obviously inhibited bcTBK1-induced IFN production and antiviral activity in EPC cells. K63-linked polyubiquitination of bcTBK1 was dampened by co-expressed bcUSP14, and bcTBK1-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were also inhibited by this deubiquitinase. Thus, all the data demonstrated that USP14 interacts with and inhibits TBK1 through deubiquitinating TBK1 in black carp.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024 Jun,S1050-4648(24)00203-1 [pii],
38247539,PKCiota Inhibits the Ferroptosis of Esophageal Cancer Cells via Suppressing USP14-Mediated Autophagic Degradation of GPX4.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most frequent malignant tumors, and the mechanisms underlying the anti-ferroptosis of esophageal cancer cells are still largely unclear. This study aims to explore the roles of amplified protein kinase C iota (PKCiota) in the ferroptosis of ESCC cells. Cell viability, colony formation, MDA assay, Western blotting, co-IP, PLA, and RNA-seq technologies are used to reveal the roles and mechanisms underlying the PKCiota-induced resistance of ESCC cells to ferroptosis. We showed here that PKCiota was amplified and overexpressed in ESCC and decreased during RSL3-induced ferroptosis of ESCC cells. PKCiota interacted with GPX4 and the deubiquitinase USP14 and improved the protein stability of GPX4 by suppressing the USP14-mediated autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. PKCiota was negatively regulated by miR-145-5p, which decreased in esophageal cancer, and also regulated by USP14 and GPX4 by a positive feedback loop. PKCiota silencing and miR-145-5p overexpression suppressed tumor growth of ESCC cells in vivo, respectively; even a combination of silencing PKCiota and RSL3 treatment showed more vital suppressive roles on tumor growth than silencing PKCiota alone. Both PKCiota silencing and miR-145-5p overexpression sensitized ESCC cells to RSL3-induced ferroptosis. These results unveiled that amplified and overexpressed PKCiota induced the resistance of ESCC cells to ferroptosis by suppressing the USP14-mediated autophagic degradation of GPX4. Patients with PKCiota/USP14/GPX4 pathway activation might be sensitive to GPX4-targeted ferroptosis-based therapy.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2024 Jan 17,antiox13010114 [pii],
37229827,USP14 regulates heme metabolism and ovarian cancer invasion through BACH1 deubiquitination and stabilization.,"The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 has been established as a crucial regulator in various diseases, including tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic diseases, through its ability to stabilize its substrate proteins. Our group has utilized proteomic techniques to identify new potential substrate proteins for USP14, however, the underlying signaling pathways regulated by USP14 remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the key role of USP14 in both heme metabolism and tumor invasion by stabilizing the protein BACH1. The cellular oxidative stress response factor NRF2 regulates antioxidant protein expression through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). BACH1 can compete with NRF2 for ARE binding, leading to the inhibition of the expression of antioxidant genes, including HMOX-1. Activated NRF2 also inhibits the degradation of BACH1, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our findings showed a positive correlation between USP14 expression and NRF2 expression in various cancer tissues from the TCGA database and normal tissues from the GTEx database. Furthermore, activated NRF2 was found to increase USP14 expression in ovarian cancer (OV) cells. The overexpression of USP14 was observed to inhibit HMOX1 expression, while USP14 knockdown had the opposite effect, suggesting a role for USP14 in regulating heme metabolism. The depletion of BACH1 or inhibition of heme oxygenase 1 (coded by HMOX-1) was also found to significantly impair USP14-dependent OV cell invasion. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of the NRF2-USP14-BACH1 axis in regulating OV cell invasion and heme metabolism, providing evidence for its potential as a therapeutic target in related diseases.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2023 Jul 30,S0006-291X(23)00505-3 [pii],
35530310,Comprehensive Target Screening and Cellular Profiling of the Cancer-Active Compound b-AP15 Indicate Abrogation of Protein Homeostasis and Organelle Dysfunction as the Primary Mechanism of Action.,"Dienone compounds have been demonstrated to display tumor-selective anti-cancer activity independently of the mutational status of TP53. Previous studies have shown that cell death elicited by this class of compounds is associated with inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here we extend previous findings by showing that the dienone compound b-AP15 inhibits proteasomal degradation of long-lived proteins. We show that exposure to b-AP15 results in increased association of the chaperones VCP/p97/Cdc48 and BAG6 with proteasomes. Comparisons between the gene expression profile generated by b-AP15 to those elicited by siRNA showed that knock-down of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinase (DUB) USP14 is the closest related to drug response. USP14 is a validated target for b-AP15 and we show that b-AP15 binds covalently to two cysteines, Cys203 and Cys257, in the ubiquitin-binding pocket of the enzyme. Consistent with this, deletion of USP14 resulted in decreased sensitivity to b-AP15. Targeting of USP14 was, however, found to not fully account for the observed proteasome inhibition. In search for additional targets, we utilized genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening and Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) to identify mechanistically essential genes and b-AP15 interacting proteins respectively. Deletion of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins decreased the sensitivity to b-AP15, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is coupled to cell death induced by b-AP15. Enzymes known to be involved in Phase II detoxification such as aldo-ketoreductases and glutathione-S-transferases were identified as b-AP15-targets using PISA. The finding that different exploratory approaches yielded different results may be explained in terms of a ""target"" not necessarily connected to the ""mechanism of action"" thus highlighting the importance of a holistic approach in the identification of drug targets. We conclude that b-AP15, and likely also other dienone compounds of the same class, affect protein degradation and proteasome function at more than one level.",Frontiers in oncology,2022,10.3389/fonc.2022.852980,
35489684,A ubiquitinome analysis to study the functional roles of the proteasome associated deubiquitinating enzymes USP14 and UCH37.,"The removal of (poly)ubiquitin chains at the proteasome is a key step in the protein degradation pathway that determines which proteins are degraded and ultimately decides cell fate. Three different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are associated to the human proteasome, PSMD14 (RPN11), USP14 and UCH37 (UCHL5). However, the functional roles and specificities of these proteasomal DUBs remain elusive. To reveal the specificities of proteasome associated DUBs, we used SILAC based quantitative ubiquitinomics to study the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 based knockout of each of these DUBs on the dynamic cellular ubiquitinome. We observed distinct effects on the global ubiquitinome upon removal of either USP14 or UCH37, while the simultaneous removal of both DUBs suggested less functional redundancy than previously anticipated. We also investigated whether the small molecule inhibitor b-AP15 has the potential to specifically target USP14 and UCH37 by comparing treatment of wild-type versus USP14/UCH37 double-knockout cells with this drug. Strikingly, broad and severe off-target effects were observed, questioning the alleged specificity of this inhibitor. In conclusion, this work presents novel insights into the function of proteasome associated DUBs and illustrates the power of in-depth ubiquitinomics for screening the activity of DUBs and of DUB modulating compounds. SIGNIFICANCE: Introduction: The removal of (poly)ubiquitin chains at the proteasome is a key step in the protein degradation pathway that determines which proteins are degraded and ultimately decides cell fate. Three different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are associated to the human proteasome, PSMD14/RPN11, USP14 and UCH37/UCHL5. However, the functional roles and specificities of these proteasomal DUBs remains elusive. MATERIALS & METHODS: We have applied a SILAC based quantitative ubiquitinomics to study the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 based knockout of each of these DUBs on the dynamic cellular ubiquitinome. Also, we have studied the function of the small molecule inhibitor b-AP15, which has the potential to specifically target USP14 and UCH37. RESULTS: We report distinct effects on the ubiquitinome and the ability of the proteasome to clear proteins upon removal of either USP14 or UCH37, while the simultaneous removal of both DUBs suggests less redundancy than previously anticipated. In addition, broad and severe off-target effects were observed for b-AP15, questioning the alleged specificity of this inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: This work presents novel insights into the function of proteasome associated DUBs and illustrates the power of in-depth ubiquitinomics for screening the activity of DUBs and of DUB modulating compounds.",Journal of proteomics,2022 Jun 30,S1874-3919(22)00116-6 [pii],
35414770,USF1-ATRAP-PBX3 Axis Promote Breast Cancer Glycolysis and Malignant Phenotype by Activating AKT/mTOR Signaling.,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) is widely expressed in different tissues and organs, although its mechanistic role in breast cancer remains unclear. Here, we show that ATRAP is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. Its aberrant upregulation promotes breast cancer aggressiveness and is positively correlated with poor prognosis. Functional assays revealed that ATRAP participates in promoting cell growth, metastasis, and aerobic glycolysis, while microarray analysis showed that ATRAP can activate the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in cancer progression. In addition, ATRAP was revealed to direct Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14)-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of Pre-B cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3). Importantly, ATRAP is a direct target of Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1), and that ATRAP overexpression reverses the inhibitory effects of USF1 knockdown. Our study demonstrates the broad contribution of the USF1/ATRAP/PBX3 axis to breast cancer progression and provides a strong potential therapeutic target.",International journal of biological sciences,2022,ijbsv18p2452 [pii],
33737492,Deubiquitylation and stabilization of Acf7 by ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase 14 (USP14) is critical for NSCLC migration.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is an essential regulator of Acf7, which serves as a key effector for the maintenance of the EMT program and migration. However, the precise mechanism for the deubiquitination of Acf7 is still not fully understood. Using a proteomic approach, we identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14) as an Acf7-associated deubiquitinase. Our findings show that there was an interaction between USP14 and Acf7. The expression of USP14 and Acf7 were elevated in lung cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal cells. Employing the overexpression of USP14 and the USP14 knockdown assay indicated that USP14 can greatly increase the steady-state levels of Acf7 by inhibiting the degradation of Acf7 through the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Here we identified USP14 as a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulated Acf7 ubiquitination and protein levels. Moreover, knockdown of USP14 inhibited cell migration, however, overexpression of wild-type USP14 but not USP14 mutants promoted cell migration. Together, these results suggest that USP14 plays an important role in the NSCLC migration through modulating Acf7 stability.",Journal of biosciences,2021,19 [pii],
30425250,Proteome-wide analysis of USP14 substrates revealed its role in hepatosteatosis via stabilization of FASN.,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) is one of the major proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes critical for proteome homeostasis. However, substrates of USP14 remain largely unknown, hindering the understanding of its functional roles. Here we conduct a comprehensive proteome, ubiquitinome and interactome analysis for USP14 substrate screening. Bioinformatics analysis reveals broad new potential roles of USP14, especially in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Among the potential substrates identified, we show that fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme involved in hepatic lipogenesis, is a bona fide substrate of USP14. USP14 directly interacts with and increases FASN stability. As a result, overexpression of USP14 promotes liver triglyceride accumulation in C57BL/6 mice, whereas genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP14 ameliorates hepatosteatosis, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obese mice. In conclusion, our findings reveal for the first time an indispensable role of USP14 in hepatosteatosis through FASN stabilization.",Nature communications,2018 Nov 13,10.1038/s41467-018-07185-y [pii],
29777785,PSMD2 regulates breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by modulating p21 and p27 proteasomal degradation.,"Alterations in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and UPS-associated proteins have been implicated in the development of many human malignancies. In this study, we investigated the expression profiles of 797 UPS-related genes using HiSeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified that PSMD2 was markedly upregulated in breast cancer. High PSMD2 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that transcriptome signatures involving proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were critically enriched in specimens with elevated PSMD2. Consistently, PSMD2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in vitro, as well as suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Rescue assays demonstrated that the cell cycle arrest caused by silencing PSMD2 partially resulted from increased p21 and/or p27. Mechanically, PSMD2 physically interacted with p21 and p27 and mediated their ubiquitin-proteasome degradation with the cooperation of USP14. Notably, intratumor injection of therapeutic PSMD2 small interfering RNA effectively delayed xenograft tumor growth accompanied by p21 and p27 upregulation. These data provide novel insight into the role of PSMD2 in breast cancer and suggest that PSMD2 may be a potential therapeutic target.",Cancer letters,2018 Aug 28,S0304-3835(18)30343-4 [pii],
29763934,Inactivation of USP14 Perturbs Ubiquitin Homeostasis and Delays the Cell Cycle in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts and in Fruit Fly Drosophila.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The 26S proteasome is the key proteolytic complex for recognition and degradation of polyubiquitinated target substrates in eukaryotes. Among numerous proteasome-associated proteins, a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) USP14 has been identified as an endogenous inhibitor of the proteasome. Here, we explored the complex regulatory functions of USP14 that involve ubiquitin (Ub) homeostasis and substrate degradation in flies and mammals. METHODS: USP14-null primary and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and USP14 knocked-down Drosophila were analyzed in this study. We measured proteasome and DUB activities using fluorogenic reporter substrates and adduct-forming probes. To examine the levels of ubiquitin, we performed immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to examine polyUb chain linkages and USP14-interacing proteins. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, BrdU labeling, and phospho-histone H3 staining. RESULTS: The homeostasis of Ub in USP14-/-MEFs was markedly perturbed because of facilitated clearance of Ub. This phenomenon was recapitulated in muscles of USP14-deficient Drosophila with old ages. Absolute quantitation using MS also revealed that USP14-/- MEFs contained significantly increased amounts of Ub, compared with wild-type. The key phenotype of USP14-/- MEFs was their delayed proliferation originated from prolonged interphase possibly through aberrant degradation of cyclins A and B1. We found that knocking down USP14 in Drosophila resulted in delayed eye development associated with reduced mitotic activity. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies novel cellular functions of USP14 not only in cellular Ub hometostasis but also in cell cycle progression. USP14 was also essential for proper Drosophila eye development. These results strongly suggest that the USP14-mediated proteasome activity regulation may be directly related to various human diseases including cancer.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",2018,000489750 [pii],
29732405,Broad and diverse mechanisms used by deubiquitinase family members in regulating the type I interferon signaling pathway during antiviral responses.,"The innate immune response conferred by type I interferons is essential for host defense against viral infection but needs to be tightly controlled to avoid immunopathology. We performed a systematic functional screening by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) knockout and overexpression to investigate the roles of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family in regulating antiviral immunity. We demonstrated that the expression of a large fraction of DUBs underwent complex temporal alteration, suggesting a dynamic program of feedback regulation. Moreover, we identified previously unrecognized roles of a subset of DUBs, including USP5, USP14, USP22, USP48, USP52, COPS5, and BRCC3, in inhibiting antiviral immunity at various levels. We explored an unexpected mechanism where multiple DUBs, such as USP5 and USP22, form diverse signalosomes with E3 ligases or DUBs to alter the substrates' ubiquitination state instead of directly cleaving the ubiquitin chains on substrates via their protease activity. Altogether, our study has revealed a panoramic view of the broad and dynamic involvement of DUB family proteins in regulating antiviral responses.",Science advances,2018 May,aar2824 [pii],
22792064,Antiviral activity of a small molecule deubiquitinase inhibitor occurs via induction of the unfolded protein response.,"Ubiquitin (Ub) is a vital regulatory component in various cellular processes, including cellular responses to viral infection. As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses have the capacity to manipulate the ubiquitin (Ub) cycle to their advantage by encoding Ub-modifying proteins including deubiquitinases (DUBs). However, how cellular DUBs modulate specific viral infections, such as norovirus, is poorly understood. To examine the role of DUBs during norovirus infection, we used WP1130, a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of cellular DUBs. Replication of murine norovirus in murine macrophages and the human norovirus Norwalk virus in a replicon system were significantly inhibited by WP1130. Chemical proteomics identified the cellular DUB USP14 as a target of WP1130 in murine macrophages, and pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP14 inhibited murine norovirus infection. USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB that also binds to inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a critical mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR). WP1130 treatment of murine macrophages did not alter proteasome activity but activated the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) through an IRE1-dependent mechanism. In addition, WP1130 treatment or induction of the UPR also reduced infection of other RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, Sindbis virus, and La Crosse virus but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1 endonuclease activity partially rescued the antiviral effect of WP1130. Taken together, our studies support a model whereby induction of the UPR through cellular DUB inhibition blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular DUBs and the UPR represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum antiviral therapies.",PLoS pathogens,2012,PPATHOGENS-D-11-02480 [pii],
