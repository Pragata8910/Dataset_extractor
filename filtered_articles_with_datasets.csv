40093571,Prognostic Value of Ferroptosis-Immunity-Related Signature Genes in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy Resistance and Risk Modeling.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to clarify the genome of ferroptosis in the genes involved in radiotherapy resistance and regulation of tumor immune microenvironment by multigene analysis of cervical cancer (CC) patients. METHODS: Different radiation sensitivity samples from CC patients were collected for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the RNA dataset and the GSE9750 dataset were considered as radiotherapy-DEGs. The intersection genes of radiotherapy-DEGs with ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and the intersection genes of radiotherapy-DEGs with immune-related genes (IRGs) were labeled as FRGs-IRGs-DEGs (FIGs). A risk model was established by prognostic genes selected from FIGs by univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. The results were further validated using samples from CC tissue samples. RESULTS: The 329 DEGs related to CC radiotherapy were identified. LSAAO analysis was utilized to identify five prognostic genes (CALCRL, UCHL1, GNRH1, ACVRL1, and MUC1) from six candidate prognosis genes and construct a risk model. The risk model demonstrated favorable effectiveness in predicting outcomes at 1, 3, and 5 years, as evidenced by ROC curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that CALCRL, GNRH1, and MUC1 were independent prognostic factors. The results of functional similarity analysis showed that CALCRL, UCHL1, ACVRL1 and MUC1 had high average functional similarity. The results of PCR and IHC showed the same trend with the results above. DISCUSSION: A novel prognostic model related to ferroptosis and immune microenvironment in CC radiotherapy was developed and validated, providing valuable guidance for personalized anti-cancer therapy.",True
40051782,PCBP2 promotes immune evasion via cGAS-STING pathway in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.,"Immunotherapy resistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), primarily due to immune evasion mechanisms. This study aims to explore cancer-intrinsic immune evasion-related genes (CIERGs) in PCa and develop a predictive signature for biochemical recurrence (BCR). Bulk RNA-seq data and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) were obtained from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus database. The scRNA-seq data analysis revealed higher immune evasion scores in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Differentially expressed genes from TCGA-PRAD and GSE70769 cohorts were intersected with 182 core immune evasion genes, followed by univariate Cox regression, identifying 48 CIERGs significantly associated with BCR. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering revealed two immune evasion-related PCa subtypes. A risk signature based on CIERGs was developed using LASSO regression, and a nomogram was created to predict BCR-free survival. Among the 48 identified CIERGs, poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) emerged as a key risk factor associated with poor prognosis in PCa, and its function was validated in vitro. NMF clustering identified two subtypes, with the C1 subtype having a poorer prognosis. Gene Set Variation Analysis highlighted enrichment in cell cycle, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways in the C1 subtype. A CIERGs-based risk signature, including six key genes, was developed and validated, with the nomogram showing high predictive accuracy. In vitro experiments showed PCBP2 promotes PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-STING pathway. The CIERGs signature provides a precise prediction of BCR, with PCBP2 emerging as a potential therapeutic target due to its inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway in PCa.",True
39994616,Identification of CSRP1 as novel biomarker for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer by the combination of clinical and functional research.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second most common malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. A critical challenge lies in accurately identifying those patients at high risk for transitioning rapidly from hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) to lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). In our study, we employed a multiomics approach involving bioinformatics analysis on datasets GSE2443 and GSE35988, along with proteomics studies, to discover that cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) expression significantly impacts the progression of HSPC. This hypothesis was substantiated through experiments using PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, where we conducted scratch assays and apoptosis assays, all of which confirmed CSRP1's role in suppressing tumor growth. Furthermore, we elucidated the inhibitory effect of CSRP1 on tumors by performing xenograft experiments on castrated mice models. To solidify these findings in a clinical context, we constructed a nomogram model integrating CSRP1's immunohistochemistry data and clinical parameters from an actual patient cohort with HSPC. This model revealed that low CSRP1 expression indeed promotes the advancement towards CRPC. In conclusion, the level of CSRP1 expression can serve as a valuable biomarker for clinicians to predict disease progression in their patients. It has the potential to guide personalized clinical management and decision-making strategies, thereby contributing to more effective and targeted treatment approaches for HSPC patients.",True
39976849,Therapeutic implications of endoplasmic reticulum stress gene CCL3 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"This study investigated ERS-related gene expressions in CESC, identifying two molecular subtypes, P1 and P2, and constructing a precise prognostic model based on these subtypes. TCGA's whole-genome expression profiles were used to recognize these subtypes through the ConsensusClusterPlus method, further refining prognostic models with univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses validated by the GSE39001 dataset. The study analyzed the expression distribution of ERS marker genes within T cell subgroups using scRNA-seq data (GSE168652), highlighting T cell diversity. The critical role of the CCL3 gene in prognostic models was examined explicitly in CD8 + T cells from healthy individuals and CESC patients. Elevated CCL3 levels were observed in patients' CD8 + T cells compared to healthy controls. Functional experiments involving CCL3 knockdown and overexpression in HeLa and SiHa CESC cell lines were conducted to investigate its impact on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings were subsequently validated in a nude mouse model. The results demonstrated that suppressing CCL3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion significantly, while its overexpression promoted these processes. In the mouse model, CCL3 silencing reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 labeling within the tumor tissues, indicating the therapeutic potential of targeting CCL3 in CESC treatment, possibly through CD8 + T cell regulation. This study contributes new prognostic assessment tools and personalized treatment options for CESC patients, paving the way for more targeted therapies in CESC by discovering the CCL3 gene, presenting significant clinical implications.",True
39974420,Exploration of key pathogenic mechanisms and potential intervention targets of the traditional Chinese medicine Coptis chinensis in the treatment of cervical cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown potential in the treatment of cancer. This study investigated the molecular targets and mechanisms of Coptis chinensis in the treatment of cervical cancer using network pharmacology and bioinformatics. METHODS: Effective Coptis chinensis components were screened from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) platform based on the following criteria: drug-like properties (DLP) >/=0.18 and oral bioavailability (OB) >/=30%. Target genes were identified through DrugBank, while differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cervical cancer were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE7803) based on the following criteria: |log fold change| >2 and P<0.05. Common DEGs were identified through a Venn diagram analysis. The expression and prognostic relevance of the candidate genes were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Molecular docking was performed using Pubchem, Protein Data Bank (PDB), and CB-DOCK2. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to explore the potential mechanisms of DEGs. A retrospective analysis of cervical cancer patients (June 2021 to June 2022) was performed to examine the expression of key genes in the peripheral blood via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A multivariate Cox regression was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 10 effective Coptis chinensis compounds and 181 target genes were identified from the TCMSP database. The GEO analysis of GSE7803 identified 109 DEGs. The Venn diagram analysis identified the following seven shared DEGs: AR, MAOB, CDKN2A, TOP2A, CXCL8, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and SPP1. MMP1 and SPP1 were confirmed to be upregulated candidate genes in cervical cancer tissues, and to be associated with a worse prognosis [overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI), P<0.05]. Molecular docking showed that MMP1 had high binding affinity with quercetin (-9.2) while that of SPP1 was lower (-6.3). The GSEA indicated that MMP1 was involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathways, and apoptosis. The retrospective analysis demonstrated that MMP1 expression was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy and Coptis chinensis compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that high MMP1 expression and a lack of Coptis chinensis treatment were independent risk factors for a poor prognosis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MMP1 could be a predictive biomarker for cervical cancer. Coptis chinensis may exert therapeutic effects through MMP1 regulation via multiple pathways. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of MMP1.",True
39965835,[The expression of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and its relationship with prognosis based on bioinformatics].,"Objective: To investigate the role of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and its potential molecular mechanism. Methods: Gene expression data of cervical tissue were obtained from the GEO database to analyze the expression of YTHDF2 mRNA and perform pathway enrichment analysis. Patients with cervical lesions diagnosed by thinprep cytologic test in Gynecological Outpatient Department of Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Jiexiu, Shanxi Province, were selected as the research subjects. Data of cervical lesions and cervical exfoliated cells were collected. HPV infection status was detected by flow-through hybridization, and the expression of YTHDF2 mRNA was detected by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and the mediating role of HPV infection in the relationship between YTHDF2 and squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were evaluated. YTHDF2-related genes were screened from multiple datasets in the GEO and ENCORI databases, and their expression, immune infiltration, and survival analysis were performed to assess the association between YTHDF2 and prognosis. Results: Compared with normal cervical tissue, YTHDF2 was highly expressed in cervical lesion tissue (P<0.05). A total of 3 672 differentially expressed genes were screened from the dataset GSE49339. Gene Ontology analysis showed that YTHDF2 was mainly involved in transcription regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that YTHDF2 might be related to HPV infection and other signaling pathways. In the mediation analysis, chi(2) test results showed that the expression level of YTHDF2 was significantly different among groups (chi(2)=22.47, P<0.001). Trend chi(2) test further showed that the expression level of YTHDF2 was upregulated with the degree of cervical precancerous lesions (trend chi(2)=10.26, P=0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that high YTHDF2 expression increased the risk of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (OR=3.15, 95%CI: 1.93-5.15) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (OR=1.85, 95%CI: 1.01-3.39). Mediation effect analysis revealed a partial mediating effect of HPV infection between YTHDF2 and SIL, accounting for 32.02% of the total effect. Twelve YTHDF2 related genes were screened by the intersection of multiple datasets. The immune infiltration analysis results showed that YTHDF2 and related genes KLF4, E2F3 and HOXC6 were associated with immune infiltration (all P<0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis showed that low expression of KLF4 (HR=0.53, 95%CI: 0.30-0.94) and high expression of RHOB (HR=1.80, 95%CI: 1.04-3.13) were risk factors for the prognosis of cervical cancer. Conclusion: YTHDF2 is highly expressed in cervical lesions and may have been involved in the regulation of HPV infection-related pathways and its downstream related genes are related to immune infiltration and prognosis of cervical cancer, providing a theoretical basis for the study of mechanisms related to cervical lesions.",True
39857769,Identifying MTHFD1 and LGALS4 as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer Through Multi-Omics Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Background: Prostate cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide. The treatment of it is currently based on surgical removal, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy. It is crucial to improve therapeutic prospects for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer via drug target screening. Methods: We integrated eQTL data from the eQTLGen Consortium and pQTL data from UK Biobank Proteome Plasma Proteins (UKB-PPP) and deCODE health datasets. MR analyses (SMR, heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI), IVW, Wald ratio, weighted median, and MR-Egger) were used to screen candidate genes associated with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) risk. Candidate genes were further verified through TCGA-based gene expression profile, survival analysis, and immune microenvironment evaluations. TIDE analysis was utilized to investigate gene immunotherapy response. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GSE176031 dataset were used to investigate the gene expression patterns. The Drug Bank, Therapeutic Target Database and Drug Signatures Database were utilized to predict targeted drugs for candidate genes. Results: MTHFD1 and LGALS4 were identified as promising therapeutic targets for PRAD, with evidence provided at multi-omics levels. LGALS4 was predominantly expressed in malignant cells and was correlated with enhanced immune checkpoint pathways, increased TIDE scores, and immunotherapy resistance. In contrast, MTHFD1was expressed in both tumor and microenvironmental cells and was associated with poor survival. Drug target prediction suggested that there are no currently approved drugs specifically targeting MTHFD1 and LGALS4. Conclusions: Our study identified MTHFD1 and LGALS4 as potential preventive targets for PRAD. However, future experiments are warranted to assess the utility and effectiveness of these candidate proteins.",True
39650230,Overexpression of HYOU1 is associated with cisplatin resistance and may depend on m(6)A modification in patients with cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortalities among women worldwide. The chemotherapeutical platinum-based agent cisplatin (DDP) is the standard therapy for locally advanced or recurrent CC; however, platinum resistance limits its clinical benefit. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify key genes associated with DDP resistance in patients with CC and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Firstly, using the CRISPR-Cas9 dataset of CC cells derived from DepMap portal, 699 genes associated with CC cell survival were identified. Subsequently, using the gene expression profiles of normal and CC samples with a response status to DDP, derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), hypoxia upregulated 1 (HYOU1) was further identified as significantly upregulated in CC samples and patients that did not respond to DDP (non-responders) when compared with healthy controls and patients that did respond to DDP (responders), respectively, using unpaired student's t-tests. Additionally, the log-rank test revealed that the high expression of HYOU1 was significantly associated with the poor survival of patients receiving DDP. The association between the high HYOU1 expression levels and the poor survival of patients receiving DDP was validated in the remaining TCGA dataset of patients with CC. HYOU1 expression levels were positively associated with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of DDP in CC cells using data derived from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database. In vitro, western blotting experiments revealed high HYOU1 protein expression levels in DDP-resistant HeLa cells compared with their parental HeLa cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of HYOU1 resulted in an increased sensitivity of HeLa cells to DDP. Finally, using the sequence-based RNA adenosine methylation site predictor program, it was found that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) was highly enriched in HYOU1. The expression levels of the m(6)A reader, EIF3A, was positively correlated with the expression levels of HYOU1 and was upregulated in the non-response group compared with the response group in a dataset from TCGA database. Additionally, EIF3A had the highest probability of binding to the m(6)A motifs of HYOU1 compared with other genes. In GSE56363 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, the non-responders had significantly increased expression levels of EIF3A compared with the responders. In conclusion, high expression levels of HYOU1, which may be regulated by EIF3A due to m(6)A modifications, was associated with DDP resistance in patients with CC and could potentially be used as an indicator of DDP treatment resistance.",True
39625524,Identification and validation of cigarette smoking-related genes in predicting prostate cancer development through bioinformatic analysis and experiments.,"The morbidity and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) are high among elderly men worldwide. Several factors, such as heredity, obesity, and environment are associated with the occurrence of PCa. Cigarette smoking, which is also an important factor in the development of PCa, can lead to genetic alterations and consequently promote PCa development. However, the smoking-induced genetic alterations in PCa are unclear. This study aimed to identify the potential smoking-related genes associated with PCa development. The smoking-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) which included lots of PCa datasets. DEGs were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to identify the hub genes. The pathways in which these hub genes were enriched were identified. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to examine the expression of smoking-related genes in PCa samples and estimate their value in predicting tumor progression and prognosis. In total, 110 smoking-related DEGs were got from GSE68135 dataset which included microarray data of PCa patients with smoking or not and 14 smoking-related key genes associated with PCa were identified from PPI network. The expression of the following seven key genes was altered in TCGA PCa patients: EWSR1, SRSF6, COL6A3, FBLN1, DCN, CYP2J2, and PLA2G2A. EWSR1, SRSF6, FBLN1, and CYP2J2 also influenced PCa progression. Additionally, EWSR1 influenced disease-free survival. In the logistic regression model, CYP2J2, which exhibited the highest risk scores, was identified as the risk gene for PCa. We also found one of the smoking-related genes: EWSR1 was truly upregulated in clinical PCa patients and influenced PCa cells invasion and proliferation. This study identified the function of smoking-related genes involved in the progression of PCa.",True
39331229,Identification of BBC3 as a novel indicator for predicting prostate cancer development and olaparib resistance.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a commonly occurring malignancy in elderly men. Olaparib, a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, is utilized in PCa treatment. However, patients often develop resistance to olaparib after a period of treatment. Genetic alterations may play a significant role in this resistance, but the specific genes involved remain unclear. This study collected RNA-sequence data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database on both olaparib-sensitive and -resistant PCa cells to identify genes crucial for resistance. Subsequently, the enriched pathways of these genes were analyzed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify hub genes. The effect of these hub genes on PCa occurrence, progression, and prognosis was assessed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and Epigenome Atlas databases. Finally, this study validated our findings in clinical PCa samples and cells. From the GSE189186 dataset, 50 upregulated genes and 2 downregulated genes were identified in olaparib-resistant C4-2B and LNCaP cells. Utilizing the PPI network, eight upregulated genes (BBC3, TP53I3, FDXR, DDB2, CDKN1A, GADD45A, ZMAT3, and SESN1) were identified as hub genes for olaparib-resistant PCa cells. Furthermore, some of these genes were central to PCa occurrence, with BBC3 also influencing progression and prognosis. Importantly, BBC3 expression was upregulated in clinical PCa samples and affected PCa cells sensitive to olaparib, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for PCa development and olaparib resistance.",True
39263148,Methylation-related differentially expressed genes as potential prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer.,"AIM: To discover novel methylation-related differentially expressed genes (MRDEGs) for cervical cancer, with a focus on their potential for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. MATERIALS & METHODS: We integrated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. TCGA-MRDEGs were identified by analyzing differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and their correlation with gene expression. We examined GEO datasets GSE39001, GSE9750, and GSE46306 for GEO-MRDEGs. Overlapping MRDEGs were subjected to overall survival (OS) analysis to identify prognostic markers. The expression and methylation levels of these genes were validated in a total of 30 tissue samples, comprising 20 from cervical cancer patients and 10 from normal cervical tissues, using qRT-PCR and MassARRAY EpiTYPER Assay. RESULTS: A total of 314 TCGA-MRDEGs and 40 GEO-MRDEGs were identified. Intersection analysis yielded 10 overlapping MRDEGs. Notably, NOVA1, GSTM5, TRHDE, and CXCL12 were found to have reduced expression and increased methylation in cervical cancer, which correlated with poor prognosis. The methylation status and expression levels of these genes were confirmed in tissue specimens. CONCLUSION: We identified four MRDEGs as potential prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer. Their clinical utility is highlighted, but further validation in larger cohorts is required to establish their clinical significance.",True
39240303,TET3 is expressed in prostate cancer tumor-associated macrophages and is associated with anti-androgen resistance.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of TET3 in prostate cancer and its effect on the efficacy of anti-androgen therapy (ADT). METHODS: The expression of TET3 in 1965 cases of prostate cancer and 493 cases of normal prostate tissues were analyzed. The CIBERSORT algorithm evaluated the abundance of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells in 497 prostate cancers. Subsequently, the expression of TET3 in prostate cancer TAMs was analyzed using 21,292 cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). In addition, the trajectory of the differentiation process was reconstructed based on pseudotime analysis. Sensitivity prediction of prostate cancers to ADT was evaluated based on GDSC2 and CTRP databases. Another dataset GSE111177 was employed for further analysis. RESULTS: TET3 was over-expressed in prostate cancer, and the expression of TET3 in metastatic prostate cancer was higher than that in non-metastatic prostate cancer. The scRNAseq analysis of prostate cancer showed that TET3 was mainly expressed in TAM. TET3 expressed in early and active TAMs, with the activation of signaling pathways such as energy metabolism, cell communication, and cytokine production. Prostate cancer in TET3 high expression group was more sensitive to ADT drugs such as Bicalutamide and AZD3514, and was also more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs such as Cyclophosphamide, Paclitaxel, and Vincristine, and MAPK pathway inhibitors of Docetaxel and Dabrafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ADT in prostate cancer is related to the expression of TET3 in TAMs, and TET3 may be a potential therapeutic target for coordinating ADT.",True
39183420,Exploration of PVT1 as a biomarker in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor originating from the prostate gland, significantly affecting patients' quality of life and survival rates. Public data was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was constructed to classify gene modules. Functional enrichment analysis was performed through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontology annotations, with results visualized using the Metascape database. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis evaluated gene expression profiles and related pathways, constructed a protein-protein interaction network to predict core genes, analyzed survival data, plotted heatmaps and radar charts, and predicted microRNAs for core genes through miRTarBase. Two prostate cancer datasets (GSE46602 and GSE55909) were analyzed, identifying 710 DEGs. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that DEGs were primarily involved in organic acid metabolism and the P53 signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis and Metascape analyses further confirmed the significance of these pathways. After constructing the weighted gene co-expression network analysis network, 3 core genes (DDX21, NOP56, plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 [PVT1]) were identified. Survival analysis indicated that core genes are closely related to patient prognosis. Through comparative toxicogenomics database and miRNA prediction analysis, PVT1 was considered to play a crucial role in the development of prostate cancer.

39182081,Prognostic and immunological implications of heterogeneous cell death patterns in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men with a significant proportion of patients developing biochemical recurrence (BCR) after treatment. Programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms are known to play critical roles in tumor progression and can potentially serve as prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers in PCa. This study aimed to develop a prognostic signature for BCR in PCa using PCD-related genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 19 different modes of PCD to develop a comprehensive model. Bulk transcriptomic, single-cell transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical data were collected from multiple cohorts, including TCGA-PRAD, GSE58812, METABRIC, GSE21653, and GSE193337. We analyzed the expression and mutations of the 19 PCD modes and constructed, evaluated, and validated the model. RESULTS: Ten PCD modes were found to be associated with BCR in PCa, with specific PCD patterns exhibited by various cell components within the tumor microenvironment. Through Lasso Cox regression analysis, we established a Programmed Cell Death Index (PCDI) utilizing an 11-gene signature. High PCDI values were validated in five independent datasets and were found to be associated with an increased risk of BCR in PCa patients. Notably, older age and advanced T and N staging were associated with higher PCDI values. By combining PCDI with T staging, we constructed a nomogram with enhanced predictive performance. Additionally, high PCDI values were significantly correlated with decreased drug sensitivity, including drugs such as Docetaxel and Methotrexate. Patients with lower PCDI values demonstrated higher immunophenoscores (IPS), suggesting a potentially higher response rate to immune therapy. Furthermore, PCDI was associated with immune checkpoint genes and key components of the tumor microenvironment, including macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. Finally, clinical specimens validated the differential expression of PCDI-related PCDRGs at both the gene and protein levels. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we developed a novel PCD-based prognostic feature that successfully predicted BCR in PCa patients and provided insights into drug sensitivity and potential response to immune therapy. These findings have significant clinical implications for the treatment of PCa.",True
39113388,HPV18 E6/E7 activates Ca(2+) influx to promote the malignant progression of cervical cancer by inhibiting Ca(2+) binding protein 1 expression.,"Mounting studies have shown that the oncoproteins E6 and E7 encoded by the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome are essential in HPV-induced cervical cancer (CC). Ca(2+) binding protein 1 (CABP1), a downstream target of HPV18-positive HeLa cells that interferes with E6/E7 expression, was identified through screening the GEO Database (GSE6926). It was confirmed to be down-regulated in CC through TCGA prediction and in vitro detection. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that knocking down E6/E7 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas knocking down CABP1 promoted these processes. Simultaneously knocking down CABP1 reversed these effects. Additionally, the results were validated in vivo. Previous studies have indicated that CABP1 can regulate Ca(2+) channels, influencing Ca(2+) influx and tumor progression. In this study, it was observed that knocking down CABP1 enhanced Ca(2+) inflow, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Knocking down E6/E7 inhibited these processes, whereas simultaneously knocking down E6/E7 and CABP1 restored the inhibitory effect of knocking down E6/E7 on Ca(2+) inflow. To further elucidate that E6/E7 promotes CC progression by inhibiting CABP1 expression and activating Ca(2+) influx, BAPTA/AM treatment was administered during CABP1 knockdown. It was discovered that Ca(2+) chelation could reverse the effect of CABP1 knockdown on CC cells. In conclusion, our results offer a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of HPV-induced CC.",True
39044302,Prostate cancers with distinct transcriptional programs in Black and White men.,"BACKGROUND: Black men are at a higher risk of prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis and present with more high-grade PC than White men in an equal access setting. This study aimed to identify differential transcriptional regulation between Black and White men with PC. METHODS: We performed microarray of radical prostatectomy tissue blocks from 305 Black and 238 White men treated at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Differential expression, gene set enrichment analysis, master regulator analysis, and network modeling were conducted to compare gene expression by race. Findings were validated using external datasets that are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The first was a multi-institutional cohort of 1152 prostate cancer patients (596 Black, 556 White) with microarray data (GEO ID: GSE169038). The second was an Emory cohort of 106 patients (22 Black, 48 White, 36 men of unknown race) with RNA-seq data (GEO ID: GSE54460). Additionally, we analyzed androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding profiles using paired AR ChIP-Seq datasets from Black and White men (GEO IDs: GSE18440 and GSE18441). RESULTS: We identified 871 differentially expressed genes between Black and White men. White men had higher activity of MYC-related pathways, while Black men showed increased activity of inflammation, steroid hormone responses, and cancer progression-related pathways. We further identified the top 10 transcription factors (TFs) in Black patients, which formed a transcriptional regulatory network centered on the AR. The activities of this network and the pathways were significantly different in Black vs. White men across multiple cohorts and PC molecular subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest PC in Black and White men have distinct tumor transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, a highly interactive TF network centered on AR drives differential gene expression in Black men. Additional study is needed to understand the degree to which these differences in transcriptional regulatory elements contribute to PC health disparities.",True
39029755,Environmental explanation of prostate cancer progression based on the comprehensive analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls.,"OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have caused great environmental concerns. The study aims to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms between PCBs exposure and prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: To investigate the association between PCBs exposure and prostate cancer by using CTD, TCGA, and GEO datasets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to explore pathways associated with PCBs-related genes (PRGs). Using Lasso regression analysis, a novel PCBs-related prognostic model was developed. Both internal and external validations were conducted to assess the model's validity. Molecular docking was utilized to assess the binding capacity of PCBs to crucial genes. At last, preliminary experimental validations were conducted to confirm the biological roles of Aroclor 1254 in PCa cells. RESULTS: The GO enrichment analysis of PRGs revealed that the biological processes were most enriched in the regulation of transcription from the RNA polymerase II promoter and signal transduction. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that of the pathways in cancer is the most significantly enriched. Next, a PCBs-related model was constructed. In the training, test, GSE70770, and GSE116918 cohorts, the biochemical recurrences free survival of the patients with high-risk scores was considerably lower. The AUCs at 5 years were 0.691, 0.718, 0.714, and 0.672 in the four cohorts, demonstrating the modest predictive ability. A nomogram that incorporated clinical characteristics was constructed. The results of the anti-cancer drug sensitivity analysis show chemotherapy might be more beneficial for patients at low risk. The molecular docking analysis demonstrated PCBs' ability to bind to crucial genes. PCa cells exposed to Aroclor 1254 at a concentration of 1 muM showed increased proliferation and invasion capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the function of PCBs in PCa and accentuates the need for deeper exploration into the mechanistic links between PCBs exposure and PCa progression.",True

This study explores the single-cell transcriptomics of prostate cancer, determines macrophage heterogeneity, identifies prognostic gene markers, and assesses the role of PPIF in TAMs. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database (GSE176031) and transcriptome data from the TCGA were processed to characterize cell populations and identify prognostic genes in prostate cancer. Macrophage subpopulations were examined through clustering, followed by gene set scoring based on migration, activation, and proliferation. PPIF expression in macrophages was investigated using multiplex immunofluorescence staining on matched prostate cancer and adjacent non-tumoral tissues. RESULTS: The single-cell analysis identified 9,178 cells, categorized into 10 principal cell types, with macrophages constituting a significant part of the immune microenvironment. Four macrophage subgroups demonstrated distinct functional pathways: phagocytic, immune-regulatory, and proliferative. A total of 39 genes correlated with prostate cancer prognosis were identified, of which 10 carried the most significant prognostic information. Peptidylprolyl Isomerase F (PPIF) expression was significantly higher in TAMs from tumor tissue than normal tissue, indicating its potential regulatory role in the immune microenvironment. CONCLUSION: The intricate cellular architecture of the prostate cancer TME has been elucidated, with a focus on macrophage heterogeneity and functional specialization. Prognostic genes, including PPIF, were associated with survival outcomes, providing potential therapeutic targets. PPIF's prominent expression in TAMs may serve as a lever in cancer progression, warranting further investigation as a biomarker and a molecule of interest for therapeutic targeting within the prostate cancer milieu.",True
38881936,Unveiling the role of HACE1 in cervical cancer: implications for human papillomavirus infection and prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, one of the prevalent malignancies among females, is closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 (HACE1) plays pivotal roles in various cancers. This study aimed to elucidate the expression of HACE1 in cervical cancer and its correlation with clinical features. METHODS: From The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, GSE6791) datasets, we obtained RNA-Seq profiles and associated clinical information. Differential gene analysis was conducted using the R ""limma"" package. Implications for HPV infection and the overall survival (OS) of cervical cancer were determined by performing differential expression analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Immunohistochemical analyses were used to validate the expression in cervical cancer and normal cervical tissue. Further, nomogram was constructed to predict OS in cervical cancer. Whether the model was credible was evaluated according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance curves. To further evaluate the potential functions of HACE1, we conducted functional enrichment analysis. Finally, we assessed methylation levels in HPV+ and HPV- patients in the TCGA-CESC dataset. RESULTS: Utilizing TCGA and GSE6791 datasets, we observed significant upregulation of HACE1 in cervical cancer patients, particularly linked to HPV infection. Immunohistochemical staining revealed enhanced HACE1 expression in tumor tissues. Further analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between elevated HACE1 and HPV-associated proteins (E1, E6, and E7). Moreover, high HACE1 expression was associated with adverse prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that HACE1 could serve as an independent prognostic factor. We developed a prognostic model integrating HPV subtypes, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, and HACE1, exhibiting strong predictive efficacy for cervical cancer prognosis. Gene enrichment analysis indicated HACE1's potential involvement in multiple signaling pathways during cervical cancer progression, while the demethylation of cg03002526 in HPV-positive patients might contribute to HACE1 upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that HACE1 upregulation is associated with cervical cancer, particularly in HPV-positive patients. HACE1 emerges as an independent prognostic factor, linked to unfavorable outcomes.",True
38800011,Comprehensive analysis of autophagy associated genes and immune infiltrates in cervical cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common gynecological malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women. The progression of CC is significantly affected by autophagy. Our objective was to use bioinformatics analysis to explore the expression, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration of autophagy-related genes in CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a set of autophagy-related differentially expressed genes (ARDEGs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. ARDEGs were further validated by The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), GSE52903, and GSE39001 dataset. Hub genes were found by the STRING network and Cytoscape. We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene ontology analysis (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and immune infiltration analysis to further understand the functions of the hub genes. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to check the hub genes. RESULTS: A total of 10 up-regulated (CXCR4, BAX, SPHK1, EIF2AK2, TBK1, TNFSF10, ITGB4, CDKN2A, IL24, and BIRC5) and 19 down-regulated (PINK1, ATG16L2, ATG4D, IKBKE, MLST8, MAPK3, ERBB2, ULK3, TP53INP2, MTMR14, BNIP3, FOS, CCL2, FAS, CAPNS1, HSPB8, PTK6, FKBP1B , and DNAJB1) ARDEGs were identified. The ARDEGs were enriched in cell growth, apoptosis, human papillomavirus infection, and cytokine-mediated. Then, we found that low expression of MAPK3 was associated with poor prognosis in CC patients and was significantly enriched in immune pathways. In addition, the expression of MAPK3 was significantly positively correlated with the infiltration levels of macrophages, B cells, mast cell activation, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, MAPK3 was positively correlated with LGALS9, and negatively correlated with CTLA4 and CD40. CONCLUSION: Our results show that MAPK3 can be used as a new prognostic biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with CC.",True
38730195,Exploration of the influence of GOLGA8B on prostate cancer progression and the resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer to cabazitaxel.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents the final stage of prostate cancer (PCa). Cabazitaxel, a taxane chemotherapy drug, is used in treating CRPC. However, patients with CRPC eventually develop resistance to cabazitaxel, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate potential genetic alterations that may play a role in CRPC resistance to cabazitaxel. Using microarray data from the GSE158494 dataset, we identified ten critical genes (CXCL8, ITGB8, CLIP4, MAP1B, WIPI1, MMP13, CXCL1, C1S, GOLGA8B, and CXCL6) associated with CRPC cell resistance to cabazitaxel. The potential function of these key genes in PCa progression was analyzed using different databases, including Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and Epigenome Atlas (CPGEA). Our findings revealed altered expression of these genes in the development of PCa. Furthermore, CXCL1 and GOLGA8B were found to influence the disease-free survival (DFS) status of patients with PCa, with GOLGA8B affecting the overall prognosis in patients with PCa. Additionally, GOLGA8B expression was associated with the infiltration of various immune cells in PCa, and it was upregulated in clinical PCa and CRPC samples. Through CCK-8 assays, we established that GOLGA8B could influence the sensitivity of CRPC cells to cabazitaxel and docetaxel. In conclusion, we identified GOLGA8B as a crucial gene that influences PCa progression and contributes to CRPC resistance to cabazitaxel.",True
38598542,Interference with mitochondrial metabolism could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer.,"Metabolic reprogramming has been defined as a hallmark of malignancies. Prior studies have focused on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of POLG2 gene, which is reportedly responsible for encoding mitochondrial DNA genes and is implicated in the material and energy metabolism of tumor cells, whereas its function in prostate cancer has been elusive. Gene expression profile matrix and clinical information were downloaded from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data portal, and GSE3325 and GSE8511 were retrieved from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. We conducted analysis of the relative expression of POLG2, clinical characterization, survival analysis, GO / KEGG and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) enrichment analysis in R and employed STRING portal to acquaint ourselves with the protein-protein interaction (PPI). IHC (Immunohistochemical) profiles of POLG2 protein between normal and cancerous tissues were consulted via HPA (Human protein atlas) database and the immunohistochemical POLG2 were verified between para-cancerous and cancerous tissues in tissue array. At the cellular level, Mitochondrial dysfunction assay, DNA synthesis test, wound healing assay, and invasion assay were implemented to further validate the phenotype of POLG2 knockdown in PCa cell lines. RT-qPCR and western blotting were routinely adopted to verify variations of molecular expression within epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Results showed that POLG2 was over-expressed in most cancer types, and the over-expression of POLG2 was correlated with PCa progression and suggested poor OS (Overall Survival) and PFI (Progress Free Interval). Multivariate analysis showed that POLG2 might be an independent prognostic factor of prostate cancer. We also performed GO/KEGG, GSEA analysis, co-expression genes, and PPI, and observed the metabolism-related gene alterations in PCa. Furthermore, we verified that POLG2 knockdown had an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial function, proliferation, cell motility, and invasion, we affirmed POLG2 could affect the prognosis of advanced prostate cancer via EMT. In summary, our findings indicate that over-expressed POLG2 renders poor prognosis in advanced prostate cancer. This disadvantageous factor can serve as a potential indicator, making it possible to target mitochondrial metabolism to treat advanced prostate cancer.",True
38562999,An androgen receptor-based signature to predict prognosis and identification of ORC1 as a therapeutical target for prostate adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a crucial role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and contributes significantly to the development of enzalutamide resistance. In this study, we aimed to identify a novel AR-driven signature that can predict prognosis and endows potentially reveal novel therapeutic targets for PRAD. METHODS: The Seurat package was used to preprocess the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes were visualized using limma and pheamap packages. LASSO and multi-variate Cox regression models were established using glmnet package. The package ""Consensus Cluster Plus"" was utilized to perform the consensus clustering analysis. The biological roles of origin recognition complex subunit 1 (ORC1) in PRAD were determined by gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo. RESULT: We characterized the scRNA-seq data from GSE99795 and identified 10 AR-associated genes (ARGs). The ARGs model was trained and validated in internal and external cohorts. The ARGs were identified as an independent hazard factor in PRAD and correlated with clinical risk characteristics. In addition, the ARGs were found to be correlated with somatic tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels. Two groups that have distinct prognostic and molecular features were identified through consensus clustering analysis. ORC1 was identified as a critical target among these ARGs, and it ORC1 promoted proliferation and stem-like properties of PRAD cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay confirmed that AR could directly bind the promoter of ORC1. Activated AR/ORC1 axis contributed to enzalutamide resistance, and targeting ORC1 rendered PRAD cells more susceptible to enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines an AR-driven signature that AR activates ORC1 expressions to promote PRAD progression and enzalutamide resistance, which may provide novel targets for PRAD treatment.",True
38453655,Bioinformatics identification of characteristic genes of cervical cancer via an artificial neural network.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been extensively used in the field of medicine. The present hypothesis-free study sought to use an ANN to identify the characteristic genes of cervical cancer (CC). METHODS: RNA sequencing profiles were obtained from the GSE7410, GSE9750, GSE63514, and GSE52903 datasets. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and compared between the normal and CC tissues. An ANN analysis was conducted to obtain the random-forest tree and to examine differences in gene filtering. A neural network model was established using the characteristic genes of CC, while the verification accuracy of the model was examined by Cox regression. The differences in the immune infiltrating cells between the normal cervical and CC tissues were compared by CIBERSORT (an analytical tool can provide an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population). RESULTS: Nine genes' characteristics for CC were identified: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), chromosome 1 open reading frame 112 (C1orf112), helicase, lymphoid-specific (HELLS), mini-chromosome maintenance protein 5 (MCM5), mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2), kinetochore associated 1 (KNTC1), cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3), phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase interacting protein (PHYHIP), and cornulin (CRNN). CONCLUSIONS: ANN is a robust neural network model that can be used to potentially predict CC based on the gene score. It can provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms of CC.",True

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis and experimental validation of ZNF695 in CESC. METHODS: The study investigated the expression of ZNF695 in both pan-cancer and CESC, utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to assess its diagnostic value. The present study investigated the association between ZNF695 expression levels and clinical characteristics, as well as prognosis, in patients with CESC. The study explored potential regulatory networks involving ZNF695, including its association with immune infiltration, immune score, stemness index based on mRNA expression (mRNAsi), and drug sensitivity in CESC. We explored the expression of ZNF695 in CESC single cells. ZNF695 expression was validated using GSE29570. RESULTS: ZNF695 was found to be aberrantly expressed in pan-cancer and CESC. There was a significant correlation observed between an elevated level of ZNF695 expression in patients with CESC and histological grade (p = 0.017). Furthermore, a strong association was found between high ZNF695 expression in CESC patients and poorer overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.17-3.00; p = 0.009), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.16-2.98; p = 0.010), and Disease-specific Survival (DSS) (HR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.15-3.42; p = 0.014). The expression of ZNF695 in CESC patients (p = 0.006) was identified as an independent prognostic determinant. ZNF695 was associated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and so on. ZNF695 expression correlated with immune infiltration, immune score, and mRNAsi in CESC. ZNF695 expression significantly and negatively correlated with AICA ribonucleotide, BIX02189, QL-XI-92, STF-62247, and SNX-2112 in CESC. ZNF695 gene was upregulated in CESC tissues and cell lines.

38376699,Identifying the tumor immune microenvironment-associated prognostic genes for prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore novel tumor immune microenvironment (TIME)-associated biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). METHODS: PRAD RNA-sequencing data were obtained from UCSC Xena database as the training dataset. The ESTIMATE package was used to evaluate stromal, immune, and tumor purity scores. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to TIME were screened using the immune and stromal scores. Gene functions were analyzed using DAVID. The LASSO method was performed to screen prognostic TIME-related genes. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the prognosis of samples. The correlation between the screened genes and immune cell infiltration was explored using Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource. The GSE70768 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus was used to validate the expression of the screened genes. RESULTS: The ESTIMATE results revealed that high immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores and low tumor purity had better prognoses. Function analysis indicated that DEGs are involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway. In TIME-related DEGs, METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 were closely related to the prognosis. Samples with low expression levels of METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 had better survival times. Similarly, both the validation dataset and qRT-PCR suggested that METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 were significantly decreased. The three genes showed a positive correlation with immune infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified three TIME-related genes, namely, METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1, which correlated with the prognosis of patients with PRAD. Targeting the TIME-related genes might have important clinical implications when making decisions for immunotherapy in PRAD.",True
38373667,Clinical value of molecular subtypes identification based on anoikis-related lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Anoikis is a distinctive type of apoptosis. It is involved in tumor progression and metastasis. But its function in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains veiled. We aimed to develop a prognostic indicator based on anoikis-related long non-coding RNAs (arlncRNAs) and to investigate their biological function in CRPC. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Differentially expressed anoikis-related genes were extracted from two CRPC datasets, GSE51873, and GSE78201. Four lncRNAs associated with the anoikis-related genes were selected. A risk model based on these lncRNAs was developed and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prostate cancer cohorts. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoints expression, and drug susceptibility were performed based on the model. To identify the biofunction of anoikis-related lncRNA, CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry were used. RESULT: Twenty-nine anoikis-related genes were differentially expressed in the CRPC datasets. And 36 prognostic arlncRNAs were selected for the LASSO Cox analysis. Patients were subsequently classified into two subtypes by constructing an anoikis-related lncRNA based prognostic index (ARPI). The accuracy of this index was validated. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the high-ARPI group was enriched in cancer-related and immune-related pathways. Immune infiltration analysis has indicated a positive association between high-ARPI groups and increased immune infiltration. Fulvestrant, OSI-027, Lapatinib, Dabrafenib, and Palbociclib were identified as potential sensitive drugs for high-ARPI patients. In vitro experiments exhibited that silencing LINC01138 dampened the proliferation, migration and enzalutamide resistance in CRPC. Furthermore, it stimulated apoptosis and inhibited the eithelial-mesenchymal transition process. CONCLUSION: Four arlncRNAs were identified and a risk model was established to predict the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer. Immune infiltration and drug susceptibility analysis revealed a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",True
38306015,ERBB3 Overexpression is Enriched in Diverse Patient Populations with Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer and is Associated with a Unique AR Activity Signature.,"PURPOSE: Despite successful clinical management of castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC), the 5-year survival rate for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer is only 32%. Combination treatment strategies to prevent disease recurrence are increasing, albeit in biomarker-unselected patients. Identifying a biomarker in CSPC to stratify patients who will progress on standard-of-care therapy could guide therapeutic strategies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Targeted deep sequencing was performed for the University of Illinois (UI) cohort (n = 30), and immunostaining was performed on a patient tissue microarray (n = 149). Bioinformatic analyses identified pathways associated with biomarker overexpression (OE) in the UI cohort, consolidated RNA sequencing samples accessed from Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (n = 664), and GSE209954 (n = 68). Neutralizing antibody patritumab and ectopic HER3 OE were utilized for functional mechanistic experiments. RESULTS: We identified ERBB3 OE in diverse patient populations with CSPC, where it was associated with advanced disease at diagnosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed a positive correlation between ERBB3 expression and the androgen response pathway despite low dihydrotestosterone and stable expression of androgen receptor (AR) transcript in Black/African American men. At the protein level, HER3 expression was negatively correlated with intraprostatic androgen in Black/African American men. Mechanistically, HER3 promoted enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cell line models and HER3-targeted therapy resensitized therapy-resistant prostate cancer cell lines to enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: In diverse patient populations with CSPC, ERBB3 OE was associated with high AR signaling despite low intraprostatic androgen. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a direct link between HER3 and enzalutamide resistance. ERBB3 OE as a biomarker could thus stratify patients for intensification of therapy in castration-sensitive disease, including targeting HER3 directly to improve sensitivity to AR-targeted therapies.",True
38298716,"HIF-1A as a prognostic biomarker related to invasion, migration and immunosuppression of cervical cancer.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer ranks second among malignant tumors in women, exerting a significant impact on their quality of life and overall well-being. The hypoxic microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis. The present study aims to investigate the fundamental genes and pathways associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1A) in cervical cancer, aiming to identify potential downstream targets for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. METHODS: We obtained dataset GSE63514 from the Comprehensive Gene Expression Database (GEO). The dataset comprised of 24 patients in the normal group and 28 patients in the tumor group. Gene set difference analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to identify the genes related to HIF-1A expression and the specific signaling pathways involved.The association between HIF-1A and tumor immune infiltration was examined in the TCGA dataset. The WGCAN network was constructed to identify key genes within the blue module, and subsequent gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to determine the pathways and functional annotations associated with HIF-1A. The protein interaction network of the HIF-1A gene was obtained from the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape in the meantime.The function of HIF-1A and its related gene expression were verified in vivo. RESULTS: HIF-1A was a risk factor in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of cervical cancer patients. A total of 344 genes significantly correlated with the expression of HIF-1A were identified through correlation analysis, and the genes exhibiting the strongest correlation were obtained. The major signaling pathways involved in HIF-1A encompass TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, TGF-beta, JAK-STAT, and various other signaling cascades. Reinforced by qRT-PCR, we identified Integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), striatin 3 (STRN3), and endothelin-1 (EDN1) as pivotal downstream genes influenced by HIF-1A. HIF-1A is associated with immune infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, CD4(+)T cells, M0 macrophages, neutrophils, follicular helper T cells, CD8(+)T cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg). HIF-1A is associated with sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. The identification of the HIF-1A pathway and its function primarily focuses on cytoplasmic translation, aerobic respiration, cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, among others. The results of in vivo experiments have confirmed that HIF-1A plays a crucial role in promoting the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, the overexpression of HIF-1A led to an upregulation in the expressions of ITGB1, CCL2, STRN3, and EDN1. CONCLUSIONS: The role of HIF-1A in cervical cancer was determined through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. The genes potentially implicated in the tumorigenesis mechanism of HIF-1A were identified. These findings has the potential to enhance our comprehension of the progression of cervical cancer and offer promising therapeutic targets for its clinical management.",True
38206293,An endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signature featuring ASNS for predicting prognosis and immune landscape in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PRAD) is one of the common malignant tumors of the urinary system. In order to predict the treatment results for PRAD patients, this study proposes to develop a risk profile based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Based on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) cohort and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE70769), we verified the predictive signature. Using a random survival forest analysis, prognostically significant ERS-related genes were found. An ERS-related risk score (ERscore) was created using multivariable Cox analysis. In addition, the biological functions, genetic mutations and immune landscape related to ERscore are also studied to reveal the underlying mechanisms related to ERS in PRAD. We further explored the ERscore-related mechanisms by profiling a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset (GSE137829) and explored the oncogenic role of ASNS in PRAD through in vitro experiments. The risk signature composed of eight ERS-related genes constructed in this study is an independent prognostic factor and validated in the MSKCC and GSE70769 data sets. The scRNA-seq data additionally revealed that several carcinogenic pathways were noticeably overactivated in the group with high ERS scores. As one of the prognostic genes, ASNS will significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of PRAD cells after its expression is interfered with. In conclusion, this study developed a novel risk-specific ERS-based clinical treatment strategy for patients with PRAD.",True
