40184332,Association between two single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1 and 2 genes and cell proliferative prostatic diseases in Lebanon.,"The polymorphic genes PTGS1 and PTGS2 encode cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. Overexpression of these cyclooxygenases is linked to inflammation and neoplasms. This study investigated the potential association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -842A>G (rs10306114) of the PTGS1 gene and SNP-765G>C (rs20417) of the PTGS2 gene with prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Blood leucocyte DNA from 56 healthy individuals, 61 individuals with PCa, and 51 individuals with BPH were genotyped using the PCR-RFLP method. Associations were inferred by calculating odds ratios (OR) and relative risks (RR) of genotype distributions and allele frequencies. The genotypes for both SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all groups. No significant association was observed between the A or G alleles or the AA, AG, or GG genotypes of the SNP-842A>G of the PTGS1 gene and prostatic diseases. However, the C allele of SNP-765G>C of the PTGS2 gene was significantly associated with an increased risk of BPH (OR = 2.30, p-value = 0.01). Differences in the ratios of GG/GC and GG/(GC+CC) genotypes also suggested a potential association between the C allele and PCa (p-value <0.1), and the combined affected (PCa+BPH) group (p-value <0.04). The small sample size and sampling from one ethnic group are limitations of this study."
40184142,Investigating the correlation between gut microbiota and prostate cancer through a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Previous studies in observational epidemiology have suggested a potential correlation between the gastrointestinal tract microbiota and prostate cancer. However, the causal relationship between the 2 remains uncertain, our objective was to thoroughly examine the influence of the gut microbiome on the progression of prostate cancer. In this study, we focused on investigating the gut microbiome as an exposure factor, specifically analyzing data from the MiBioGen consortium, which had a substantial sample size of 18,340 participants. As our disease outcome, we utilized prostate cancer data from the FinnGen genome-wide association study, which involved 13,216 participants. To establish causal relationships, we conducted a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis employing multiple methods, including inverse variance-weighted, Mendelian randomization-Egger, maximum likelihood, and weighted median approaches. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analysis to address issues such as heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy, ensuring the robustness of our findings. The results obtained through inverse variance-weighted analysis revealed that certain microbial groups exhibited a protective effect on prostate cancer. Specifically, the phylum Verrucomicrobia, particularly the family Rikenellaceae, and the genera Anaerotruncus, Eisenbergiella, Olsenella, and Parabacteroides were found to have a beneficial impact. Conversely, the class Bacilli, class Erysipelotrichia, order Erysipelotrichales, order Lactobacillales, family Erysipelotrichaceae, and the genera Marvinbryantia, Romboutsia, Ruminococcaceae UCG002, and Sutterella had an adverse influence on prostate cancer. The sensitivity analysis did not reveal any such outliers, further strengthening the validity of our results. To summarize, a cause-and-effect connection was discovered between various types and prostate cancer. Nevertheless, additional randomized controlled experiments are required for validation."
40183693,Significance of HPV status on tumor response and treatment outcomes in endocervical adenocarcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy: a retrospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare tumor response and treatment outcomes between human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (HPVA) and HPV-independent (HPVI) endocervical adenocarcinomas (ADCs) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and to identify prognostic factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 40 patients with endocervical ADCs treated with definitive CCRT (stages I-IVA) between 2011 and 2022. Based on pathological review the cases were categorized as HPVA or HPVI ADCs. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the characteristics, complete response (CR) rates, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: Of 40 patients, 22 (55.0%) had HPVA and 18 (45.0%) had HPVI ADCs. HPVI patients had significantly higher rates of parametrial invasion (94.4% vs. 45.5%, p=0.001). CR was achieved in 57.5% of patients and was significantly more common in the HPVA group (81.8% vs. 27.8%, p=0.001). Patients with HPVI had higher recurrence rates (88.9% vs. 50.0%, p=0.016) and lower 3-year progression-free survival (PFS, 16.7% vs. 49.8%, p=0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, 38.1% vs. 80.8%, p=0.001), and overall survival (OS, 42.3% vs. 90.7%, p=0.002) rates. HPVA remained a significant factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09-10.81; p=0.035) and OS rates (HR=6.83; 95% CI=1.17-39.80; p=0.033) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: HPVI ADC was associated with a lower response to definitive CCRT and worse prognosis than HPVA ADC. These findings suggest the need for tailored treatment strategies based on the HPV status."
40181462,A gene-based predictive model for lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer: superior performance over imaging techniques.,"OBJECTIVE: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) critically impacts the prognosis and treatment decisions of cervical cancer patients. The accuracy and sensitivity of current imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI, are limited in assessing lymph node status. This study aims to develop a more accurate and efficient method for predicting LNM. METHODS: Three independent cohorts were merged and divided into training and internal validation groups, with our cohort and those from other centers serving as external validation. A predictive model for LNM in cervical cancer was established using the LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression. The diagnostic performance of the predictive model was compared with that of CT/MRI in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. RESULTS: Using RNA-seq data, four independent predictive genes (MAPT, EPB41L1, ACSL5, and PRPF4B) were identified through LASSO regression and multivariate logistic regression, and a predictive model was constructed to calculate the LNM risk score. Compared with CT/MRI, the model demonstrated higher diagnostic efficiency, with an accuracy of 0.840 and sensitivity of 0.804, compared to CT/MRI's accuracy of 0.713 and sensitivity of 0.587. The predictive model corrected 81% of misdiagnoses by CT/MRI, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The predictive model developed in this study, based on gene expression data, significantly improves the preoperative assessment accuracy of LNM in cervical cancer. Compared to traditional imaging techniques, this model shows superior sensitivity and accuracy. This study provides a robust foundation for developing precise diagnostic tools, paving the way for future clinical applications in individualized treatment planning."
40181139,Urodynamic assessment and proteomic analysis of lower urinary tract dysfunction following nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy.,"This study aimed to evaluate lower urinary tract dysfunction after radical hysterectomy using urodynamic studies and to identify urinary biomarkers for detrusor underactivity via proteomic analysis. This prospective single-center study included women who underwent nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy for cervical carcinoma. Preoperative and postoperative assessments (at 1 and 6 months) included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, urethral pressure profiling, and pressure flow studies. Detrusor contractility was assessed using the projected isovolumetric pressure (PIP1). Proteomic analysis was performed to identify urinary biomarkers associated with postoperative detrusor underactivity. Twenty-five patients were included. The total IPSS increased significantly at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. The maximum urethral closure pressure decreased significantly at 1 month and stabilized thereafter. PIP1 and voiding efficiency decreased significantly at 1 month, but improved by 6 months. Proteomic analysis revealed significant correlations between the changes in urinary ezrin, moesin, transthyretin, and PIP1 levels. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified the optimal cutoff values for these biomarkers in diagnosing detrusor underactivity (PIP1 < 30). It was concluded that nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy impairs detrusor contractility and urethral function. Additionally, urinary ezrin, moesin, and transthyretin levels may be valuable biomarkers for diagnosing detrusor underactivity."
40180929,Integrated proteogenomic characterization of localized prostate cancer identifies biological insights and subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.,"Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is highly variable in their response to therapies. Although a fraction of this heterogeneity can be explained by clinical factors or genomic and transcriptomic profiling, the proteomic-based profiling of aggressive PCa remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled the genome, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome of 145 cases of localized PCa in Chinese patients. Proteome-based stratification of localized PCa revealed three subtypes with distinct molecular features: immune subgroup, arachidonic acid metabolic subgroup and sialic acid metabolic subgroup with highest biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates. Further, we nominated NANS protein, a key enzyme in sialic acid synthesis as a potential prognostic biomarker for aggressive PCa and validated in two independent cohorts. Finally, taking advantage of cell-derived orthotopic transplanted mouse models, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunofluorescence analysis, we revealed that targeting NANS can reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment through restricting the sialoglycan-sialic acid-recognizing immunoglobulin superfamily lectin (Siglec) axis, thereby inhibiting tumor growth of PCa. In sum, we integrate multi-omic data to refine molecular subtyping of localized PCa, and identify NANS as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic option for aggressive PCa."
40180207,Viral integration and fusion transcript characteristics of possibly high-risk HPV in cervical cancer.,"HPV34, HPV66, HPV73, and HPV82 are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly high-risk HPV (pHR-HPV) types. Despite their relatively lower pathogenicity, some cervical cancer (CC) patients have been found to be infected with pHR-HPV, though the underlying pathogenic characteristics remain unclear. Using viral integration detection and RNA sequencing in 8 pHR-HPV(+) CC samples, we identified that the integration of pHR-HPV into the human genome and the formation of pHR-HPV-human fusion transcripts are critical events in cervical carcinogenesis. These events disrupt normal gene expression and favor the stable expression of oncogenes. Additionally, we discovered that pHR-HPV undergoes alternative splicing from the AGGTA motif. Despite their lower pathogenicity, pHR-HPV integration may represent a significant risk factor for CC development. Our findings underscore the importance of considering pHR-HPV infections in future HPV screening strategies and clinical management of cervical lesions, especially those associated with HPV integration."
40180167,GATA2 promotes cervical cancer progression under the transcriptional activation of TRIP4.,"The continued rise in recurrence and mortality rates of cervical cancer suggests the need to find novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies suggest that TRIP4 acts as a transcription factor to regulate cervical carcinogenesis and progression. Our aim was to explore whether the key downstream genes of TRIP4 functions same as TRIP4 in promoting cervical cancer development. We analyzed and confirmed the downstream targets of TRIP4 by RNA sequencing in cervical cancer cells with TRIP4 knockdown. The expression correlation between TRIP4 and GATA2 and the effect of GATA2 on cervical cancer cell growth were determined respectively by Western Blot, Scratch, Spheroid, and MTT analyses. Pulldown and ChIP experiments were performed to analyze the binding of TRIP4 to the promoter of GATA2. The clinical significance of GATA2 and TRIP4 expression in cervical cancer patients was analyzed by tissue microarray staining. GATA2 was highly expressed in cervical cancer tissues. Knockdown of GATA2 inhibited the growth, metastasis and stemness of cervical cancer cells and sensitized cervical cancer cells to radiation therapy. The inhibitory effect of TRIP4 knockdown on cervical cancer cells was rescued by GATA2 overexpression. Furthermore, TRIP4 could bind to the specific GATA2 promoter region, thereby activating its transcription. Clinical tissue microarray analysis indicated that the expression of TRIP4 and GATA2 was positively correlated, and high expression of both predicted a poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Our study demonstrated that GATA2 functions as the key downstream target of TRIP4 to promote cervical cancer progression and effective intervention of TRIP4/GATA2 signaling is expected to be developed as potential cervical cancer therapeutic strategy."
40179881,Engineering sonogenetic EchoBack-CAR T cells.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for solid tumors encounters challenges such as on-target off-tumor toxicity, exhaustion, and limited T cell persistence. Here, we engineer sonogenetic EchoBack-CAR T cells using an ultrasensitive heat-shock promoter screened from a library and integrated with a positive feedback loop from CAR signaling, enabling long-lasting CAR expression upon focused-ultrasound (FUS) stimulation. EchoBack-hGD2CAR T cells, targeting disialoganglioside GD2, exhibited potent cytotoxicity and persistence in 3D glioblastoma (GBM) models. In mice, EchoBack-hGD2CAR T cells suppressed GBM without off-tumor toxicity and outperformed their constitutive counterparts. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and reduced exhaustion in EchoBack-CAR T cells compared with the standard CAR T cells. This EchoBack design was further adapted to target prostate-specific membrane antigen (EchoBack-PSMACAR) for prostate cancer treatment, demonstrating long-lasting tumor suppression with minimal off-tumor toxicity. Thus, the sonogenetic EchoBack-CAR T cells can serve as a versatile, efficient, and safe strategy for solid tumor treatment."
40176904,Unravelling the antitumor mechanism of Ocoxin through cancer cell genomics.,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Many therapies are being used to treat this disease, however, new treatments are now being implemented, since they are not always effective and their secondary effects represent one of the main reasons for cancer patients' loss of life quality during the progression of the disease. In this scenario, Ocoxin is a mixture of plant extracts, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, which has shown to exert antitumor effects in many cancers. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of action of the compound in colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Analyses performed through RNA sequencing revealed that the main effect of Ocoxin appears to be the alteration of cell metabolism, especially inducing the process of ferroptosis. Nevertheless, the modulation of the cell cycle was also remarkable. Ocoxin altered 13 genes in common in all the four cancers that were not only associated to metabolism and cell cycle but were also involved in the integrated stress response and unfolded protein response, suggesting that the compound causes the induction of cell death through several pathways. Although the mechanisms vary according to the type of cancer, this study highlights the potential of Ocoxin as an adjunctive treatment to improve outcomes in cancer therapy."
40175445,A two-sample Mendelian randomization study of type 1 diabetes and the risk of 22 site-specific cancers.,"Previous observational studies have suggested a potential link between Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and site-specific cancer risk. However, the nature of this association remains uncertain due to confounding factors, reverse causation, and biases inherent in observational research. To address this gap, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to assess the causal relationship between T1D and 22 site-specific cancers. Using summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies of European ancestry, comprising data on T1D (N = 520,580) and the 22 site-specific cancers, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with T1D as instruments for our analysis. Causal relationships were primarily evaluated through inverse-variance weighting-based analyses, supplemented by three additional methods: MR-Egger, weighted median, and mode-based estimate. Sensitivity analyses were performed, excluding genetic variants with potential pleiotropic effects. The finding demonstrated a causal association between T1D and increased risks of lung cancer (OR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.004-1.033, p = 0.011), colorectal cancer (OR = 1.022, 95% CI 1.003-1.041, p = 0.019), and prostate cancer (OR = 1.018, 95% CI 1.005-1.030, p = 0.006). Conversely, T1D was associated with decreased risks of breast cancer (OR = 0.989, 95% CI 0.981-0.998, p = 0.016), lymphoma (OR = 0.999, 95% CI 0.974-0.999, p = 0.003), malignant melanoma (OR = 0.999, 95% CI 0.989-0.999, p = 0.001), and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 0.999, 95% CI 0.899-0.999, p = 0.003). Our MR study provides an evidence of causal association between T1D and altered risks of various site-specific cancers. Further research is recommended to validate this finding in diverse populations to enhance the generalizability of findings across different ethnic groups."
40175335,Systems epigenetic approach towards non-invasive breast cancer detection.,"No study has systematically compared the suitability of DNA methylation (DNAme) profiles in non-invasive samples for the detection of breast cancer (BC). We assess non-tumour DNAme in 1,100 cervical, buccal, and blood samples from BC cases and controls and find that cervical samples exhibit the largest nuber of differentially methylated sites, followed by buccal samples. No sites were significant in blood after FDR adjustment. Deriving DNAme-based classifiers for BC detection in each sample type (WID-buccal-, cervical-, or blood-BC), we achieve validation AUCs of 0.75, 0.66, and 0.51, respectively. Buccal and cervical BC-associated DNAme alterations distinguish between BC cases and controls in both surrogate and breast tissue (AUC > 0.88), yet individual sites and the directionality of methylation changes are not identical between these two sample types, and buccal sample DNAme aligns with breast methylation changes more closely. Pending additional validation, these insights may have the potential to improve non-invasive personalized BC prevention."
40173332,Voluntary Exercise Attenuates Tumor Growth in a Preclinical Model of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To examine the effects of voluntary wheel running on tumor growth and explore potential intratumoral molecular pathways responsible for the beneficial effects of voluntary wheel running on tumor formation and progression in a mouse model of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). METHODS: Male immunodeficient mice (SCID) were castrated and subcutaneously inoculated with human CWR-22RV1 cancer cells to construct CRPC xenograft model before assigned to either voluntary wheel running (VWR) or sedentary (SED) group (n = 6/group). Tumor size was measured and calculated throughout the study. After three weeks, tumor tissues were collected. mRNA expression of markers of DNA replication, Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics was determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of mitochondrial dynamics was determined by western blotting. Finally, transcriptomics analysis was performed using the tumor tissues. RESULTS: Voluntary wheel running resulted in smaller tumor volume at the initial stage and attenuated tumor progression throughout the time course (P < 0.05). The reduction of tumor volume in the VWR group coincided with lower mRNA expression of DNA replication markers (MCM2, MCM6, and MCM7), AR signaling (ELOVL5 and FKBP5) and regulatory proteins of mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1) and fusion (MFN1 and OPA1) when compared to the SED group (P < 0.05). RNA sequencing data further revealed that pathways related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and endothelial cell proliferation were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of voluntary wheel running was effective in delaying tumor formation and progression, which coincided with reduced transcription of DNA replication, AR signaling targets and mitochondrial dynamics. We further identified a downregulation in molecular pathways related to angiogenesis that may be responsible for the delayed tumor formation and progression by voluntary wheel running."
40172755,Genomic features of liquid biopsies from patients with prostate cancer with and without ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DA) is relatively rare and highly co-existent with prostate adenocarcinoma (AC). This study aimed to investigate the distinctive genomic profiles of patients with DA compared to those without. Blood samples were obtained from 144 patients (36 with DA and 108 without DA) who were diagnosed from 2017 to 2023 at West China Hospital. We performed cell-free DNA sequencing to investigate the genomic differences between patients with DA [DA(+)] and those without [DA(-)], and explored the potential associations between their mutational status and prognosis. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic alterations were included for analysis. We identified that AR pathway [16/36 (44.4%) versus 24/108 (22.2%), p = 0.017] and WNT pathway [6/36 (16.7%) versus 5/108 (4.6%), p = 0.029] mutations were significantly enriched in DA(+) compared to DA(-) patients. Mutation of FOXA1, as a key component of the AR pathway, demonstrated markedly higher prevalence in the DA(+) over the DA(-) cohort [25% (9/36) versus 4.6% (5/108), p = 0.0012]. The DNA damage repair mutation rate and the homologous recombination repair deficiency scores appeared to be comparable between the DA(+) and DA(-) patients. In the metastatic population, DA was characterized by a higher speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) mutation rate. TP53 mutation was associated with a deteriorating prognosis for both DA(+) and DA(-) patients in terms of castration-free survival. In conclusion, our findings provide further genomic insights into prostate cancer with ductal morphology and are instructive for the diagnosis and treatment of DA."
40172705,Evaluating TGF-beta1 gene expression and promoter polymorphism in cervical cancer progression.,"This study aims to investigate the TGF-beta1 gene, which has significant prognostic value for early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer, as well as TGF-beta1 gene mRNA and protein expression and the association of promoter region (-509 C>T) polymorphisms with cervical cancer (CC) development. Transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR were conducted to determine the gene expression of TGF-beta1. The PCR-SSCP and Sanger sequencing methods were employed to test and validate the TGF-beta1 -509C>T promoter polymorphism in cervical squamous cell carcinoma in comparison to control samples. TGF-beta1 is a cytokine that plays a role in tumorigenesis as well as physiological and pathological processes. It appeared as one of the most over-expressed genes identified through the clariom D transcriptome microarray, which describes its role in cancer progression. The results showed a significant TGF-beta1 upregulation in CC compared to normal cervical tissue was confirmed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. The levels of TGF-beta1 were also determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to distinguish diseased from normal individuals. TGF-beta1 ROC showed good selectivity in distinguishing malignant CC from non-malignant cervical tissues. The -509 C>T promoter polymorphism in the TGF-beta1 gene is found to be significantly more common in the disease group, and in-silico analysis (using the AliBaba2.0 gene regulation tool) confirms its correlation to the loss of myogenin transcription factor binding site, may resulting in TGF-beta1 overexpression."
40169664,Genome assembly resources of genitourinary cancers for chromosomal aberration at the single nucleotide level.,"Traditionally, the evolutionary perspective of cancer has been understood as gradual alterations in passenger/driver genes that lead to branching phylogeny. However, in cases of prostate adenocarcinoma and kidney renal cell carcinoma, macroevolutionary landmarks like chromoplexy and chromothripsis are frequently observed. Unfortunately, short-read sequencing techniques often miss these significant macroevolutionary changes, which involve multiple translocations and deletions at the chromosomal level. To resolve such genomic dark matters, we provided high-fidelity long-read sequencing data (78-92 Gb of ~Q30 reads) of six genitourinary tumour cell lines (one benign kidney tumour and two kidney and three prostate cancers). Based on these data, we obtained 12 high-quality, partially phased genome assemblies (Contig N50 1.85-29.01 Mb; longest contig 2.02-171.62 Mb), graph-based pan-genome variant sets (11.57 M variants including 60 K structural variants), and 5-methylcytosine sites (14.68%-27.05% of the CpG sites). We also identified several severe chromosome aberration events, which would result from chromosome break and fusion events. Our cancer genome assemblies will provide unprecedented resolution to understand cancer genome instability and chromosomal aberration."
40168262,Transcriptomic profile induced by calcitriol in CaSki human cervical cancer cell line.,"The vitamin D endocrine system, primarily mediated by its main metabolite calcitriol and the vitamin D receptor (VDR), plays a critical role in numerous human physiological processes, ranging from calcium metabolism to the prevention of various tumors, including cervical cancer. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the genomic regulatory effects of calcitriol in a cervical cancer model. We examined the transcriptional changes induced by calcitriol in CaSki cells, a cervical cell line harboring multiple copies of HPV16, the primary causal agent of cervical cancer. Our microarray findings, revealed that calcitriol regulated over 1000 protein-coding genes, exhibiting a predominantly repressive effect on the CaSki cell transcriptome by suppressing twice as many genes as it induced. Calcitriol decreased EPHA2 and RARA expression while inducing KLK6 and CYP4F3 expression in CaSki cells, as validated by qPCR and Western blot. Functional analysis demonstrated that calcitriol effectively inhibited key processes involved in cancer progression, including cell proliferation and migration. This was further supported by the significant downregulation of MMP7 and MMP13 mRNA levels. Our microarray results also showed that, in addition to its effects on protein-coding genes, calcitriol significantly regulates non-coding RNAs, altering the expression of approximately 400 non-coding RNAs, including 111 microRNA precursors and 29 mature microRNAs, of which 17 were upregulated and 12 downregulated. Notably, among these calcitriol-regulated microRNAs are some involved in cervical cancer biology, such as miR-6129, miR-382, miR-655, miR-211, miR-590, miR-130a, miR-301a, and miR-1252. Collectively, these findings suggest that calcitriol exhibits a significant antitumor effect in this advanced cervical cancer model by blocking critical processes for tumor progression, underscoring the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D nutritional status."
40168059,"SiaQuant Unveils Serum alpha2,3/alpha2,6 Sialylation Heterogeneities and Predicts Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.","Sialylation significantly influences tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Accurately characterizing sialylated N-glycopeptides (SGPs), particularly the linkage-specific analysis of alpha2,3,alpha2,6 sialic acids, remains a challenging yet crucial task in glycoproteomics. Notably, to date, there is a notable lack of detailed studies on alpha2,3/alpha2,6 sialylation in serum. Here, we present SiaQuant, an integrated strategy that employs liquid chromatography-ion mobility-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS), capitalizing on the distinctive separation of characteristic isomeric glycan fragments in ion mobility to accurately analyze serum alpha2,3/alpha2,6 sialylation patterns. It first provides proteome-wide insights into alpha2,3/alpha2,6 sialylation in serum, revealing three-dimensional heterogeneities across N-glycans, N-glycosites, and N-glycoproteins. Additionally, SiaQuant identifies potential candidate biomarkers for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), where the elevated level of alpha2,3/alpha2,6 sialylation was found to be associated with NACT resistance. In summary, SiaQuant offers the most comprehensive site- and linkage-specific N-glycosylation profiling of serum and shows great potential in clinical usage."
40167119,High-Purity CTC RNA Sequencing Identifies Prostate Cancer Lineage Phenotypes Prognostic for Clinical Outcomes.,"Treatment resistance remains a universal driver of lethal metastatic prostate cancer, associated with acquired genomic alterations and lineage transitions. Using a novel high-purity CTC isolation approach for CTC transcriptional profiling, we identified four lineage phenotypes differentially associated with prognosis in metastatic prostate cancer."
40166741,Causes of evolutionary divergence in prostate cancer.,"Cancer progression involves the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations that cumulatively shape the tumour phenotype. In prostate cancer, tumours can follow divergent evolutionary trajectories that lead to distinct subtypes, but the causes of this divergence remain unclear. While causal inference could elucidate the factors involved, conventional methods are unsuitable due to the possibility of unobserved confounders and ambiguity in the direction of causality. Here, we propose a method that circumvents these issues and apply it to genomic data from 829 prostate cancer patients. We identify several genetic alterations that drive divergence as well as others that prevent this transition, locking tumours into one trajectory. Further analysis reveals that these genetic alterations may cause each other, implying a positive-feedback loop that accelerates divergence. Our findings provide insights into how cancer subtypes emerge and offer a foundation for genomic surveillance strategies aimed at monitoring the progression of prostate cancer."
40166351,Stochastically Emergent Tumors offer in vivo whole genome interrogation of cancer evolution from non-malignant precursors.,"Interrogating the stochastic events underlying tumor evolution from non-malignant precursors is crucial for understanding therapy resistance. Current methods are complicated by chromosomal instability, obscuring driver identification and yielding non-representative genetics. Inspired by patient tumors that evolve without chromosomal instability, we developed Stochastically Emergent Tumors (SETs) by inducing mismatch repair deficiency in non-malignant precursors, then engrafting in mice. Barcoded SETs exhibited increased tumoral and drug target heterogeneity over current models. SETs delineated the stochastic contributions, mutational landscapes, and selective pressures distinguishing tumorigenesis from non-malignant precursor in vitro growth. SETs are an unlimited source for diverse Stochastically Emergent cell Lines (SELs), bolstering under-represented cancers. Since SETs composition dynamically reflects therapy exposure, they are a whole-genome platform for precision oncology. We identified three novel genetic drivers (ZFHX3, CIC, KMT2D) of differential prostate cancer therapy responses. These alterations are enriched in patients of African and Chinese ancestry and correlate with significant differences in survival."
40165885,"Exploring therapeutic applications of PTEN, TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, and tumour molecular subtypes in prostate cancer management.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is defined by the suppression of genes that suppress tumours and the activation of proto-oncogenes. These are the hallmarks of prostate cancer, and they have been linked to numerous genomic variations, which lead to unfavourable treatment outcomes. Prostate cancer can be categorised into various risk groups of tumour molecular subtypes grounded in the idea of genomic structural variations connected to TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and loss of PTEN. Research suggests that certain genomic alterations may be more prevalent or exhibit different patterns in prostate cancer tumours across populations. Studies have reported a higher frequency of PTEN loss and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in prostate tumours of Black/African American men, which may contribute to the more aggressive nature of the disease in this population. Thus, therapeutically important information can be obtained from these structural variations, including correlations with poor prognosis and disease severity. METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles from 1998 to 2024 were sourced from PubMed and Google Scholar. During the review process, the following search terms were employed: ""Tumour suppressor genes OR variations OR alterations OR oncogenes OR diagnostics OR ethnicity OR biomarkers OR prostate cancer genomics OR prostate cancer structural variations OR tumour and molecular subtypes OR therapeutic implications OR immunotherapy OR immunogenetics."" RESULTS: There was a total of 13,012 results for our search query: 5,903 publications from Google Scholar with the patent and citation unchecked filer options, and 7127 articles from PubMed with the abstract, free full text, and full-text options selected. Unpublished works were not involved. Except for four articles published between 1998 and 1999, all other selected articles published in 2000 and later were considered. However, papers with irrelevant information or redundant or duplicate content were not chosen for this review. Thus, 134 met the inclusion criteria and were ultimately retained for this review. CONCLUSION: This review extracted 134 relevant articles about genomic structure variations in prostate cancer. Our findings demonstrate the importance of PTEN and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and tumour molecular subtyping in prostate cancer precision medicine."
40165597,Role of SIRT7 in Prostate Cancer Progression: New Insight Into Potential Therapeutic Target.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, and understanding its molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies. SIRT7, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator in PCa progression due to its roles in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Analysis of 492 PCa samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via cBioPortal revealed that high SIRT7 expression is associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients. Mechanistically, SIRT7 deacetylates histone H3 at lysine 18 (H3K18Ac), a marker associated with aggressive tumors, suppressing tumor suppressor genes and promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular biological process in which epithelial cells undergo specific molecular and morphological changes to transform into cells with characteristics of mesenchymal cells. SIRT7 also regulates EMT, and inhibiting SIRT7 in PCa cell lines reduces cell migration and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. In summary, the clinical significance of SIRT7 expression in PCa requires further research to elucidate its mechanisms. Developing specific inhibitors targeting SIRT7's deacetylase activity is a promising therapeutic strategy. SIRT7 plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in PCa through its epigenetic control of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability. Therefore, SIRT7 may be a potential therapeutic target for PCa, and its expression could have prognostic value for PCa patients, providing important guidance for clinical monitoring and diagnosis by physicians."
40164749,Identification of drug-resistant individual cells within tumors by semi-supervised transfer learning from bulk to single-cell transcriptome.,"The presence of pre-existing or acquired drug-resistant cells within the tumor often leads to tumor relapse and metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables elucidation of the subtle differences in drug responsiveness among distinct cell subpopulations within tumors. A few methods have employed scRNA-seq data to predict the drug response of individual cells to date, but their performance is far from satisfactory. In this study, we propose SSDA4Drug, a semi-supervised few-shot transfer learning method for inferring drug-resistant cancer cells. SSDA4Drug extracts pharmacogenomic features from both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data using semi-supervised adversarial domain adaptation. This allows us to transfer knowledge of drug sensitivity from bulk-level cell lines to single cells. We conduct extensive performance evaluation experiments across multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating SSDA4Drug's superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, with only one or two labeled target-domain samples, SSDA4Drug significantly boosts the predictive performance of single-cell drug responses. Moreover, SSDA4Drug accurately recapitulates the temporally dynamic changes of drug responses during continuous drug exposure of tumor cells, and successfully identifies reversible drug-responsive states in lung cancer cells, which initially acquire resistance through drug exposure but later restore sensitivity during drug holidays. Also, our predicted drug responses consistently align with the developmental patterns of drug sensitivity observed along the evolutionary trajectory of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. In addition, our derived SHAP values and integrated gradients effectively pinpoint the key genes involved in drug resistance in prostate cancer cells. These findings highlight the exceptional performance of our method in determining single-cell drug responses. This powerful tool holds the potential for identifying drug-resistant tumor cell subpopulations, paving the way for advancements in precision medicine and novel drug development."
40164700,Racial variation in the advanced prostate cancer genome.,"BACKGROUND: Racial differences in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) genomes have not yet been fully studied. We aimed to investigate transcriptomic, mutational, and clinical differences by race in a large multi-institutional cohort of men with mCRPC. METHODS: Genomic and clinicopathologic data from four mCRPC tumor biopsy cohorts were obtained and aggregated. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed to assess pathway-level differences in gene expression by patient race. DNA alteration frequencies of known prostate cancer driver genes and clinical outcomes were compared across racial groups. RESULTS: In our cohort of 445 men with mCRPC, tumors from African American patients (N = 26) demonstrated higher expression of MYC pathway genes (FDR q = 0.03) and lower expression of IFN-gamma, IL-6/JAK/STAT3, and inflammatory pathway genes (FDR q < 0.001) compared to tumors from European American patients. TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions were observed more frequently in tumors from European American compared to African American patients (41% vs. 11%, P = 0.015). Asian patients (N = 9) and other racial groups comprised a small minority of our cohort. No differences in overall survival were noted across racial groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite demonstrating similar clinical outcomes, cancers from African Americans display distinct tumor biology. Specifically, we observed racial differences in expression of prostate cancer driver gene pathways (including potential clinically actionable pathways of IFN-gamma and JAK/STAT) and DNA alterations, including TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. Our findings highlight the importance of racial diversity in future genomic profiling and clinical trials efforts."
40163511,Generation of prostate cancer assembloids modeling the patient-specific tumor microenvironment.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among men and contributes significantly to cancer-related mortality. While recent advances in in vitro PC modeling systems have been made, there remains a lack of robust preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics across various PC subtypes-from localized PC (LPC) to castration-resistant PC (CRPC)-along with associated stromal cells. Here, we established human PC assembloids from LPC and CRPC tissue by reconstituting tumor organoids with corresponding cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), thereby incorporating aspects of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Established PC organoids exhibited high concordance in genomic landscape with parental tumors, and the tumor assembloids showed a higher degree of phenotypic similarity to parental tumors compared to tumor organoids without CAFs. PC assembloids displayed increased proliferation and reduced sensitivity to anti-cancer treatments, indicating that PC assembloids are potent tools for understanding PC biology, investigating interaction between tumor and CAFs, and identifying personalized therapeutic targets."
40161494,Establishing a Prognostic Model Correlates to Inflammatory Response Pathways for Prostate Cancer via Multiomic Analysis of Lactylation-Related Genes.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to pose substantial clinical challenges, with molecular heterogeneity significantly impacting therapeutic decision-making and disease trajectories. Emerging evidence implicates protein lactylation-a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism-in oncogenic processes, though its prognostic relevance in PCa remains underexplored. Through integrative bioinformatics interrogation of lactylation-associated molecular signatures, we established prognostic correlations using multivariable feature selection methodologies. Initial screening via differential expression analysis (limma package) coupled with Cox proportional hazards modeling revealed 11 survival-favorable regulators and 16 hazard-associated elements significantly linked to biochemical recurrence. To enhance predictive precision, ensemble machine learning frameworks were implemented, culminating in a 10-gene lactylation signature demonstrating robust discriminative capacity (concordance index = 0.738) across both primary (TCGA-PRAD) and external validation cohorts (DKFZ). Multivariable regression confirmed the lactylation score's prognostic independence, exhibiting prominent associations with clinicopathological parameters including tumor staging and metastatic potential. The developed clinical-molecular nomogram achieved superior predictive accuracy (C - index > 0.7) through the synergistic integration of biological and clinical covariates. Tumor microenvironment deconvolution uncovered distinct immunological landscapes, with high-risk stratification correlating with enriched stromal infiltration and immunosuppressive phenotypes. Pathway enrichment analyses implicated chromatin remodeling processes and cytokine-mediated inflammatory cascades as potential mechanistic drivers of prognostic divergence. Therapeutic vulnerability profiling demonstrated differential response patterns: low-risk patients exhibited enhanced immune checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness, whereas high-risk subgroups showed selective chemosensitivity to docetaxel and mitoxantrone. Functional validation in PC-3 models revealed AK5 silencing induced proapoptotic effects, suppressed metastatic potential of migration and invasion, and modulated immune checkpoint regulation through CD276 coexpression. These multimodal findings position lactylation dynamics, particularly AK5-mediated pathways, as promising therapeutic targets and stratification biomarkers in PCa management."
40160429,A multi-task domain-adapted model to predict chemotherapy response from mutations in recurrently altered cancer genes.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly utilized in oncological practice; however, only a minority of patients benefit from targeted therapy. Developing drug response prediction (DRP) models is important for the ""untargetable"" majority. Prior DRP models typically use whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing data, which are clinically unavailable. We aim to develop a DRP model toward the repurposing of chemotherapy, requiring only information from clinical-grade NGS (cNGS) panels of restricted gene sets. Data sparsity and limited patient drug response information make this challenging. We firstly show that existing DRPs perform equally with whole-exome versus cNGS ( approximately 300 genes) data. Drug IDentifier (DruID) is then described, a DRP model for restricted gene sets using transfer learning, variant annotations, domain-invariant representation learning, and multi-task learning. DruID outperformed state-of-the-art DRP methods on pan-cancer data and showed robust response classification on two real-world clinical datasets, representing a step toward a clinically applicable DRP tool."
40157293,"An integrated approach of transcriptomics, network pharmacology and molecular docking uncovers the mechanisms of 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone in treating cervical cancer.","5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF), a dietary polymethoxyflavone (PMF) with multifaceted health-promoting benefits, has recently been identified as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for cervical cancer (CCA) in our previous study. Nevertheless, its mechanisms of action involved remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we employed an integrative strategy combining transcriptomic profiling, network pharmacology, and molecular docking to systematically investigate TMF's inhibitory effects on HeLa cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 1,127 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TMF-treated HeLa cells, comprising 765 down-regulated and 362 up-regulated genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified 12 hub targets ranked by connectivity: JUN, FN1, VEGFA, FOS, ITGB3, NOTCH1, ESR1, EGF, APP, DLG4, EGR1 and ITGB2. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis demonstrated significant associations with biological processes including signal transduction, cytoplasm, protein binding, positive regulation of apoptotic cell clearance, t-tubules and extracellular matrix structural constituent conferring tensile strength. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed enrichment in 38 signaling pathways. Molecular docking simulations comfirmed good affinities between TMF and all 12 targets, exhibiting binding energies below -5.0 kcal/mol. Our findings suggest that TMF exerts antitumor activity against HeLa cells through multi-target modulation of critical pathways including Pathway in cancer, FoxO, PI3K-Akt, mTOR, AMPK and apoptosis signaling pathway. While these bioinformatics predictions provide mechanistic insights, experimental validation through q-PCR, western blotting, and surface plasmon resonance remains essential to confirm these findings. This study establishes a foundation for further exploration of TMF's therapeutic potential in CCA management."
40156736,Uncovering somatic genetic drivers in prostate cancer through comprehensive genome-wide analysis.,"Given that hereditary prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for only a small fraction of PCa phenotypes, there is still a substantial journey ahead in exploring the somatic genetic drivers contributing to sporadic PCa. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data were sourced from the GTEx dataset for prostate-specific genes, and the summary statistic information was collected for 5854 genes. Genetic associations with PCa were extracted from three well-established consortiums: the UK Biobank (9131 cases and 173,493 controls), the PRACTICAL study (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls), and the FinnGen cohort (13,216 cases and 119,948 controls). To prioritize potential causal targets, additional analysis, including the protein-protein interaction (PPI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and the single-cell-type expression analysis, was performed. Generally, a total of 150 common significant genes with the same causal association with PCa were identified. Out of the 150 genes examined, 67.33% (101/150) were found to have protein-coding functions, while only 30.67% (46/150) of these genes had prior mentions in the scientific literature. Notably, the analysis of the TCGA dataset showed that only 44.67% (67/150) of the genes produced consistent results with the Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Furthermore, the evaluation of single-cell RNA-seq data and colocalization analysis singled out MSMB as a critical gene associated with the occurrence of PCa. We pinpointed a range of prostate-specific genes that display causal associations with the onset of PCa. Among these, the MSMB gene emerged as a pivotal factor linked to PCa, demonstrating robust consistency across all four assessments, including the MR, TCGA dataset, single-cell RNA-seq data, and colocalization analysis. These findings provided fresh perspectives on the pathogenesis of PCa and presented potential targets for drug development."
40155834,Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP): a prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer linked to immune infiltration.,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer, characterized by rising global incidence and mortality, faces significant challenges due to the lack of effective early detection methods, delaying timely interventions and underscoring the need for novel biomarkers. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), implicated in cancers such as lung, colon, and cervical cancer, has emerged as a promising candidate. However, its specific roles and mechanisms in gastric cancer remain unclear, necessitating further investigation. METHODS: This study utilized data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) to assess LBP mRNA and protein expression levels in gastric cancer patients and explore their associations with clinical outcomes. Analytical techniques included volcano plots, protein-protein interaction networks, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration assessments. Furthermore, lentiviral vectors containing interference sequences targeting LBP were used to manipulate its expression in AGS and HGC-27 gastric cancer cell lines, enabling the analysis of gene knockdown effects on malignant behaviors. Western blotting (WB) was performed to validate the impact of LBP knockdown on the expression of key signaling pathway proteins. RESULTS: Our pan-cancer comparative analysis across 33 cancer types revealed significant upregulation of LBP in gastric cancer, with diagnostic ROC curve analysis yielding an AUC of 0.765. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that high LBP expression was inversely related to patient survival. Additionally, immune infiltration and functional enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of LBP in pathways crucial to cancer development, such as immune response modulation and lipid metabolism. LBP knockdown in gastric cancer cell lines reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion. WB confirmed decreased expression of P65, P-P65, STAT3, and P-STAT3 upon LBP knockdown. CONCLUSION: LBP is intricately linked to gastric cancer pathogenesis; it influences cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, thereby representing a valuable prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. This study not only highlights the potential of LBP as a therapeutic target but also provides the groundwork for future investigations into its mechanistic pathways in gastric cancer. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable. I would like to clarify that our research does not fall under clinical studies and therefore does not involve ethical concerns related to human or animal subjects. The cells used in this study are established cell lines purchased from a certified biotechnology company. All experimental procedures comply with standard research protocols and guidelines for cell line studies."
40155466,A complex phylogeny of lineage plasticity in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Aggressive variant and androgen receptor (AR)-independent castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) represent the most significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in prostate cancer. This study examined a case of simultaneous progression of both adenocarcinoma and squamous tumors from the same common origin. Using whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing from 17 samples collected over >6 years, we established the clonal relationship of all samples, defined shared complex structural variants, and demonstrated both divergent and convergent evolution at AR. Squamous CRPC-associated circulating tumor DNA was identified at clinical progression prior to biopsy detection of any squamous differentiation. Dynamic changes in the detection rate of histology-specific clones in circulation reflected histology-specific sensitivity to treatment. This dataset serves as an illustration of non-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation and highlights the importance of serial sampling at progression in CRPC for the detection of emergent non-adenocarcinoma histologies with implications for the treatment of lineage plasticity and transdifferentiation in metastatic CRPC."

40151804,Cryo-trojan mesenchymal stem cells as non-living tumor-homing supercarriers for enhanced drug delivery and immune activation in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with conventional therapies limited by systemic toxicity and poor tumor targeting. Developing innovative drug delivery systems that enhance therapeutic specificity while minimizing off-target effects is critical. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We engineered cryo-trojan human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (CT-MSCs) as non-living, tumor-homing carriers for mitoxantrone (MTX), termed CT-MTX. Cryo-treatment preserved structural integrity and chemokine receptors (CXCR4/CCR2) for tumor targeting while eliminating proliferative risks. Comprehensive evaluations included drug loading/release kinetics, in vitro tumor suppression, immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction, and in vivo efficacy/safety in prostate cancer models. RESULTS: CT-MTX demonstrated superior drug loading (116.38 mug/10(6) cells) and pH-sensitive release (74.10 % at pH 5.5), outperforming exosomes, liposomes, and living MSCs in stability and tumor-specific drug delivery. Compared to liposomes (low targeting) and nanomaterials (biocompatibility concerns), CT-MTX leveraged MSC-derived tropism without tumorigenic risks. In vitro, CT-MTX inhibited tumor proliferation (84.83 % MTX uptake), migration (4.42 % residual migration), and induced apoptosis (43.23 % late apoptosis). Mechanistically, CT-MTX triggered ICD via PAMPs release, activating CD8(+) T cells and suppressing immunosuppressive Treg. In vivo, CT-MTX selectively accumulated in tumors, reducing growth by 87.88 % and extending survival (93.30 % vs. 66.70 % in controls) with negligible systemic toxicity. Proteomics revealed enriched immune pathways like NK cell cytotoxicity, validating its dual role in direct tumor killing and immune activation. CONCLUSION: CT-MTX represents a novel, non-proliferative drug delivery platform that combines the tumor-homing capacity of MSCs with enhanced safety and controlled release, inducing ICDs for prostate cancer and other immunologically ""cold"" tumors to improve immune infiltration."
40151001,New insights into tumor microenvironment and HPV integrations in cervical cancer pathogenesis revealed by single-cell transcriptome data.,"HPV infection is common among women and can result in serious illnesses. This research utilizes single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the connection between cellular heterogeneity and HPV integrations in cervical histopathology. scRNA-seq was used to examine heterogeneity among normal patients and those in three disease stages: high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), microinvasive carcinoma (MIC), and cervical squamous epithelium carcinoma cancer (CSCC) tissues. A method was developed to identify HPV integration events from scRNA-seq data. Our results indicated an increase in squamous epithelial cells and a decrease in columnar epithelial cells as the disease progressed from normal to CSCC. We discovered HPV genes that were differentially expressed across normal patients and those in the three disease stages. Notably, HPV integration events were more common in squamous epithelial cells at the single-cell level. The ratio of HPV-integrated cells increased as the disease progressed from normal tissue to CSCC, eventually stabilizing. Several genes, such as EGR1, S100A11, S100A8, KRT5, RPL34, ATP1B1, RPS4X and EEF2, were frequently integrated by HPV across patients. In contrast, genes like PAN3, BABAM2, SPEN, TCIM-SIRLNT, TEX41-PABPC1P2 and KCNV1-LINC01608 showed frequent integration events across cells. KRT5, ATP1B1, RPS4X, PAN3 and SPEN were novel recurrent HPV-integrated genes we observed at the patient or cell level in this study. Additionally, we found that HPV genes from various HPV types exhibited integration preferences in various samples and disease stages. This provides a valuable insight into the mechanism of HPV-induced cervical cancer from a single-cell standpoint, highlighting its clinical relevance."
40150733,Integrated Machine Learning Algorithms-Enhanced Predication for Cervical Cancer from Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Data.,"Early diagnosis is critical for improving outcomes in cancer patients; however, the application of diagnostic markers derived from serum proteomic screening remains challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), encompassing deep learning and machine learning (ML), has gained increasing prominence across various scientific disciplines. In this study, we utilized cervical cancer (CC) as a model to develop an AI-driven pipeline for the identification and validation of serum biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis, leveraging mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. By processing and normalizing serum polypeptide differential peaks from 240 patients, we employed eight distinct ML algorithms to classify and analyze these differential polypeptide peaks, subsequently constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrices. Key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were systematically evaluated. Furthermore, by integrating feature importance values, Shapley values, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) values, we demonstrated that the diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) achieved by our multi-dimensional learning models approached 1, significantly outperforming the diagnostic AUC of single markers derived from the PRIDE database. These findings underscore the potential of proteomics-driven integrated machine learning as a robust strategy to enhance early cancer diagnosis, offering a promising avenue for clinical translation."
40150449,"The Interplay Between Cervicovaginal Microbiota Diversity, Lactobacillus Profiles and Human Papillomavirus in Cervical Cancer: A Systematic Review.","Background and Objectives: Interest in defining the characteristics of the cervicovaginal microbiota (CVM) in invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is growing, particularly concerning Lactobacillus species, as evidence suggests that these may differ in affected women and potentially interact with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Understanding these features could have important implications for disease management. Thus, this study aims to systematically review the main characteristics of available literature exploring the relationship between CVM diversity, Lactobacillus profiles, and HPV in ICC; Methods: A comprehensive bibliographic search was conducted across databases, including Medline, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov, in accordance with the to the PRISMA guidelines. The review included studies that met the following inclusion criteria: studies comparing CVM in women with ICC to controls, focusing on Community State Types (CSTs), Lactobacillus profiles, and microbial diversity. Exclusion criteria included commentaries, letters, reviews, and studies without control groups. Variables were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's exact tests, with statistical significance level set at 0.05. Data analysis was conducted and reviewed in a blinded manner. Results: A total of 28 studies published between 2015 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2082 patients were included, with 323 (41.9%) of the 770 cases testing positive for HPV and 327 (24.9%) of the 1312 controls testing positive for HPV. A total of 18 studies specifically examined HPV genotypes. Cervical swabs were employed in 19 out of 28 studies (67.9%), while vaginal swabs were used in 17 studies (60.7%). Additionally, two studies included samples collected via cervical biopsy (7.1%), four studies utilized cervicovaginal lavage (14.3%), and one study used a cervical brush for sample collection (3.6%). Regarding microbiota profiling, 26 studies (92.9%) employed 16S rRNA analysis, while one study (3.6%) utilized whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and another (3.6%) used 16s rDNA. A total of 10 studies (35.7%) examined the distribution of CSTs. Five studies (17.9%) reported on Lactobacillus profiles. Different levels of Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners were observed, along with variations between Lactobacillus-dominant and Lactobacillus-depleted communities. A total of 22 studies (78.6%) assessed alpha-diversity, and 17 studies (60.7%) examined beta-diversity; Conclusions: This study emphasizes the heterogeneous features of the studies exploring the association between alterations in the CVM, HPV, and the development of ICC, suggesting the need for further research to better understand this relationship. These findings could inform new strategies for prevention and treatment."
40149370,Loss of ING3 in the Prostate Leads to Activation of DNA Damage Repair Markers.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The inhibitor of growth family member 3 (ING3) acts as an epigenetic reader through physical interactions with histone-modifying enzymes and subsequent chromatin remodelling processes. It is involved in various cellular functions, such as cell cycle control, cell growth, and apoptosis. Although ING3 was assigned tumour suppressor candidate status in some types of cancers, including prostate cancer, some studies suggest it acts to promote growth. To address these contradictory reports regarding its role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, we specifically addressed the question of whether ablation of ING3 in the mouse prostate is sufficient to initiate malignant transformation of the prostate and support its (candidate) tumour suppressor status. METHODS: To generate the prostate-specific Ing3 knockout mouse, paternal inheritance of the PB-Cre4 transgene was used, while for the generation of a global knockout control, a female mouse harbouring the PB-Cre4 transgene was utilized. To determine the recombination efficiency of the Cre-LoxP system in the prostate at the Ing3 locus, a duplex probe-based digital PCR assay capable of counting undisrupted Ing3 copies was designed. The impact of DNA recombination on the protein level was investigated by immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue samples. RESULTS: In the prostate-specific knockout, digital PCR analysis revealed mosaic gene deletion. We found recombination efficiencies in the anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral prostate lobes ranging from approximately 15 to 30%. ING3 staining in the prostate was faint with no detectable differences in signal intensity between the knockout specimen and wild-type controls. This low ING3 expression in the prostate is consistent with observations of X-gal staining of an Ing3-LacZ reporter allele. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of DNA-damage-associated markers gammaH2AX and 53BP1. However, no gross anatomical abnormalities or prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions in the prostate of tissue-specific knockout animals compared to wild-type controls were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data provide evidence that disruption of ING3 expression in prostate cells does not lead to malignant transformation and challenges the idea that ING3 acts primarily in a tumour-suppressive manner. Furthermore, this work supports the crucial role of ING3 in maintaining genomic stability, and we confirmed the embryonic lethal phenotype of homozygous Ing3 null mice that is rescued by ectopic expression of ING3."
40148950,Connexin46 in the nucleus of cancer cells: a possible role as transcription modulator.,"BACKGROUND: Oncogenes drive cancer progression, but few are active exclusively in tumor cells. Connexins (Cxs), traditionally recognized as ion channel proteins, can localize to the nucleus and regulate gene expression, playing key roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Cx46, once thought to be restricted to the eye lens, has been implicated in tumor growth, though its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the nuclear presence of Cx46 in cancer cells and its potential role as a transcriptional modulator. METHODS: We employed ChIP-Seq, confocal immunofluorescence, and nuclear protein purification to assess Cx46 localization and DNA interactions. Functional assays were conducted to evaluate its effects on invasion, division, spheroid formation, and mesenchymal marker expression. Single-point mutations and molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore potential Cx46-DNA interactions. RESULTS: Cx46 mRNA upregulation was found in a variety of tumors compared to adjacent healthy tissue. In HeLa cells, which do not express Cx46, its transfection promoted proliferation, invasion and self-renewal capacity, cancer stem cell traits and mesenchymal features. Consistently, in Sk-Mel-2, which naturally express Cx46, reduced Cx46 expression led to a decrease in the similar parameters. In HeLa cells, nuclear Cx46 was detected in two forms, full length 46 kDa and a 30 kDa fragment (GJA3-30 k), ChIP-Seq experiments revealed that Cx46 binds to the DNA at intergenic and promoter regions, leading to the activation of oncogenic pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that GJA3-30 k dimerizes in a RAD50-like structure, forming stable DNA complexes. Cx46 and in some cases GJA3-30 k were detected in the nuclei of multiple cancer cell lines, including prostate, breast and skin cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel nuclear role for Cx46 in cancer, demonstrating its function as a transcriptional regulator and its potential as a therapeutic target."
40148934,Anellovirus abundance as an indicator for viral metagenomic classifier utility in plasma samples.,"BACKGROUND: Viral metagenomics has expanded significantly in recent years due to advancements in next-generation sequencing, establishing it as the leading method for identifying emerging viruses. A crucial step in metagenomics is taxonomic classification, where sequence data is assigned to specific taxa, thereby enabling the characterization of species composition within a sample. Various taxonomic classifiers have been developed in recent years, each employing distinct classification approaches that produce varying results and abundance profiles, even when analyzing the same sample. METHODS: In this study, we propose using the identification of Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs), from the Anelloviridae family, as indicators to evaluate the performance of four short-read-based metagenomic classifiers: Kraken2, Kaiju, CLARK and DIAMOND, when evaluating human plasma samples. RESULTS: Our results show that each classifier assigns TTV species at different abundance levels, potentially influencing the interpretation of diversity within samples. Specifically, nucleotide-based classifiers tend to detect a broader range of TTV species, indicating higher sensitivity, while amino acid-based classifiers like DIAMOND and CLARK display lower abundance indices. Interestingly, despite employing different algorithms and data types (protein-based vs. nucleotide-based), Kaiju and Kraken2 performed similarly. CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the critical impact of classifier selection on diversity indices in metagenomic analyses. Kaiju effectively assigned a wide variety of TTV species, demonstrating it did not require a high volume of reads to capture diversity. Nucleotide-based classifiers like CLARK and Kraken2 showed superior sensitivity, which is valuable for detecting emerging or rare viruses. At the same time, protein-based approaches such as DIAMOND and Kaiju proved robust for identifying known species with low variability."
40147164,Machine learning models for enhanced diagnosis and risk assessment of prostate cancer with (68)Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT.,"OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is highly heterogeneous, making early detection of adverse pathological features crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aims to predict PCa aggressiveness and identify radiomic and protein biomarkers associated with poor pathology, ultimately developing a multi-omics marker model for better clinical risk stratification. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 191 patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia confirmed via (68)Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT scans were analyzed. Radiomic features were extracted from scan contours, and six machine learning algorithms were used to predict malignancy and adverse pathological features like Gleason score, ISUP group, tumor stage, lymph node infiltration, and perineural invasion. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction were performed using minimum redundancy maximum relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods. Proteomics analysis on 39 patients identified protein biomarkers, followed by correlation analysis between radiomic features and identified proteins. RESULTS: The radiomics model showed an AUC of 0.938 for predicting malignant prostate lesions and 0.916 for adverse pathological features in the test set, with validation set AUCs of 0.918 and 0.855, respectively. Three quantitative radiomic features and ten protein molecules associated with adverse pathology were identified, with significant correlations observed between radiomic features and protein biomarkers. Radioproteomic analysis revealed that molecular changes in protein molecules could influence imaging biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models based on 68 Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT radiomic features performed well in stratifying patients, supporting clinical risk stratification and highlighting connections between radiomic characteristics and protein biomarkers."
40145676,The length of night shift work is closely associated with cancer risk: A pan-cancer study of Mendelian randomization study.,"Night shift work (NSW) has been associated with cancer risk in animal studies, but epidemiological evidence remains insufficient and contradictory. This study sought to investigate the causal association between NSW and 13 common cancers using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with NSW were extracted from the UK Biobank and selected as instrumental variables (IVs). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for 13 cancers were obtained from relevant consortia and biobanks. Causality was estimated using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger intercept tests, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analyses, and funnel plots, were conducted to detect pleiotropy and heterogeneity. A suggestive causal association was found between NSW duration and risks of cervical (IVW: p = 0.028) and gastric cancer (IVW: p = 0.011). No significant associations were observed for other cancers (p > 0.05). These findings suggest the need to reduce NSW duration and limit nocturnal light exposure to maintain circadian rhythms and mitigate cancer risks."
40144021,Integrative multi-omics analysis and machine learning refine global histone modification features in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality in men, characterized by significant heterogeneity in clinical behavior and treatment response. Histone modifications play key roles in tumor progression and treatment resistance, but their regulatory effects in PCa remain poorly understood. METHODS: We utilized integrative multi-omics analysis and machine learning to explore histone modification-driven heterogeneity in PCa. The Comprehensive Machine Learning Histone Modification Score (CMLHMS) was developed to classify PCa into two distinct subtypes based on histone modification patterns. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed, and drug sensitivity analysis identified potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. RESULTS: High-CMLHMS tumors exhibited elevated histone modification activity, enriched proliferative and metabolic pathways, and were strongly associated with progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Low-CMLHMS tumors showed stress-adaptive and immune-regulatory phenotypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct differentiation trajectories related to tumor aggressiveness and histone modification patterns. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that high-CMLHMS tumors were more responsive to growth factor and kinase inhibitors (e.g., PI3K, EGFR inhibitors), while low-CMLHMS tumors demonstrated greater sensitivity to cytoskeletal and DNA damage repair-targeting agents (e.g., Paclitaxel, Gemcitabine). CONCLUSION: The CMLHMS model effectively stratifies PCa into distinct subtypes with unique biological and clinical characteristics. This study provides new insights into histone modification-driven heterogeneity in PCa and suggests potential therapeutic targets, contributing to precision oncology strategies for advanced PCa."
40141159,CD44 Methylation Levels in Androgen-Deprived Prostate Cancer: A Putative Epigenetic Modulator of Tumor Progression.,"Epigenetic changes have been reported to promote the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Compared to normal prostate tissue, tumor samples from patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) show the hypermethylation of genes primarily implicated in PCa progression. A series of 90 radical prostatectomies was retrospectively analyzed. A total of 46 patients had undergone surgery alone (non-treated) and 44 had received ADT prior to surgery (treated). Promoter methylation analysis of the candidate genes possibly involved in PCa response to ADT (AR, ESR1, ESR2, APC, BCL2, CD44, CDH1, RASSF1, ZEB1) was conducted by pyrosequencing. The mRNA expression of differentially methylated genes was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Intratumoral microvessel density and ERG expression were also assessed using immunohistochemistry. A statistically significant difference in CD44 promoter methylation levels was found, with higher levels in the non-treated cases, which accordingly showed lower CD44 gene expression than the treated cases. Moreover, lower ESR1 methylation levels were associated with higher ERG expression, and the CD44 methylation levels were increased in ERG-overexpressing tumors, particularly in the treated cases. Our data suggest an interplay between ERG expression and the epigenetic modifications in key genes of prostate tumorigenesis, and that CD44 promoter methylation could serve as a promising molecular biomarker of PCa progression under androgen-deprived conditions."
40141111,Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein Promotes Radiation Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer In Vitro.,"Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is an extracellular matrix protein that has recently been associated with worse patient outcomes in breast, prostate, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. This study aimed to determine whether COMP was also associated with increased progression and resistance to radiation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proliferation, migration, invasion and cell viability of wild-type and COMP overexpressing NSCLC cell lines were assessed when treated with exogenous COMP, with or without radiation. In addition, these cells were treated with inhibitors of downstream signaling intermediates of COMP. Proteomics were performed on the A549 cell line treated with COMP, radiation and inhibitors. NSCLC cells treated with COMP or overexpressing COMP had greater proliferation, migration, invasion and viability when irradiated compared to non-overexpressed cells treated with radiation alone, but this effect was reversed when treated with Src or PI3k inhibitors. The NCI-H1437 cell line exhibited a decrease in proliferation when treated with exogenous COMP, however COMP overexpression mitigated the radiation-induced reduction. Proteomics analyses indicate that COMP promotes oxidative phosphorylation and drug resistance pathways. Therefore, COMP overexpression and treatment with exogenous COMP appears to protect NSCLC cells against radiation in vitro, however treatment with inhibitors reverses COMP-mediated protection and progression."
40140219,Plant-derived recombinant macromolecular PAP-IgG Fc as a novel prostate cancer vaccine candidate eliciting robust immune responses.,"Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is a specific protein that is highly expressed in prostate cancer. In this study, we constructed two recombinant PAP fusion genes: PAP fused to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc fragment (designated PAP-Fc) and PAP-Fc fused to the endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence KDEL (designated PAP-FcK). Transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants expressing these recombinant macromolecular proteins (MPs) were generated using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and the presence of both genes was confirmed through genomic PCR. Western blot analysis validated the expression of PAP-Fc and PAP-FcK MPs, which were successfully purified via protein A affinity chromatography. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography revealed dimeric peaks for PAP-Fc (PAP-Fc(P)) and PAP-FcK (PAP-FcK(P)). Bio-transmission electron microscopy demonstrated 'Y'-shaped protein particles resembling antibody structures. Moreover, PAP-Fc(P) and PAP-FcK(P) exhibited a high association rate with human FcgammaR and FcRn. Vaccination of mice with both PAP-Fc(P) and PAP-FcK(P) resulted in increased total IgG against PAP and enhanced activation of CD4(+) T cells, comparable to mice immunized with PAP, which served as a positive control. These findings indicate that both plant-derived MPs can effectively induce adaptive immunity, positioning them as promising candidates for prostate cancer vaccines. Overall, plants expressing PAP-Fc and PAP-FcK represent a viable production system for antigenic macromolecule-based prostate cancer vaccines."
40140115,"Causal associations between liver function biomarkers and prostate cancer risk in European and East Asian populations: a univariate, multivariable, and bidirectional Mendelian Randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have indicated a potential association between liver function markers and prostate cancer (PCa), but the causal relationship of this association remains unclear. Additionally, genetic variations across populations may influence the direction and strength of this association. This study employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate the genetic causal relationship between liver function markers and PCa in European and East Asian populations. The aim was to uncover potential gene-disease associations across ancestries and provide novel insights for the prevention and treatment of PCa. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with liver function markers and PCa were selected from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as instrumental variables (IVs). Univariate, multivariable, and bidirectional MR analyses were conducted to evaluate the causal relationships between liver function markers and PCa. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was used as the primary MR approach, complemented by sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness and reliability of the findings. RESULTS: In European populations, univariate MR analysis suggested that ALT (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005) and AST (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.00, P = 0.045) were associated with a reduced risk of PCa. However, multivariable MR analysis, after adjusting for confounders, showed that these associations were no longer statistically significant. Reverse MR analysis provided no evidence supporting a causal effect of PCa on liver function markers in European populations. Sensitivity analyses revealed heterogeneity in the IVs but did not detect evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. In East Asian populations, total bilirubin (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.00, P = 0.049) and direct bilirubin (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99, P = 0.022) were causally associated with a reduced risk of PCa. After adjusting for confounders in multivariable MR, the association between total bilirubin and PCa remained significant (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P = 0.044). Reverse MR analysis suggested a causal effect of PCa on reduced ALT levels (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, P = 0.007). Sensitivity analyses did not reveal heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: The relationship between liver function markers and PCa seems to be influenced by genetic background. In East Asian populations, total bilirubin was identified as an independent protective factor against PCa, while reverse MR suggested a causal effect of PCa on reduced ALT levels. In European populations, there was insufficient evidence for a causal relationship between liver function markers and the risk of PCa. These findings may inform strategies for the clinical prevention, monitoring, and treatment of PCa, and further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these associations."
40139261,"A phase I/II trial of avelumab combinations with ivuxolimab, utomilumab, and radiation therapy in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies.","BACKGROUND: Checkpoint agonists utomilumab (4-1BB agonist) and ivuxolimab (OX40 agonist) enhance Teffector cell function. Preclinical studies suggest that combining these drugs with avelumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) can potentially synergize this effect. In addition, tissue abscopal effects of radiation therapy may improve antigen presentation, complementing PD-L1 blockade. We conducted a single institution, open-label, multi-arm, non-randomized, phase 1/2 clinical trial of avelumab in combination with ivuxolimab, with or without utomilumab, and radiation therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Herein, we present a subgroup analysis in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tumors (pancreatic, colon, gastric, and hepatocellular). METHODS: The primary objectives of this study were to assess safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities. The secondary objectives were to evaluate efficacy including response rate, progression free survival (PFS), as determined by immune-related Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with pancreatic (n = 21), colorectal (n = 8), hepatocellular (n = 1), and gastric (n = 1) cancers were included in this study. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were chills (13%), diarrhea (10%), colitis (10%), fatigue (6%), and fever (6%). There were 3 instances of grade 3 diarrhea and colitis (10%) without any other grade >/= 3 TRAEs Among the 24 patients evaluable for response, 9 (37.5%) had immune-related stable disease (irSD) and 14 (58.3%) had immune-related progressive disease (irPD). One patient had clinical progression without radiological confirmation. The median PFS was 2 months. Median OS was 5.6 months. CONCLUSION: Combining avelumab with co-stimulatory checkpoint agonists produces modest activity without added safety concerns in patients with advanced GI malignancies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03217747)."
40139210,"Local anaesthetic transperineal biopsy versus transrectal prostate biopsy in prostate cancer detection (TRANSLATE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer diagnosis requires biopsy, traditionally performed under local anaesthetic with ultrasound guidance via a transrectal approach (TRUS). Local anaesthetic ultrasound-guided transperineal biopsy (LATP) is gaining popularity in this setting; however, there is uncertainty regarding prostate sampling, infection rates, tolerability, side-effects, and cost-effectiveness. TRANSLATE was a randomised clinical trial that aimed to compare detection of Gleason Grade Group (GGG) 2 or higher prostate cancer, side-effects, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes, after LATP versus TRUS biopsy. METHODS: In this randomised clinical trial which was done at ten hospitals in the UK, patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if investigated for suspected prostate cancer based on elevated age-specific prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal examination, and if biopsy-naive having received pre-biopsy MRI on a 1.5 or higher Tesla scanner. Individuals were excluded if they had any previous prostate biopsy, extensive local disease easily detectable by any biopsy (prostate-specific antigen >50 ng/mL or entire gland replaced by tumour on MRI), symptoms of concurrent or recent urinary tract infection, history of immunocompromise, need for enhanced antibiotic prophylaxis, absent rectum, or inability to position in lithotomy. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive LATP or TRUS biopsy, using web-based software with a randomisation sequence using a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation across biopsy groups for minimisation factors (recruitment site, and location of the MRI lesion). The primary outcome was detection of GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned to treatment who had a biopsy result available). Key secondary endpoints assessing post-biopsy adverse events were infection, bleeding, urinary and sexual function, tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05179694) and at ISRCTN (ISRCTN98159689), and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Dec 3, 2021, and Sept 26, 2023, 2078 (76%) of 2727 assessed individuals were eligible, and 1126 (41%) of 2727 agreed to participate. 1044 (93%) of the 1126 participants were White British. Participants were allocated to TRUS (n=564) or LATP (n=562) biopsy, and were followed up at time of biopsy, and at 7 days, 35 days, and 4 months post-biopsy. We found GGG 2 or higher prostate cancer in 329 (60%) of 547 participants with biopsy results randomly assigned to LATP compared with 294 (54%) of 540 participants with biopsy results randomly assigned to TRUS biopsy (odds ratio [OR] 1.32 [95% CI 1.03-1.70]; p=0.031). Infection requiring admission to hospital within 35 days post-biopsy occurred in 2 (<1%) of 562 participants in the LATP group compared with 9 (2%) of 564 in the TRUS group. No statistically significant difference was observed in the reporting of overall biopsy-related complications (LATP 454 [81%] of 562 vs TRUS 436 [77%] of 564, OR 1.23 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.65]), urinary retention requiring catheterisation (LATP 35 [6%] of 562 vs TRUS 27 [5%] of 564), urinary symptoms (median International Prostate Symptom Score: LATP 8 [IQR 4-14] vs TRUS 8 [4-13], OR 0.36 [95% CI -0.38 to 1.10]), nor sexual function (median International Index of Erectile Function score: LATP 5 [2-25] vs TRUS 8 [3-24], OR -0.60 [-1.79 to 0.58]) at 4 months after biopsy. Trial participants more commonly reported LATP biopsy to be immediately painful and embarrassing compared with TRUS (LATP 216 [38%] of 562 vs TRUS 153 [27%] of 564; OR 1.84 [95% CI 1.40 to 2.43]). Serious adverse events occurred in 14 (2%) of 562 participants in the LATP group and 25 (4%) of 564 in the TRUS group. INTERPRETATION: Among biopsy-naive individuals being investigated for possible prostate cancer, biopsy with LATP led to greater detection of GGG 2 or higher disease compared with TRUS. These findings will help to inform patients, clinicians, clinical guidelines, and policy makers regarding the important trade-offs between LATP and TRUS prostate biopsy.

40138150,Advances in PSMA-Targeted Radionuclide Therapeutics.,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen targeted radionuclide therapies (PSMA-TRT) such as 177Lu-PSMA-617 hold great promise in improving clinical outcomes at various stages of prostate cancer. The FDA approval of 177Lu-PSMA-617 represents a significant advancement in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The VISION trial demonstrated improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with mCRPC who had already receive androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and taxane chemotherapy. Exploration of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in earlier stages of prostate cancer, such as in the PSMAfore trial for patients who have not received chemotherapy, holds great promise for improving long-term outcomes and delaying exposure to chemotherapy. Combining 177Lu-PSMA-617 with other therapies, including chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors, and immunotherapy, is an area of active investigation. This review will also discuss alternative radionuclides (such as actininum-225 and terbium-161) and delivery vehicles (such as PSMA-I&T), which we find promising. Predictive biomarkers and dosimetry will be crucial for identifying patients most likely to benefit from PSMA-TRT. Continued research and refinement of these therapies will lead to PSMA-targeted treatments becoming an integral part of prostate cancer management."
40136571,Unraveling the Prognostic Significance of BRCA1-Associated Protein 1 (BAP1) Expression in Advanced and Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is ranked as one of the top cancers affecting men in Western societies. BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression significance has been observed in various cancers, including prostate cancer. The search for prognostic models allowing better risk stratification and prediction of disease progression in prostate cancer patients is still of major clinical need. Our data showed that nuclear BAP1 expression is the most associated with cancer clinical outcomes and other biomarkers. The data confirmed that decreased BAP1 nuclear expression is linked to aggressive tumors and poorer prognosis. We assessed BAP1 expression in 202 cases, including advanced and castrate-resistant PCa (CRPCa). Our data indicated low BAP1 nuclear expression in advanced and castrate-resistant disease (CRPCa). Furthermore, there was a significant difference between high and low BAP1 nuclear expression relative to the patient's clinical outcome. In the present cohort, decreased BAP1 intensity exhibited a significant association with unfavorable overall survival (OS) (HR 2.31, CI: 1.38-3.86, p = 0.001) and cause-specific survival (CSS) (HR 2.44, CI: 1.24-4.78, p = 0.01). Additionally, this association was more pronounced when low BAP1 expression (high risk) was combined with other common PCa genomic alterations such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss or ETS-related gene (ERG)-positive cases, resulting in higher unfavorable OS and CSS. Conversely, high BAP1 nuclear expression (moderate and high intensity) combined with no ERG expression or PTEN (moderate or high expression), p53 (wild type), and androgen receptor (AR) (low/moderate intensity) showed better association with higher survival rates. All these data support the notion that BAP1 functions as a tumor suppressor. Integrating BAP1 status with other genomic alterations offers a more comprehensive understanding of disease aggressiveness."
40136513,Uncovering New Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Through Proteomic and Network Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa), is the second most prevalent solid tumor among men worldwide (7.3%), and the leading non-skin cancer in USA where it represents 14.9% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in 2024. This multifactorial disease exhibits substantial variation in incidence and mortality across different ethnic groups and geographic regions. Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remains widely used as a biomarker for PCa, its limitations reduce its effectiveness for accurate detection. Consequently, finding molecules that can either complement PSA and other biomarkers is a major goal in PCa research. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from healthy donors (n = 5) and patients with low- and high-risk PCa (4 and 7 subjects, respectively) and were analyzed using proteomic data-derived systems and biology approaches. The most promising proteins were further investigated by means of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to assess their associations with clinical and histopathological characteristics in a larger in silico patient population. RESULTS: By evaluating the variations in the urinary proteome as a mirror of the changes occurring in prostate tumor tissue, components of complement and coagulation cascades and glutathione metabolism emerged as hallmarks of low- and high-risk PCa patients, respectively. Moreover, our integrated approach highlighted new potential biomarkers, including CPM, KRT8, ITIH2, and RCN1. CONCLUSIONS: The good overlap of our results with what is already reported in the literature supports the new findings in the perspective of improving the knowledge on PCa. Furthermore, they increase the panel of biomarkers that could enhance PCa management. Of course, further investigations on larger patient cohorts are required."
40135937,Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Hederagenin-Regulated Mitophagy in Cervical Cancer SiHa Cells through an Integrative Approach Combining Proteomics and Advanced Network Association Algorithm.,"Hederagenin (Hed), a natural triterpenoid, exhibits antitumor potential in cervical cancer. The present study was designed to explore Hed's regulatory mechanisms on mitophagy in SiHa cervical cancer cells, employing tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics and an advanced network association algorithm (NAA). Our findings revealed that Hed decreased SiHa cell viability, induced apoptosis, and altered mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, Hed inhibited mitophagic flux under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Through TMT proteomics analysis and innovative NAA, we identified a close association between the HIF-1 signaling pathway and mitophagy. Network analysis further suggested that Hed acts on a target network centered on SRC, STAT3, AKT1, and HIF1A. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression and phosphorylation status of these targets in response to Hed. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying Hed's regulation of mitophagy in SiHa cells, offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancer treatment."
40134149,[GENOMIC CANCER TESTS AND MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING: HOW DO LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS HANDLE INFORMATION GAPS?].,"Clinicians and patients are offered a variety of genomic tests intended to assess the prognosis of cancer. Among these is the ""Decipher"" test for prostate cancer. A 71-year-old patient with prostate cancer was referred for testing by his treating doctor. The test results suggested reclassification of the patient from the intermediate-risk group for death and disease complications to the high-risk group."
40132786,Identification of key genes linking bisphenols exposure and breast cancer.,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer and is caused by the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle, family history of illness, reproductive factors, and ageing. However, increasing evidence has revealed that manufactured organic pollutants such as bisphenols are closely related to BC. Bisphenols exposure can promote the progression of BC through multiple complicated and variable molecular mechanisms. Reanalysis of existing data on this topic may reveal molecular markers with clinical value. In this study, we identified four key genes [keratin 14 (KRT14), keratin 5 (KRT5), acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (ACSL1) and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1)] related to both bisphenols exposure and BC by employing the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Cancer (TCGA-CESC) dataset; notably, KRT14 expression exhibited the most significant difference between tumour and normal tissues. Further analysis of the functions and biological processes associated with KRT14 and related regulatory molecules revealed that bisphenols exposure induces BC-promoting characteristics and aggressive behaviour-related signaling pathways, such as the steroid biosynthesis, Forkhead box (FOXO) and prolactin signaling pathways. To confirm the expression and biological effects of KRT14, we conducted relevant experiments. In vitro studies revealed that bisphenols such as bisphenol A (BPA) exposure significantly affected the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 cells by inhibiting KRT14 expression. Similarly, we also observed a decrease in KRT14 expression in BPA induced abnormal breast tissue in mice. In summary, our study revealed potential genes and pathways associated with bisphenols exposure in BC."
40132539,AVID enables sensitive and accurate viral integration detection across human cancers.,"Oncovirus infection is a key etiological risk factor of human cancers, which triggers virus integration in the host genome. Viral integration can lead to structural variation, gene dysfunction, and genome instability, promoting tumorigenesis. To support the investigation of virus-associated cancer and improve the detection of virus infection, we developed an algorithm called AVID (accurate viral integration detector) for viral integration detection. AVID was built by overcoming the existing detection limitations, enhancing sensitivity and accuracy, and expanding additional functions of viral integration detection. The performance of AVID was estimated in simulated datasets and experimentally validated datasets compared with other tools. To demonstrate its wide applicability, we also tested AVID on viral integration detection in multiple oncovirus-associated human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Taken together, our study developed an improved and applicable tool for viral integration detection and visualization to facilitate further exploration of virus-infected diseases."
40131411,Biomarkers in prostate cancer: current status and future directions in radiotherapy-statement from the Prostate Cancer Working Group of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO).,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among men in Germany. Advances in diagnostics and treatment have transformed PCa into a chronic disease. Given the heterogeneity of PCa, there is a need for additional stratification tools. This review focuses on updating the evidence for genomic classifiers (GC; Decipher [Veracyte Inc. San Diego, CA, USA], Prolaris [Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT], and Oncotype DX [Exact Sciences, Madison, WI, USA] tests) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital histopathology biomarkers (ArteraAI Prostate Test) in the context of radiotherapy (RT) for PCa. METHODS: The members of the Prostate Cancer Working Group of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) conducted an updated literature search on GCs and histopathological biomarkers in PCa, covering original articles published between January 2022 and February 2024 in the PubMed database. RESULTS: In addition to previous reviews, 11 relevant studies were identified, of which nine studies analyzed biomarkers within prospective phase II or III trials. Eight trials focused on genomic biomarkers, of which three addressed GCs in primary localized PCa, three in recurrent PCa in the setting of salvage RT, and two in metastatic castration-sensitive PCa. In localized PCa, GCs could be validated in a retrospective analysis of randomized controlled trials. Additionally, three studies reported on AI-based histopathology biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Genomic classifiers and AI-based digital histopathology models might have superior prognostic and predictive value compared to established clinical and pathological parameters in localized, recurrent, and metastatic PCa. Despite promising results, prospective validation of these biomarkers in randomized trials remains limited. This review underscores the need for further prospective trials to confirm the usefulness of these biomarkers in PCa."
40128715,The olfactory receptor OR51E2 regulates prostate cancer aggressiveness and modulates STAT3 in prostate cancer cells and in xenograft tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in the detection and treatment of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying its progression remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of the receptor OR51E2, which is commonly upregulated in prostate cancer, in the progression of this disease. METHODS: We investigated the physiological effects of OR51E2 through CRISPR-Cas9-induced monoclonal OR51E2 knockout. We assessed in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity and conducted transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of xenograft tumors derived from these knockout cells. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of differences in OR51E2-expression levels in patients from a TCGA cohort. RESULTS: OR51E2-knockout cells exhibited increased proliferation, migration, adhesion, anchorage-independent colony formation, and tumor growth rates, resulting in a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Omics analyses revealed several potential pathways associated with significant molecular changes, notably an aberration in the STAT3 pathway linked to IL-6 signaling, highlighting a connection to inflammatory pathways. TCGA cohort analysis revealed that prostate cancer patients with low tumor OR51E2 expression had a worse prognosis and a higher average Gleason grade than those with higher expression levels. Additionally, this analysis supported the putative OR51E2-related modulation of the STAT3 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: OR51E2 is regulated throughout prostate cancer progression and actively influences cancer cell physiology affecting cancer aggressiveness. Reduced OR51E2 expression may adversely affect patient outcomes, potentially through alterations in the STAT3 pathway that impact cellular responses to inflammatory signaling."
40128621,The landscape of N(6)-methyladenosine in localized primary prostate cancer.,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant internal RNA modification in humans, regulates most aspects of RNA processing. Prostate cancer is characterized by widespread transcriptomic dysregulation; therefore, we characterized the m(6)A landscape of 162 localized prostate tumors with matched DNA, RNA and protein profiling. m(6)A abundance varied dramatically across tumors, with global patterns emerging via complex germline-somatic cooperative regulation. Individual germline polymorphisms regulated m(6)A abundance, cooperating with somatic mutation of cancer driver genes and m(6)A regulators. The resulting complex patterns were associated with prognostic clinical features and established the biomarker potential of global and locus-specific m(6)A patterns. Tumor hypoxia dysregulates m(6)A profiles, bridging prior genomic and proteomic observations. Specific m(6)A sites, such as those in VCAN, drive disease aggression, associating with poor outcomes, tumor growth and metastasis. m(6)A dysregulation is thus associated with key events in the natural history of prostate cancer: germline risk, microenvironmental dysregulation, somatic mutation and metastasis."
40124621,TGF-beta-mediated activation of fibroblasts in cervical cancer: implications for tumor microenvironment and prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is a prevalent female malignancy strongly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME). This study focuses on the role of TGF-beta signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and its interaction with immune cells, aiming to elucidate its impact on CC progression. METHODS: The TME of CC patients was analyzed using scRNA-seq data and we identified the major cell types in the TME with a focus on the activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in fibroblasts. Gene modules related to the TGF-beta signaling pathway were identified by Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Using The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) dataset, a prognostic gene model was constructed by univariate Cox, LASSO Cox and multivariate Cox regression analyses. For cellular validation, the mRNA level of prognostic model-related genes was tested via quantitative real-time real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thereafter, the following assays, including cell counting kit-8, scratch and wound healing assays, were applied to assess the viability, migration and invasion of CC cells. RESULTS: Analysis at single-cell resolution identified nine major cell types in the TME, and significant activation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in fibroblasts was correlated with tumor proliferation and differentiation. Strong TGF-beta signaling communication between fibroblasts and macrophages and NK/T cells suggested a crucial role in the shaping of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. WGCNA analysis identified gene modules significantly associated with the TGF-beta signaling pathway. The prognostic model constructed based on three genes, ITGA5, SHF and SNRPN, demonstrated good predictive ability in multiple datasets, validating its potential for clinical application. Meanwhile, the cellular validation assays have revealed the higher expression of ITGA5 and SNRPN and lower expression of SHF in CC cells. Further, ITGA5 knockdown suppressed the viability, migration and invasion of CC cells. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the important role of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in CC, especially in fibroblasts on tumor microenvironment and tumor progression. The current model could effectively evaluate the prognosis of CC, providing a theoretical foundation for developing CC therapies according to the TGF-beta signaling pathway. The present results provide new perspectives for further research on the pathological mechanisms and clinical management of CC."
40122809,Blood-based detection of MMP11 as a marker of prostate cancer progression regulated by the ALDH1A1-TGF-beta1 signaling mechanism.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common type of tumor diagnosed in men and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in male patients. The response of metastatic disease to standard treatment is heterogeneous. As for now, there is no curative treatment option available for metastatic PCa, and the clinical tests capable of predicting metastatic dissemination and metastatic response to the therapies are lacking. Our recent study identified aldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 as critical regulators of PCa metastases. Still, the exact mechanisms mediating the role of these proteins in PCa metastatic dissemination remain not fully understood, and plasma-based biomarkers of these metastatic mechanisms are not available. METHODS: Genetic silencing, gene overexpression, or treatment with different concentrations of the retinoic acid (RA) isomers, which are the products of ALDH catalytic activity, were used to modulate the interplay between retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and androgen receptor (AR). RNA sequencing (RNAseq), reporter gene assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis were employed to validate the role of RARs and AR in the regulation of the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFB1) expression. Gene expression levels of ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, and the matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11) and their correlation with pathological parameters and clinical outcomes were analysed by mining several publicly available patient datasets as well as our multi-center transcriptomic dataset from patients with high-risk and locally advanced PCa. The level of MMP11 protein was analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in independent cohorts of plasma samples from patients with primary or metastatic PCa and healthy donors, while plasma proteome profiles were obtained for selected subsets of PCa patients. RESULTS: We could show that ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 genes differently regulate TGFB1 expression in a RAR- and AR-dependent manner. We further observed that the TGF-beta1 pathway contributes to the regulation of the MMPs, including MMP11. We have confirmed the relevance of MMP11 as a promising clinical marker for PCa using several independent gene expression datasets. Further, we have validated plasma MMP11 level as a prognostic biomarker in patients with metastatic PCa. Finally, we proposed a hypothetical ALDH1A1/MMP11-related plasma proteome-based prognostic signature. CONCLUSIONS: TGFB1/MMP11 signaling contributes to the ALDH1A1-driven PCa metastases. MMP11 is a promising blood-based biomarker of PCa progression."
40121389,"Gut microbiome, dietary habits, and prostate cancer: a two-step Mendelian randomization revealing the causal associations.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that diet fizzy drinks may contribute to prostate cancer (PCa) development. However, the causal effects between diet fizzy drinks and PCa and whether gut microbiota (GM) act as a mediator remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses utilizing large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from the UK Biobank, the MiBioGen consortium, and PCa-related datasets. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used to evaluate the causal effects of GM and dietary preferences on PCa risk. A mediation analysis was performed to investigate whether GM mediates the relationship between dietary factors and PCa risk. RESULTS: Diet fizzy drink consumption was causally associated with reduced PCa risk (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.99, P = 0.041) and decreased abundance of PCa-risk-related GM taxa (Negativicutes and Selenomonadales). Mediation analysis did not reveal a statistically significant mediation effect, with a mediation proportion of 16% (95% CI: - 0.06-0.37, P = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Consumption of diet fizzy drinks may reduce the risk of PCa, potentially through modulation of the GM; however, further studies are required to confirm these findings and clarify underlying mechanisms."
40121357,Therapeutic potential of synthetic microRNA mimics based on the miR-15/107 consensus sequence.,"MicroRNA expression is frequently suppressed in cancer, and previously we demonstrated coordinate downregulation of multiple related microRNAs of the miR-15/107 group in malignant pleural mesothelioma (PM). From an alignment of the miR-15 family and the related miR-103/107, we derived a consensus sequence and used this to generate synthetic mimics. The synthetic mimics displayed tumour suppressor activity in PM cells in vitro, which was greater than that of a mimic based on the native miR-16 sequence. These mimics were also growth inhibitory in cells from non-small cell lung (NSCLC), prostate, breast and colorectal cancer, and sensitised all cell lines to the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine. The increased activity corresponded to enhanced inhibition of the expression of target genes and was associated with an increase in predicted binding to target sites, and proteomic analysis revealed a strong effect on proteins involved in RNA and DNA processes. Applying the novel consensus mimics to xenograft models of PM and NSCLC in vivo using EGFR-targeted nanocells loaded with mimic led to tumour growth inhibition. These results suggest that mimics based on the consensus sequence of the miR-15/107 group have therapeutic potential in a range of cancer types."
40121105,Application of RNA sequencing in urologic malignancies: Advances and challenges.,"RNA sequencing became a key tool in identifying the differences between cells and their functions, aiding in the recognition of the functional elements disrupted during the disease process. In urologic malignancies, many studies aiming to provide comprehensive molecular classifications through the assessment of RNA expression or fusion analysis have been published. The distinctive presence of these molecular alterations related to cancer development, growth, and survival and the discoveries of these breakthrough studies provide insight into the development of personalized management and aid in the identification of new therapeutic targets."
40119331,Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to explore the pharmacodynamic components and mechanism of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba reversing Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacodynamic components of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba reversing Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were investigated by network pharmacology, and the mechanism of action was analyzed by molecular docking technology. METHODS: The effective components and targets of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba and the disease target of CIN were searched in TCMSP, Pubchem, Swiss Target Prediction, GenCards, WebGestalt, and STRING. Based on the above data and the Cytoscape software, we mapped the protein-protein interaction (PPI) co-expression network. The mechanism of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba CIN treatment was identified from the enrichment analysis perspective. We performed molecular docking on the AutoDock. Finally, we carried out cell experiments for verification. RESULTS: Eighty-five targets matching the active ingredients of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba, and 2512 CIN-related action targets were obtained. The nodal degree values of five components and the target of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba in the top 5 were IL6, IL1beta, TNF, TP53, and PTGS2. There were 52 intersection targets of the effective active ingredient of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba and CIN. The PPI network map suggested that the main active ingredient MOL000098 (Quercetin) had the most targets (40), followed by MOL000351 (Rhamnazin) (17). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis yielded the regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, cytoplasm, extracellular space and enzyme binding, zinc ion binding, etc. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway identified 114 signaling pathways. These pathways were mainly enriched in positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, positive regulation of gene expression, cytoplasm, extracellular space, enzyme binding, zinc ion binding, Pathways in cancer, Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, etc. The binding energies of IL6, IL1beta, TNF, TP53, and PTGS2 with Quercetin, Rhamnazin, Gypenoside XXVII_qt and Gypenoside XXVIII_qt were all less than -5 kcal.mol(-1), respectively. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions of IL6, IL1beta, TNF, and PTGS2 in the experimental group were higher (t = 105.700, 32.450, 18.190, and 100.400, all P < 0.001), and the mRNA expressions of TP53 was lower compared with the control group (t = 8.362, all P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba may reverse CIN through targeted action of Quercetin, Rhamnazin, and gypenosides, as well as various pathways. Our study preliminarily explored the pharmacodynamic components and mechanism of the reversal of CIN by Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba and verified the possible mechanism of action through cell and molecular biology experiments to understand the pharmacological mechanism of Gynostemmae Pentaphylli Herba in CIN and provide data reference for new drugs and clinical trials research, which will be of great significance for clinical treatment decisions."
40118049,Small-molecule RNA therapeutics to target prostate cancer.,"Tuning protein expression by targeting RNA structure using small molecules is an unexplored avenue for cancer treatment. To understand whether this vulnerability could be therapeutically targeted in the most lethal form of prostate cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we use a clinical small molecule, zotatifin, that targets the RNA helicase and translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). Zotatifin represses tumorigenesis in patient-derived and xenograft models and prolonged survival in vivo alongside hormone therapy. Genome-wide transcriptome, translatome, and proteomic analysis reveals two important translational targets: androgen receptor (AR), a key oncogene in CRPC, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), an essential cancer modulator in hypoxia. We solve the structure of the 5' UTRs of these oncogenic mRNAs and strikingly observe complex structural remodeling of these select mRNAs by this small molecule. Remarkably, tumors treated with zotatifin become more sensitive to anti-androgen therapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, ""translatome therapy"" provides additional strategies to treat the deadliest cancers."
40116537,Landscape of TET2 Mutations: From Hematological Malignancies to Solid Tumors.,"BACKGROUND: The ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme family is a key regulator of DNA methylation, responsible for the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to promote locus-specific demethylation. Thus, it is not surprising that loss or attenuation of TET enzymes is implicated in genomic hypermethylation and transcriptional reprogramming that drives cancer development. Somatic mutations in TET2 are observed in the bone marrow of 5%-10% of healthy adults over 65 years of age, imparting a hematopoietic stem cell advantage and subsequent clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a condition which is associated with increased risk of myeloid malignancy. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently reported in myeloid disorders, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Evidence suggests that TET2 mutations also affect prognosis in myeloid leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies. However, there is a paucity of collated data on the frequency of TET2 mutations in solid human cancers. OBJECTIVES: We review the published literature on TET2 mutation in human solid cancers and explore their frequency and impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: Somatic TET2 mutations are reported in numerous solid human cancers, including those arising in the skin, lung and prostate. Many of the somatic TET2 mutations reported in solid cancers are recurrent, suggesting functionality. There is also evidence to suggest that somatic TET2 mutations affect prognosis in solid human cancers."
40116305,Heterogeneous Responses to High-Dose Testosterone in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Tumors with Mixed Rb-Proficient and Rb-Deficient Cells.,"Androgen deprivation therapy remains a cornerstone in managing prostate cancer. However, its recurrence often leads to the more aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although second-line androgen receptor signaling inhibition treatments such as enzalutamide and abiraterone are available, their effectiveness against CRPC is only transient. High-dose testosterone (Hi-T) has recently emerged as a promising treatment for CRPC, primarily through the suppression of E2F and MYC signaling. However, the roles of Rb family proteins in influencing this therapeutic response remain debated. In this study, we utilized a CRPC patient-derived xenograft model that includes both Rb pathway-proficient and -deficient cell populations based on the positive or negative expression of RB family genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Rb-proficient cells displayed a robust response to Hi-T, whereas Rb-deficient cells exhibited significant resistance. Notably, our analysis indicated increased enrichment of the hypoxia signature in the Rb-deficient cell population. Further studies in RB1-silenced CRPC cell lines showed that treatment with a hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha inhibitor can restore the sensitivity of Rb-deficient cells to high-dose dihydrotestosterone treatment. In conclusion, our research provides new molecular insights into CRPC tumor cell responses to Hi-T and proposes a new strategy to resensitize Rb-deficient CRPC cells to Hi-T treatment."
40116118,Role of multi‑omics in advancing the understanding and treatment of prostate cancer (Review).,"The application of multi‑omics methodologies, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and integrative genomics, has markedly enhanced the understanding of prostate cancer (PCa). These methods have facilitated the identification of molecular pathways and biomarkers crucial for the early detection, prognostic evaluation and personalized treatment of PCa. Studies using multi‑omics technologies have elucidated how alterations in gene expression and protein interactions contribute to PCa progression and treatment resistance. Furthermore, the integration of multi‑omics data has been used in the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of innovative treatment modalities, such as precision medicine. The evolving landscape of multi‑omics research holds promise for not only deepening the understanding of PCa biology but also for fostering the development of more effective and tailored therapeutic interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The present review aims to synthesize current findings from multi‑omics studies associated with PCa and to assess their implications for the improvement of patient management and therapeutic outcomes. The insights provided may guide future research directions and clinical practices in the fight against PCa."
40115981,"Integrative Computational Analysis of Common EXO5 Haplotypes: Impact on Protein Dynamics, Genome Stability, and Cancer Progression.","Understanding the impact of common germline variants on protein structure, function, and disease progression is crucial in cancer research. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the EXO5 gene, which encodes a DNA exonuclease involved in DNA repair that was previously associated with cancer susceptibility. We employed an integrated approach combining genomic and clinical data analysis, deep learning variant effect prediction, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the effects of common EXO5 haplotypes on protein structure, dynamics, and cancer outcomes. We characterized the haplotype structure of EXO5 across diverse human populations, identifying five common haplotypes, and studied their impact on the EXO5 protein. Extensive, all-atom MD simulations revealed significant structural and dynamic differences among the EXO5 protein variants, particularly in their catalytic region. The L151P EXO5 protein variant exhibited the most substantial conformational changes, potentially disruptive for EXO5's function and nuclear localization. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that cancer patients carrying L151P EXO5 had significantly shorter progression-free survival in prostate and pancreatic cancers and exhibited increased genomic instability. This study highlights the strength of our methodology in uncovering the effects of common genetic variants on protein function and their implications for disease outcomes."
40115748,Matrix stiffness modulates androgen response genes and chromatin state in prostate cancer.,"The interplay between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and prostate cancer has been shown to increase ECM stiffness, correlating with more aggressive disease forms. However, the impact of ECM stiffness on the androgen receptor (AR), a key target in prostate cancer treatment, remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether matrix stiffness influences prostate cancer progression, transcriptional regulation, chromatin state, and AR function in AR-positive prostate cancer cells under varying ECM stiffness conditions. We utilized ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing) and RNA sequencing under different ECM conditions, along with the SUC2 metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma patient dataset, to investigate the role of ECM stiffness in chromatin state and androgen response genes, as well as its impact on prostate cancer progression. Results demonstrated that increased ECM stiffness elevated the expression of genes related to proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, androgen response genes were most highly induced in soft ECM conditions. Integrating chromatin accessibility with transcriptomic data revealed that androgen response genes were more transcriptionally available in soft ECM conditions. Additionally, increased ECM stiffness upregulated genes associated with low overall survival in the SUC2 dataset. Taken together, our results indicate that high expression of hard matrix stiffness genes may promote prostate cancer progression, leading to more aggressive disease forms associated with poor survival."
40114821,Insomnia and prostate cancer risk: insights from NHANES and gene correlation analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sleep represents a pivotal circadian physiological process that is indispensable for sustaining a normal physiological milieu within the body. The potential role of sleep disorders in contributing to the onset and progression of cancer remains elusive, prompting this study to delve into the intricate relationship between sleep disturbances, specifically insomnia, and the risk of developing prostate cancer. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between sleep disorders and prostate cancer using weighted multivariate adjusted logistic regression analysis of data from two cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2005-2008). Additionally, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted using open-access genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to assess the causal link. RESULTS: After correcting for potential confounders, the study showed that insomnia [odds ratio (OR) =1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.03; P=0.041] was positively associated with the prevalence of prostate cancer. The same findings were shown in the MR analysis of inverse variance weighting (IVW) and weighted median (WM) (OR =1.346, 95% CI: 1.048-1.730, P=0.02; OR =1.446, 95% CI: 1.030-2.030, P=0.03). After segmentation by sleep duration 0-4, 4-8, and 8+ hours, it was found that in the unadjusted model, the risk of prostate cancer was reduced in those with 8+ hours of sleep compared to those with 0-4 hours of sleep (OR =0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-1.00; P=0.047), and the total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) of the patients gradually increased with increasing sleep duration (OR =1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71, P=0.02; OR =2.62, 95% CI: 1.61-4.24, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, highlighting a causal relationship that is independent of age and emphasizing the importance of considering sleep disorders in prostate cancer research."
40114313,Causal effects of depression on prostatitis: a two-step Mendelian randomisation study with immune cell mediation.,"BACKGROUND: Depression has a significant global impact. Previous studies have suggested a link between depression and prostate diseases. However, these studies are often observational and may be influenced by confounding factors and reverse causality. This research aimed to explore the potential causal relationship between depression and prostate diseases using Mendelian randomisation (MR) and to assess the mediating role of immune cell phenotypes. METHODS: We utilised MR methods with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. The analysis was conducted in two phases: (a) a two-sample MR to investigate the impact of depression on prostate diseases; and (b) a two-step MR to evaluate the mediating effect of 731 immune cell phenotypes. Depression data were obtained from an extensive GWAS involving 480 359 participants across multiple European cohorts. Prostate disease data, including prostatitis, prostate cancer, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, were obtained from European-based GWAS. Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms related to depression were selected based on genome-wide significance criteria. Various MR methods, including inverse variance weighting, weighted median, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO, MR-Robust, and MR-RAPS, were employed to ensure robust causal inference. RESULTS: The MR analysis revealed a potential causal relationship between depression and an increased risk of prostatitis (odds ratio = 1.606, P = 8.35E-04). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these findings. Additionally, a two-step MR analysis identified CD24+ CD27+ %lymphocytes as a potential mediator, with a mediation effect of 0.108 (P = 0.03), accounting for 22.78% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers novel genetic evidence for the causal relationship between depression and prostatitis, with immune cells identified as potential mediators in this process. These findings highlight the importance of psychological factors in developing prostatitis and suggest that immune cells could be novel therapeutic targets."
40114169,Whole genome sequencing of 378 prostate cancer metastases reveals tissue selectivity for mismatch deficiency with potential therapeutic implications.,"BACKGROUND: Survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) depends on the site of metastatic dissemination. METHODS: Patients with mCRPC were prospectively included in the CPCT-02 metastatic site biopsy study. We evaluated whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 378 mCRPC metastases to understand the genetic traits that affect metastatic site distribution. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that RB1, PIK3CA, JAK1, RNF43, and TP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic determinants associated with site selectivity for metastatic outgrowth. Furthermore, we explored mutations in the non-coding genome and found that androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding sites implicated in metastatic prostate cancer differ in mutation frequencies between metastatic sites, converging on pathways that impact DNA repair. Notably, liver and visceral metastases have a higher tumor mutational load (TML) than bone and lymph node metastases, independent of genetic traits associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. We found that TML is strongly associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR)-deficiency features in these organs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed gene mutations that are significantly associated with metastatic site selectivity and that frequencies of non-coding mutations at AR chromatin binding sites differ between metastatic sites. Immunotherapeutics are thus far unsuccessful in unselected mCRPC patients. We found a higher TML in liver and visceral metastases compared to bone and lymph node metastases. As immunotherapeutics response is associated with mutational burden, these findings may assist in selecting mCRPC patients for immunotherapy treatment based on organs affected by metastatic disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01855477."
40113221,"Additive Value of [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT to [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT in Detecting Pelvic Lymph Node Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: A Prospective, Single-Center, Phase II Study.","Lymph node staging in prostate cancer is crucial for treatment and prognosis, yet [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT has limited sensitivity in detecting pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM). [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT, targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, complements [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT in assessing primary tumor extension and aggressiveness. However, its role in detecting PLNM and complementing [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT remains underexplored. Methods: This prospective study enrolled newly diagnosed yet untreated prostate cancer patients who underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT and [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT, followed by radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The primary objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of both PET/CT modalities in detecting PLNM. Results: In total, 68 patients were enrolled, with a 30.9% (21/68) pathologic PLNM rate. In patient-based analysis, [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT had sensitivity and specificity of 0.43 and 0.94, respectively, compared with 0.52 and 0.89 for [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT. [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT detected additional PLNMs in 50% (5/10) of patients that were missed by [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT. The combined use of [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT and [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT resulted in sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.85. In total, 1,049 lymph nodes were dissected, including 991 normal and 58 positive nodes. In lesion-based analysis, [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT had sensitivity and specificity of 0.38 and 0.99, respectively, compared with 0.5 and 0.99 for [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT. [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT identified 41.4% (12/29) of pathologic positive nodes missed by [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT. The combined [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 and [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT demonstrated sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.99. Conclusion: In dual-target imaging, [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT identified additional PLNMs. The combination of [(68)Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT and [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT achieved higher diagnostic sensitivity with minimal loss of specificity."
40112242,State of the Art: Personalizing Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Until recently, the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) relied exclusively on hormonal therapies and taxane chemotherapy. The advent of modern molecular profiling methods applied in the clinic, namely, next-generation sequencing and advanced positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, has allowed for the development of biomarker-driven therapeutics including anti-PD-L1 therapy for microsatellite instability-high or tumor mutation burden-high disease, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with DNA damage repair mutations, and lutetium 177 vipivotide tetraxetan ((177)Lu-PSMA-617) for patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-avid disease. While these targeted therapies have improved outcomes, there is an opportunity to refine biomarkers to optimize patient selection, understand resistance, and develop novel combination strategies. In addition, studies in the laboratory and in patient-derived samples have shown that a subset of mCRPC tumors lose expression of common prostate cancer markers such as prostate-specific antigen and PSMA because of lineage plasticity and the development of non-androgen receptor (AR)-driven disease. Non-AR-driven prostate cancer has been associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, including in some cases histologic transformation to a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). The clinical management of NEPC typically follows the treatment paradigm for small cell lung cancer and increasingly relies on genomic and phenotypic characterization of disease, including loss of tumor suppressors and expression of cell surface markers such as DLL3. Therefore, both genomic subtyping and phenotypic subtyping are important to consider and can guide the clinical management of patients with advanced prostate cancer."
40111849,Building research infrastructure to advance precision medicine in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Addressing critical gaps in precision medicine initiatives in colorectal cancer (CRC) requires building larger collaborative studies. METHODS: The Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3) is a resource that harmonizes data collected in observational studies with data from individuals who identify as Hispanic/Latino with a diagnosis of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. Data collected includes demographics, medical history, family history, and lifestyle risk factors from patient-completed surveys. Vital status, cause of death, treatment, and clinicopathological characteristics were obtained through medical chart abstraction, pathology reports and/or linkage to state cancer registries. Blood, saliva, or normal colonic tissues were used to extract and genotype germline DNA. Tumor tissue (snap frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) were evaluated by pathologists for diagnosis, tissue content, tumor cellularity, necrosis, immune infiltration, and additional histopathologic characteristics. A centralized database with a virtual tumor repository was created to facilitate collaborative research. RESULTS: As of April 2024, LC3 assembled data from 2,210 patients (diagnosed 1994 to 2023). The mean age at diagnosis was 57 (range: 19-93) years; 54.3% of participants were male, and 62.0% had been diagnosed with colon cancer. Surveys were completed by 1,722 (77.8%) participants. Ongoing multi-omics profiling on up to 600 patients include: genome-wide germline genotyping, paired tumor/normal whole exome sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, T cell receptor immunosequencing, and multiplex immunofluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: This consortium fills an important gap in research infrastructure in CRC as well as improving precision medicine initiatives for all individuals."
40111564,Elevated VRK1 levels after androgen deprivation therapy promote prostate cancer progression by upregulating YAP1 expression.,"PURPOSE: Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a serine-threonine kinase involved in the proliferation and migration of various cancer cells. However, its role in prostate cancer (PCa), particularly in the development of therapeutic resistance, remains unclear. METHODS: We established an androgen-independent PCa cell line derived from LNCaP prostate cancer cells and conducted transcriptome and proteome sequencing together with bioinformatic analyses of large clinical sample databases to investigate the potential role of VRK1 in PCa progression. The correlation between VRK1 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling was evaluated under simulated clinical treatment conditions. The effects of VRK1 on cell proliferation were assessed in vitro and in vivo using Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays. Additionally, proteome and transcriptome sequencing, combined with rescue experiments were performed to explore VRK1-regulated signaling pathways related to cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance. RESULTS: VRK1 expression was elevated during the progression of androgen-dependent prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer under therapeutic conditions, and high VRK1 expression was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with PCa. VRK1 was regulated by AR signaling, and its silencing suppressed PCa cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. VRK1 drove cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance in PCa by modulating yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). CONCLUSIONS: VRK1 serves as a prognostic marker in PCa, regulated by AR signaling. VRK1 depletion inhibited cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while elevated VRK1 upregulated YAP1, promoting cell proliferation and therapeutic resistance."
40111071,Spillover Effects of Medicare Advantage on Traditional Medicare Beneficiaries With Prostate Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Medicare Advantage (MA) managed care plans, now chosen by 51% of Medicare beneficiaries, are incentivized to constrain healthcare spending and utilization, a shift in financial incentives compared to Traditional Medicare's fee-for-service payment model. Beyond its primary beneficiaries, MA's mechanisms to constrain utilization may impact Traditional Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer through ""spillover"" effects on physician behavior. METHODS: From a 20% sample of Medicare claims, we identified patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2016 to 2019. We calculated MA penetration [MA beneficiaries/(Traditional Medicare and MA beneficiaries)] at the practice-level. We assessed the relationship between practice-level MA penetration and two measures of quality-potential overtreatment (i.e., treatment among those with > 75% noncancer mortality within 10 years of diagnosis) and confirmatory testing (repeat prostate biopsy, MRI, or genomic test)-using a multilevel logistic regression. We also assessed two measures of utilization, price standardized spending (i.e., global utilization) and overall treatment. RESULTS: We identified 41,092 patients. Median practice-level MA penetration was 33% (IQR 23%-43%). Increasing practice-level MA penetration was associated with increased odds of overall treatment among all Traditional Medicare beneficiaries (adjusted OR 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.05), p = 0.01, per 10% increase in MA penetration). However, MA penetration was not associated with our quality measures, potential overtreatment and confirmatory testing, or price-standardized spending. CONCLUSIONS: MA penetration at the urology practice-level varies considerably. In men with prostate cancer, greater practice-level MA penetration was associated with increased odds of treatment, but not overall utilization-even where it might influence quality."
40108436,Revealing neuroendocrine transformation in gynecological cancers through genomic analysis.,"Neuroendocrine transformation (NT) in cancers, typically observed under the selective pressure of targeted therapies, involves lineage plasticity where adenocarcinomas adopt neuroendocrine characteristics while retaining the molecular alterations of their original histology. This phenomenon, well-documented in prostate and lung cancers, has not been observed in gynecological malignancies until now. We present two pivotal cases involving primary ovarian and uterine cancers that developed neuroendocrine carcinomas post-treatment. Initially presumed to be independent primaries, comprehensive next-generation sequencing technologies, including UW-OncoPlex and BROCA panels, were used to establish a clonal relationship between the primary tumors and their respective neuroendocrine metastases. This report provides the first documented instances of NT in gynecological cancers, indicating that it may be a more widespread resistance mechanism than previously recognized. Routine re-biopsy and early integration of advanced molecular diagnostics into clinical practice will identify NT and provide insights into pathogenesis and eventual therapeutic options."
40107437,Recent update on the development of HPV16 inhibitors for cervical cancer.,"Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer (CC), which is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally. In this review, we have explained the HPV genome and the development of CC. Additionally, we summarized recently discovered small molecules that act as inhibitors of HPV-16. These molecules were identified through experimental and in-silico studies aimed at preventing or treating CC. HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the most common subtypes of HPV that cause CC globally. E6 oncoprotein of HPV-16 is considered the primary cause of CC progression. Therefore, E6 is the most focused targeted protein for developing specific and novel therapeutic inhibitors to treat HPV-related cancers. In recent years, various HPV inhibitors have been identified by means of experimental and in-silico studies. In addition, artificial intelligence-based medical diagnostic tools have grown more popular as they are capable of screening and diagnosing HPV-related cancer."
40105746,Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal a tumor-associated macrophage subpopulation that mediates prostate cancer progression and metastasis.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a transcriptionally heterogeneous population, and their abundance and function in prostate cancer is poorly defined. We integrated parallel datasets from single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence to reveal the dynamics of TAMs in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Four TAM subpopulations were identified. Notably, one of these TAM subsets was defined by the co-expression of SPP1+ and TREM2+ and was significantly enriched in metastatic tumors. The SPP1+/TREM2+ TAMs were enriched in the metastatic tumor microenvironment in both human patient samples and murine models of prostate cancer. The abundance of these SPP1+/TREM2+ macrophages was associated with patient progression free survival. Spatially, TAMs within prostate cancer bone metastases were highly enriched within the tumor region, consistent with their pro-tumorigenic role. Blocking SPP1 in RM1 prostate cancer mouse model led to improved efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment, and increased CD8 T cell infiltration in tumor. These findings suggest that targeting SPP1+ TAMs may offer a promising therapeutic strategy and potentially enhance the effects of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in advanced prostate cancer. Implications: This study expands our understanding of the diverse roles of macrophage populations in prostate cancer metastases and highlights new therapeutic targets."
40104777,Genomic prostate score and treatment selection in favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with the use of active surveillance (AS) in NCCN favourable intermediate-risk (FIR) prostate cancer (PCa) patients who received the 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) assay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Contemporary data were collected from academic and large community group practices across the United States. Eligible patients had localized PCa classified as FIR per NCCN guidelines and received a GPS report between May 2017 and April 2019. Higher GPS results (scale: 0-100) were associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. The proportion of patients selecting AS was calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Uni-and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between AS selection and relevant covariates. RESULTS: There were 324 eligible patients (Gleason Score 3 + 4, 79%; PSA 10-20 ng/ml, 19%; clinical stage T2b-T2c, 2%; median percent positive cores, 16.7%; median GPS result, 26). The distribution of GPS results was 0-19 (23%), 20-40 (60%), and 41-100 (16%). Overall, 31% (95% CI 26%, 36%) selected AS: 58% (46%, 69%) with GPS 0-19, 27% (21%, 33%) with GPS 20-40, and 6% (1%, 16%) with GPS 41-100. In univariable models, the Gleason score, percent positive cores, PSA, and GPS results were significantly associated with AS selection. In a multivariable model, the percent positive cores and the GPS result remained significantly associated with AS selection. AS persistence was 91% (82%, 95%) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The GPS result and percent positive cores appear associated with AS use after controlling for relevant clinical variables in NCCN FIR prostate cancer patients."
40104216,Unveiling racial disparities in prostate cancer using an integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis.,"Prostate cancer exhibits significant racial disparities, with African American (AA) individuals showing  approximately 64% higher incidence and 2.3 times greater mortality rates compared to their Caucasian (CA) counterparts. Understanding the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors is crucial for developing effective interventions to reduce this disproportionate burden. This study aims to uncover the genetic and transcriptomic differences driving these disparities through a comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and exome sequencing of prostate cancer tissues from both Black and White patients. Our transcriptomics analysis revealed enhanced activity in pathways linked to immune response and cellular interactions in AA prostate cancer samples, with notable regulation by histone-associated transcription factors (HIST1H1A, HIST1H1D, and HIST1H1B) suggests potential involvement of histone modification mechanisms. Additionally, pseudogenes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) among the regulated genes indicate non-coding elements' role in these disparities. Exome sequencing identified unique variants in AA patient samples within key genes, including TP73 (tumor suppression), XYLB (metabolism), ALDH4A1 (oxidative stress), PTPRB (cellular signaling), and HLA-DRB5 (immune response). These genetic variations likely contribute to disease progression and therapy response disparities. This study highlights the importance of considering genetic and epigenetic variations in developing tailored therapeutic approaches to improve treatment efficacy and reduce mortality rates across diverse populations."
40103141,Inference of transcriptional regulation from STARR-seq data.,"One of the primary regulatory processes in cells is transcription, during which RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) transcribes DNA into RNA. The binding of Pol-II to its site is regulated through interactions with transcription factors (TFs) that bind to DNA at enhancer cis-regulatory elements. Measuring the enhancer activity of large libraries of distinct DNA sequences is now possible using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), and computational methods have been developed to identify the dominant statistical patterns of TF binding within these large datasets. Such methods are global in their approach and may overlook important regulatory sites that function only within the local context. Here we introduce a method for inferring functional regulatory sites (their number, location, and width) within an enhancer sequence based on measurements of its transcriptional activity from an MPRA method such as STARR-seq. The model is based on a mean-field thermodynamic description of Pol-II binding that includes interactions with bound TFs. Our method applied to simulated STARR-seq data for a variety of enhancer architectures shows how data quality impacts the inference and also how it can find local regulatory sites that may be missed in a global approach. We also apply the method to recently measured STARR-seq data on androgen receptor (AR) bound sequences, a TF that plays an important role in the regulation of prostate cancer. The method identifies key regulatory sites within these sequences, which are found to overlap with binding sites of known coregulators of AR."
40102789,Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals CD8 + T cell heterogeneity and identifies a prognostic signature in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, immunotherapy has made significant progress. However, the understanding of the heterogeneity and function of T cells, particularly CD8 + T cells, in cervical cancer (CESC) microenvironment remains insufficient. We aim to characterize the heterogeneity, developmental trajectory, regulatory network, and intercellular communication of CD8 + T cells in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and to construct a prognostic risk model based on the transcriptomic characteristics of CD8 + T cells. METHODS: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from CESC tumor samples with bulk transcriptome data from TCGA and GEO databases. We identified CD8 + T cell subsets in the CESC microenvironment, revealing significant interactions between CD8 + T cells and other cell types through intercellular communication analysis. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic transcriptional regulation during CD8 + T cell differentiation and functional acquisition processes. We constructed a transcriptional regulatory network for CESC CD8 + T cells, identifying key transcription factors. Based on CD8 + T cell-related genes, a prognostic risk model comprising eight core genes was developed and validated using machine learning. RESULTS: We identified four distinct CD8 + T cell subsets, namely progenitor, intermediate, proliferative, and terminally differentiated, each exhibiting unique transcriptomic characteristics and functional properties. CD8 + T cell subsets interact with macrophages through different ligand-receptor networks, including the CCL-CCR signaling pathway and costimulatory molecules. Sorafenib was identified as a potential immunotherapeutic drug through drug screening. Experimental validation demonstrated that sorafenib enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells by increasing the secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, thereby significantly inhibiting the invasiveness and survival of CESC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides valuable insights into the heterogeneity and functional diversity of CD8 + T cells in CESC. We demonstrate that a CD8 + T cell-related prognostic signature may serve as a potential tool for risk stratification in patients with CESC. Additionally, our finding suggests that sorafenib could be a promising therapeutic candidate for improving antitumor immunity in this patient population."
40102673,Targeting the histone reader ZMYND8 inhibits antiandrogen-induced neuroendocrine tumor transdifferentiation of prostate cancer.,"The transdifferentiation from adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) in men confers antiandrogen therapy resistance. Here our analysis combining CRISPR‒Cas9 screening with single-cell RNA sequencing tracking of tumor transition demonstrated that antiandrogen-induced zinc finger MYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8)-dependent epigenetic programming orchestrates NEPC transdifferentiation. Ablation of Zmynd8 prevents NEPC development, while ZMYND8 upregulation mediated by achaete-scute homolog 1 promotes NEPC differentiation. We show that forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) stabilizes ZMYND8 binding to chromatin regions characterized by H3K4me1-H3K14ac modification and FOXM1 targeting. Antiandrogen therapy releases the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex from the androgen receptor, facilitating its interaction with ZMYND8-FOXM1 to upregulate critical neuroendocrine lineage regulators. We develop iZMYND8-34, a small molecule designed to inhibit ZMYND8's histone recognition, which effectively blocks NEPC development. These findings reveal the critical role of ZMYND8-dependent epigenetic programming induced by androgen deprivation therapy in orchestrating lineage fate. Targeting ZMYND8 emerges as a promising strategy for impeding NEPC development."
40100215,Clinical and Genomic Characterization of Secondary Rectal Cancer After Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.,"IMPORTANCE: Patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer (PC) have increased risk of secondary rectal cancer (SRC) and more limited treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To assess the tumor molecular profile, clinical characteristics, and oncologic outcomes of SRC after PC and compare them with those of primary rectal cancer (PRC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study included patients with SRC diagnosed 5 or more years after RT for PC and patients with PRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York between February 1, 1994, and September 31, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical information and DNA sequencing data were analyzed. Oncologic outcomes were compared between patients with SRC and clinically matched patients with PRC using log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Numerical and categorical variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS: The analysis included 604 male patients with PRC (71.6%; median age, 55 [IQR, 46-66] years) and 64 male patients with SRC (median age, 78 [IQR, 72-82] years). Patients with SRC had more distal rectum (37 of 63 [58.7%] vs 131 of 581 [22.5%]; P < .001) and anterior rectal wall (20 of 57 [35.1%] vs 67 of 496 [13.5%]; P < .001) tumors, were less likely to receive neoadjuvant treatment (33 of 64 [51.6%] vs 570 of 604 [94.4%]), and had shorter 5-year overall survival (45.7% vs 64.9%; P = .01) and disease-free survival (40.3% vs 71.2%; P = .006) compared with clinically matched patients with PRC. Targeted DNA sequencing data from 31 SRC tumors identified lower mutational burden (median, 4.4 [IQR, 3.2-6.7] per megabase [Mb] vs 5.8 [IQR, 4.4-7.0] per Mb; P = .047), lower frequency of APC alterations (15 [48.4%] vs 432 [79.9%]; P < .001), and higher rates of SMAD4 inactivation (8 [25.8%] vs 54 [10.0%]; P = .01) compared with 541 PRC tumors. Whole-exome sequencing data from 17 SRC tumors identified a higher rate of frameshift deletions compared with 28 PRC tumors (median, 5.0 [IQR, 4.0-9.0] vs 2.5 [IQR, 1.0-4.2] variants; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case-control study, patients with SRC after RT for PC had worse survival and different molecular profiles than patients with PRC. These findings may help improve the clinical management of SRC."
40099576,C1QBP Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression and Lipid Accumulation by Negatively Regulating ALDH9A1.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) relies heavily on lipid metabolism for energy acquisition, and lipid metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in its progression. Here, we utilized publicly available PCa databases and immunohistochemistry to evaluate C1QBP expression in PCa. We found that C1QBP is highly expressed in PCa, potentially due to promoter hypomethylation. Functional assays showed that C1QBP promotes cell proliferation, migration, and lipid accumulation in PCa cells. We identified differentially expressed proteins associated with C1QBP by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that C1QBP affects lipid metabolism and negatively regulates the lipid metabolism-related molecule ALDH9A1. Furthermore, ALDH9A1 intervention rescued the tumor suppression and lipid reduction caused by C1QBP knockdown. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to explore C1QBP regulatory pathways at the mRNA level, revealing that C1QBP also affects the MAPK and p53 pathways, as well as the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules. In conclusion, these findings suggest that C1QBP influences PCa progression and lipid deposition by regulating ALDH9A1, while other potential mechanisms may also be involved, indicating that C1QBP is a promising target for PCa treatment."
40098725,Nonshrinkable Thermosensitive Hydrogels Combined with Bispecific Anti-PSMA/CD3 T-Cell Engager for Effective Against Tumors in Mice Model.,"PURPOSE: CD3-based Bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are effective for solid tumors due to their tumor specificity and tissue penetration, but they face challenges like short half-lives and narrow therapeutic windows. Innovative delivery systems, like thermosensitive hydrogels, show the potential to enhance stability, sustained release, and therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: We developed PEGylated PLGA (PEG-PLGA) thermosensitive hydrogels with a nonshrinkable property (nsTPPgels) for effective controlled release and loaded them with bispecific anti-prostate surface membrane antigen (PSMA) F(ab) /anti-CD3 (sc)F(v) T-cell engager (BiPTE) to form in situ drug deposits with a sustained-release profile after subcutaneous injection. Each group of hydrogels was first tested for differences in properties through rheological and in vitro drug release profiles. Meanwhile, in vivo pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor efficacy studies, and T-cell tracking studies were conducted to analyze the advantages of nsTPPgels included D(2)gel and DTgels. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of BiPTE against PSMA-overexpressing tumor cells and the drug release functionality of nsTPPgels were validated in vitro. Rheological studies showed that both D(2)gel and DTgels remained in solution below 27  degrees C for easy injection and solidified at physiological temperatures to form localized depots for sustained BiPTE release. All nsTPPgels demonstrated a 5-day in vitro sustained release, prolonged elimination half-life, steady plasma BiPTE levels, and extended mean residence time. In an LNCaP-xenograft mouse model, tumor growth inhibition rates for BiPTE/DTgel-2, BiPTE/DTgel-2S, and BiPTE/D2gel were 74.3%, 96.1%, and 113.1%, respectively, compared to 35.6% for intravenous and 46% for subcutaneous BiPTE administration. Furthermore, all nsTPPgels effectively achieved T-cell recruitment to lymph nodes and tumor sites in tracking studies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we developed relatively convenient injectable thermosensitive D(2)gel with a desirable gelation temperature window, which have the potential to be used for antibody drug delivery in several biomedical applications."
40093571,Prognostic Value of Ferroptosis-Immunity-Related Signature Genes in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy Resistance and Risk Modeling.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to clarify the genome of ferroptosis in the genes involved in radiotherapy resistance and regulation of tumor immune microenvironment by multigene analysis of cervical cancer (CC) patients. METHODS: Different radiation sensitivity samples from CC patients were collected for RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the RNA dataset and the GSE9750 dataset were considered as radiotherapy-DEGs. The intersection genes of radiotherapy-DEGs with ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and the intersection genes of radiotherapy-DEGs with immune-related genes (IRGs) were labeled as FRGs-IRGs-DEGs (FIGs). A risk model was established by prognostic genes selected from FIGs by univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. The results were further validated using samples from CC tissue samples. RESULTS: The 329 DEGs related to CC radiotherapy were identified. LSAAO analysis was utilized to identify five prognostic genes (CALCRL, UCHL1, GNRH1, ACVRL1, and MUC1) from six candidate prognosis genes and construct a risk model. The risk model demonstrated favorable effectiveness in predicting outcomes at 1, 3, and 5 years, as evidenced by ROC curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that CALCRL, GNRH1, and MUC1 were independent prognostic factors. The results of functional similarity analysis showed that CALCRL, UCHL1, ACVRL1 and MUC1 had high average functional similarity. The results of PCR and IHC showed the same trend with the results above. DISCUSSION: A novel prognostic model related to ferroptosis and immune microenvironment in CC radiotherapy was developed and validated, providing valuable guidance for personalized anti-cancer therapy."
40091081,"A comparative analysis of somatic mutational profiles according to HIV status among women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3): a focus on hotspots in TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, and EGFR.","BACKGROUND: Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in HIV treatment, cervical cancer remains a leading malignancy in HIV-infected women. Additionally, co-infection by HIV and HPV further accelerates cervical cancer development. There are limited studies on the role of host somatic variations in HIV infected and HIV-negative women with cervical cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate and compare host somatic genetic variation in cervical biopsies obtained from HIV infected and HIV-negative women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 to understand the genomic landscape. The distribution of HPV types was also investigated between HIV infected and HIV-negative women. METHODS: The project used an age-matched case-control study utilizing archived cervical biopsies from 88 women (44 HIV infected, 44 HIV-negative) attending Groote Schuur Hospital Cancer Clinic between 2020 and 2022. HPV infection and type were confirmed using the Anyplex II HPV28 Detection kit. Six hotspot regions in the four commonly mutated genes (TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, and EGFR) in cervical cancer were genotyped using PCR and Sanger Sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was assessed using SIFT, Polyphen-2, and ClinVar tools. RESULTS: The median age was 37 years (IQR: 34-41) for HIV infected women and 35 years (IQR:32- 43) for HIV-negative women. Significantly more HIV-negative women (51% vs. 12%) reported tobacco smoking (p < 0.0001), menstruation irregularities (74% vs. 35%; p = 0.005), and contraception usage (77% vs. 59%; p = 0.019), when compared to their HIV-infected counterparts. Common HPV types identified were HPV16 (n = 43/88, 49%), HPV35 (n = 12/88, 14%), and HPV58 (n = 10/88, 11%). A total of 232 genetic variants were reported. HIV infected women had a significantly higher (p = 0.0406) burden of pathogenic variants (31%) compared to the HIV-negative (15%). The spectrum of observed mutations included stop-gain, missense, synonymous, and intronic changes. Most of the stop gain mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were reported among HIV infected women (n = 4/5), compared to HIV-negative women (n = 1/5). Damaging variants were more prevalent in women under 50 in both cohorts. We also report on rare HPV subtypes currently not included in the diagnostic HPV test kits in this cohort (HPV 82, 42, 43 and 53). CONCLUSION: HIV-infection status and age appear to be risk factors for higher burden of pathogenic mutations in genes that predispose to cervical cancer. Mutation profiles in PIK3CA and TP53 genes could be biomarkers of cervical cancer progression but more studies are needed."
40090465,Single-Cell Proteomic Characterization of Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Reveals Molecular Signatures Associated with Morphological Changes.,"This study delves into the proteomic intricacies of drug-resistant cells (DRCs) within prostate cancer, which are known for their pivotal roles in therapeutic resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Utilizing single-cell proteomics (SCP) with an optimized high-throughput Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) approach with the throughput of 60 sample per day, we characterized the proteomic landscape of DRCs in comparison to parental PC3 cells. This DIA method allowed for robust and reproducible protein quantification at the single-cell level, enabling the identification and quantification of over 1,300 proteins per cell on average. Distinct proteomic sub-clusters within the DRC population were identified, closely linked to variations in cell size. The study uncovered novel protein signatures, including the regulation of proteins critical for cell adhesion and metabolic processes, as well as the upregulation of surface proteins and transcription factors pivotal for cancer progression. Furthermore, by conducting single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis, we identified six upregulated and ten downregulated genes consistently altered in drug-treated cells across both SCP and scRNA-seq platforms. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of DRCs and their unique molecular signatures, providing valuable insights into their biological behavior and potential therapeutic targets."
40089067,Metabolic Reprogramming into a Glycolysis Phenotype Induced by Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Most cancer cells adopt a less efficient metabolic process of aerobic glycolysis with high level of glucose uptake followed by lactic acid production, known as the Warburg effect. This phenotypic transition enables cancer cells to achieve increased cellular survival and proliferation in a harsh low-oxygen tumor microenvironment. Also, the resulting acidic microenvironment causes inactivation of the immune system such as T-cell impairment that favors escape by immune surveillance. While lots of studies have revealed that tumor-derived EVs can deliver parental materials to adjacent cells and contribute to oncogenic reprogramming, their functionality in energy metabolism is not well addressed. In this study, we established prostate cancer cells PC3-AcT resistant to cellular death in an acidic culture medium driven by lactic acid. Quantitative proteomics between EVs derived from PC-3 and PC-3AcT cells identified 935 confident EV proteins. According to cellular adaptation to lactic acidosis, we revealed 159 regulated EV proteins related to energy metabolism, cellular shape, and extracellular matrix. These EVs contained a high abundance of glycolytic enzymes. In particular, PC-3AcT EVs were enriched with apolipoproteins including apolipoprotein B100 (APOB). APOB on PC-3AcT EVs could facilitate their endocytic uptake depending on low density lipoprotein receptor of recipient PC-3 cells, encouraging increases of cellular proliferation and survival in acidic culture media via increased activity and expression of hexokinases and phosphofructokinase. The activation of recipient PC-3 cells can increase glucose consumption and ATP generation, representing an acquired metabolic reprogramming into the Warburg phenotype. Our study first revealed that EVs derived from prostate cancer cells could contribute to energy metabolic reprogramming and that the acquired metabolic phenotypic transition of recipient cells could favor cellular survival in tumor microenvironment."
40088685,Gracilaria edulis-mediated silver nanoparticles as a targeted strategy for cervical cancer with integrated toxicity evaluation in zebrafish.,"Cervical cancer remains a critical global health concern, demanding the development of innovative therapies to address the limitations of conventional chemotherapeutics, including systemic toxicity and lack of specificity. Silver nanoparticles synthesized using Gracilaria edulis (GE-AgNPs) present a novel therapeutic strategy, exhibiting selective cytotoxicity against the HEK293 normal epithelial cell line and HeLa cervical cancer cell line. Phytochemical analysis of Gracilaria edulis identified bioactive compounds such as 4-Benzaldehyde and 1H-1,3-Benzimidazole-1-acetonitrile, both associated with potent anticancer activities. Comprehensive characterization of GE-AgNPs through spectroscopy and microscopy revealed distinctive physicochemical properties, including an absorption peak at 332 nm and a hexagonal crystalline structure. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that GE-AgNPs induce apoptosis in HeLa cells exhibit a concentration-dependent response, with an IC(50) value of 54.05 mug/mL, while GE-AgNPs exhibited no significant toxicity to HEK293 cells at the tested concentrations, as evidenced by a higher IC(50) value of 83.6 mug/mL. The pro-apoptotic effect was mediated through the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS), validated using dual staining and Hoechst assays, which demonstrated chromatin condensation indicative of apoptosis. Molecular analysis further elucidated the mechanism of action, highlighting significant inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This was evidenced by downregulation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR genes alongside the upregulation of PTEN, a critical tumor suppressor. Zebrafish embryo toxicity assays provided insights into the biocompatibility of GE-AgNPs, revealing low toxicity at therapeutic concentrations but developmental abnormalities and neurotoxicity at higher doses. These findings underscore the promise of GE-AgNPs as a targeted therapy option for cervical cancer, effectively modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway while maintaining manageable toxicity profiles. Further investigations into optimizing dosing regimens and exploring synergistic effects with existing treatments could enhance their clinical applicability."
40088361,Pan-cancer analysis predicts MBOAT2 as a potential new ferroptosis related gene immune checkpoint.,"BACKGROUND: The phospholipid-modifying enzyme MBOAT2 plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis by inhibiting iron sequestration, thus preventing iron-induced cell death. It achieves this by remodeling the phospholipid composition of cell membranes through phospholipid metabolism. Although multiple studies have highlighted the significance of MBOAT2 in tumorigenesis, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis has not been conducted to date. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of MBOAT2 using RNA sequencing data from the TCGA and GTEx databases. We also investigated MBOAT2 protein information using resources such as the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), GeneCards, and String databases. To assess the prognostic value of MBOAT2, we conducted survival analysis based on clinical data from TCGA. Additionally, we performed enrichment analysis using the R package ""clusterProfiler"" and explored the relationship between MBOAT2 expression and immune cell infiltration, as well as immune checkpoint interactions in TCGA datasets. Furthermore, we examined the correlation between MBOAT2 expression and clinical pathology through immunohistochemical analysis of breast, prostate, lung, and liver cancer tissues in the HPA database. Finally, western blotting was used to validate MBOAT2 protein expression in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that MBOAT2 was highly expressed in a wide range of cancer types, with its expression correlating with improved survival outcomes in the TCGA dataset. Moreover, we found a significant association between MBOAT2 expression and immune regulation, particularly in relation to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint interactions. CONCLUSION: MBOAT2 holds promise as a prognostic biomarker and may serve as a target for immunotherapy in various malignancies. Further investigation into its role in cancer immunity could offer new insights into potential therapeutic strategies."
40087774,Atractylenolide I ameliorated the growth and enzalutamide resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting KIF15.,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has been a major cause of tumor-associated death among men worldwide. The discovery of novel therapeutic medicines for CRPC remains imperative. Atractylenolide I (ATR-I), a prominent bioactive component from Atractylodes macrocephala, exhibits powerful anticancer potentials in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the ATR-I's activity on CRPC has not been reported. METHODS: An enzalutamide-resistant (EnzR) cell line was successfully constructed. CCK-8, EdU, wound healing, Transwell assays, flow cytometry, and xenograft tumor models were applied to investigate the antitumor activity of ATR-I against CRPC. The changes in the gene expression profiles after ATR-I treatment were analyzed using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: ATR-I suppressed the proliferative and migratory abilities of AR(+) and AR(-) CRPC cells, while triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. ATR-I also exerted anti-cancer activity on EnzR cell lines. Intriguingly, a combination of ATR-I with enzalutamide synergistically induced more apoptosis of tumor cells. RNA-sequencing identified kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) as a potential target of ATR-I. KIF15 was up-regulated in prostate cancer (PCa), and its higher level was associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Further investigation showed that ATR-I mediated ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of AR/AR-V7 through targeting KIF15, resulting in CRPC repression. Finally, our in vivo experiment verified that ATR-I alone or in combination with enzalutamide retarded the growth of EnzR xenograft tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identified ATR-I as a promising therapeutic drug for overcoming enzalutamide resistance in CRPC patients and increased our understanding about its antitumor mechanisms."
40087745,Proteogenomic characterization of molecular and cellular targets for treatment-resistant subtypes in locally advanced cervical cancers.,"We report proteogenomic analysis of locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Exome-seq data revealed predominant alterations of keratinization-TP53 regulation and O-glycosylation-TP53 regulation axes in squamous and adeno-LACC, respectively, compared to in early-stage cervical cancer. Integrated clustering of mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation data identified six subtypes (Sub1-6) of LACC among which Sub3, 5, and 6 showed the treatment-resistant nature with poor local recurrence-free survival. Elevated immune and extracellular matrix (ECM) activation mediated by activated stroma (PDGFD and CXCL1(high) fibroblasts) characterized the immune-hot Sub3 enriched with MUC5AC(high) epithelial cells (ECs). Increased epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and ECM remodeling characterized the immune-cold squamous Sub5 enriched with PGK1 and CXCL10(high) ECs. We further demonstrated that CIC mutations could trigger EMT activation by upregulating ETV4, and the elevation of the immune checkpoint PVR and neutrophil-like myeloid-derived suppressive cells (FCN1 and FCGR3B(high) macrophages) could cause suppression of T-cell activation in Sub5. Increased O-linked glycosylation of mucin characterized adeno-LACC Sub6 enriched with MUC5AC(high) ECs. These results provide a battery of somatic mutations, cellular pathways, and cellular players that can be used to predict treatment-resistant LACC subtypes and can serve as potential therapeutic targets for these LACC subtypes."
40084488,Cell-free DNA aneuploidy score as a dynamic early response marker in prostate cancer.,"Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for response evaluation in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The current study evaluated the modified fast aneuploidy screening test-sequencing system (mFast-SeqS), a quick, tumor-agnostic and affordable ctDNA assay that requires a small input of DNA, to generate a genome-wide aneuploidy (GWA) score in mCRPC patients, and correlated this to matched metastatic tumor biopsies. In this prospective multicenter study, GWA scores were evaluated from blood samples of 196 mCRPC patients prior to treatment (baseline) with taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI; abiraterone and enzalutamide), and from 74 mCRPC patients at an early timepoint during treatment (early timepoint; median 21 days). Z-scores per chromosome arm were tested for their association with tumor tissue genomic alterations. We found that a high tumor load in blood (GWA(high)) at baseline was associated with poor response to ARSI [HR: 2.63 (95% CI: 1.86-3.72) P < 0.001] but not to taxanes. Interestingly, GWA(high) score at the early timepoint was associated with poor response to both ARSIs [HR: 6.73 (95% CI: 2.60-17.42) P < 0.001] and taxanes [2.79 (95% CI: 1.34-5.78) P = 0.006]. A significant interaction in Cox proportional hazards analyses was seen when combining GWA status and type of treatment (at baseline P = 0.008; early timepoint P = 0.018). In summary, detection of ctDNA in blood by mFast-SeqS is cheap, fast and feasible, and could be used at different timepoints as a potential predictor for outcome to ARSI and taxane treatment in mCRPC."
40084251,Genetic variants of IGF2BP2 as potential predictors for perineural invasion of prostate cancer in a Taiwanese population.,"Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), which binds with high affinity to numerous RNA transcripts, is known to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis, including in prostate cancer (PCa). Several case-control studies investigated associations between IGF2BP2 polymorphisms and cancer progression. However, the effects of IGF2BP2 genetic variants on clinicopathological progression and biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa remain unclear. In this study, we recruited 698 Taiwanese PCa patients who underwent a radical prostatectomy to investigate associations of IGF2BP2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of BCR and clinicopathological progression. Using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, we genotyped three IGF2BP2 SNPs located in the second intron: rs11705701 (G/A), rs4402960 (G/T), and rs1470579 (A/C). Our findings revealed that these IGF2BP2 SNPs had no significant effect on initial prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) levels or postoperative BCR. However, patients with the rs1470579 A/C genotype exhibited a higher risk of developing perineural invasion (PNI) compared to those with the homozygous A/A genotype. This association was particularly pronounced in patients with an elevated iPSA level (>10 ng/mL). Clinical observations from The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed that elevated IGF2BP2 levels in PCa tissues were significantly associated with higher Gleason scores and exhibited a trend toward correlating with tumor metastasis. In conclusion, our findings highlight that the IGF2BP2 rs1470579 A>C polymorphism may increase susceptibility for PNI among PCa patients in the Taiwanese population."
40082876,Single-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal heterogeneity and key subsets associated with survival and response to PD-1 blockade in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the intricate tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the progression of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and its response to anti-PD-1 therapy. METHODS: In this study, we characterized 50,649 cells obtained from the CSCC for single-cell RNA sequencing and integrated bulk sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and clinical samples to explore their cell composition, metabolic processes, signaling pathways, specific transcription factors, lineage tracking and response to immunotherapy. In vivo experiments were performed to validate the function of key cell subsets. RESULTS: We identified ten major cell type and 35 subsets of stromal and immune cells in TME and observed distinct patterns in the metabolic processes and signaling pathways of these cells between tumor and normal tissues. Furthermore, PCNA clamp-associated factor (PCLAF)(+) tumor-associated epithelial cell (TAEpis) was negatively correlated with the number of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13)(+) CD8(+) T cells, overall survival, and response to anti-programmed cell death-1(PD-1) therapy in patients with CSCC. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that PCLAF(+) TAEpis promotes the apoptosis of CD8(+) T and tumor growth, while also inhibiting T cell infiltration and function. CONCLUSION: Our findings illuminate the heterogeneity of the complex TME in CSCC and offer evidence supporting PCLAF(+) TAEpis as a promising therapeutic target."
40082405,Enhancer transcription profiling reveals an enhancer RNA-driven ferroptosis and new therapeutic opportunities in prostate cancer.,"Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a subclass of non-coding RNAs transcribed from enhancer regions, have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression; however, their functional roles in prostate cancer remain largely unexplored. In this study, we performed integrated chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic analyses using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on twenty pairs of prostate cancer and matched benign tissues. By incorporating chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data, we identified a subset of differentially expressed eRNAs significantly associated with genes involved in prostate development and oncogenic signaling pathways. Among these, lactotransferrin-eRNA (LTFe) was markedly downregulated in prostate cancer tissues, with functional analyses revealing its tumor-suppressive role. Mechanistically, LTFe promotes the transcription of its target gene, lactotransferrin (LTF), by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (HNRNPF) and facilitating enhancer-promoter chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LTFe-LTF axis facilitates ferroptosis by modulating iron transport. Notably, androgen receptor (AR) signaling disrupts LTFe-associated chromatin looping, leading to ferroptosis resistance. Therapeutically, co- administration of the AR inhibitor enzalutamide and the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 significantly suppressed tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the mechanistic role of eRNAs in prostate cancer, highlighting the LTFe-LTF axis as a critical epigenetic regulator and potential therapeutic target for improved treatment outcomes."
40082276,Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed changes in the tumor microenvironment induced by radiotherapy for cervical cancer and the molecular mechanism of mast cells in immunosuppression.,"Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment for cervical cancer (CC), effectively controlling tumor growth and improving survival rates. However, radiotherapy-induced cell heterogeneity and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which may potentially impact treatment efficacy. This study aims to investigate tumor microenvironment changes following radiotherapy for CC, hoping to provide evidence to improve the therapeutic effects of radiotherapy. For the first time, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze tissue samples from three CC patients pre- and post-radiotherapy. We obtained gene expression data from 52,506 cells to identify the cellular changes and molecular mechanisms induced by radiotherapy. Radiotherapy significantly alters cellular composition and gene expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably upregulating mast cell expression. Mast cells are involved in multiple cell axes in the CC ecosystem after radiotherapy, and play a pivotal role in tumor immunosuppression and matrix remodeling. scRNA-seq revealed gene expression variations among cell types after radiotherapy, underscoring the importance of specific cell types in modulating the TME post-treatment. This study revealed the molecular mechanism of radiotherapy for CC and the role of mast cells, providing a foundation for optimizing the personalized treatment of CC."
40081549,Role of lncRNA PVT1 in the progression of urological cancers: Novel insights into signaling pathways and clinical opportunities.,"Urologic malignancies, encompassing cancers of the kidney, bladder, and prostate, represent approximately 25 % of all cancer cases. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of PVT1's crucial functions. Long noncoding RNAs influence both the onset and development of cancer, as well as epigenetic alterations. Recent findings have focused on PVT1's mechanism of action across several malignancies, particularly urologic cancers. Understanding the various functions of PVT1 linked to cancer is necessary for the development of cancer detection and treatment when PVT1 is dysregulated. Furthermore, recent advancements in genomic and epigenetic research have elucidated the complex regulatory networks that control PVT1 expression. Comprehending the intricate role of PVT1 Understanding the complex function of PVT1 in urologic cancers has substantial clinical implications. Here, we summarize some of the most recent findings about the carcinogenic effects of PVT1 signaling pathways and the possible treatment strategies for urological malignancies that target these pathways."
40081210,Machine learning prediction of overall survival in prostate adenocarcinoma using ensemble techniques.,"Prostate adenocarcinoma (PAC) is a complex and common cancer in males and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death globally. PAC is a multifaceted disease that encompasses different subtypes, including acinar and ductal adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and transitional cell carcinoma with each subtype presenting distinct prognostic difficulties. Therefore, predicting the overall survival (OS) rate of individuals with PAC continues to be a substantial clinical barrier due to the diverse nature of the illness, coexisting medical conditions, and constraints associated with conventional diagnostic markers. As a result, we focus on using ensemble machine learning (ML) models to predict the OS of PAC patients. We evaluated these eight (8) ensemble ML models: Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), LightGBM (LGBM), CatBoost, Hard Voting Classifier (HVC), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), using the data set obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer Atlas. The ensemble ML models were evaluated using essential performance indicators, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, and ROC AUC score. The results show that GB outperformed other models by obtaining a perfect score of 1.0 in accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score, and 0.99 as ROC AUC. Similarly, RF and AdaBoost exhibited robust efficiency, suggesting their potential in healthcare settings for predicting PAC survival. In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of ensemble techniques in improving prediction precision and underscores the need for further research in clinical settings."
40080446,Discovery of YJZ5118: A Potent and Highly Selective Irreversible CDK12/13 Inhibitor with Synergistic Effects in Combination with Akt Inhibition.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and other human cancers. Despite the development of several CDK12/13 inhibitors, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance of potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we report the discovery of YJZ5118, a novel, potent and highly selective covalent inhibitor of CDK12/13 with reasonable pharmacokinetic profiles. YJZ5118 effectively inhibited CDK12 and CDK13 with IC(50) values of 39.5 and 26.4 nM, respectively, while demonstrating high selectivity over other CDKs. Mass spectrometry analysis, cocrystal structure determination, and pulldown-proteomic experiments confirmed the compound's covalent binding mode with CDK12/13. Functionally, YJZ5118 efficiently suppressed the transcription of DNA damage response genes, induced DNA damage, and triggered apoptosis. Moreover, the compound significantly inhibited the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines, particularly prostate cancer cells. Notably, YJZ5118 exhibited synergistic effects with Akt inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo."

The most frequently studied cancers in relation to vitamin D were breast, colorectal, prostate, skin, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular, thyroid, leukemia, multiple myeloma, bladder, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, cervical, endometrial, and glioblastoma, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed key patterns related to vitamin D: Calcitriol's chemopreventive role in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, dietary vitamin D for its involvement in ovarian cancer, vitamin D for regulation of cancer-related hypercalcemia, vitamin D deficiency links to inflammation-obesity-cancer risk, VDR polymorphisms affecting outcomes in lung and colorectal cancers, and vitamin D's photoprotective effects on skin malignancies, and vitamin D in ulcerative colitis-related cancer. The most cited articles emphasized optimal vitamin D levels and cancer prevention. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the extensive research on vitamin D and its complex links to cancer, emphasizing future prospects with a focus on precision medicine approaches, including targeted supplementation and genomic analyses, to better address individual variability in cancer prevention and treatment."
40078560,Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptomes uncovers clinically relevant molecular subtypes in human prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disease characterized by diverse cellular ecosystems within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and high tumor heterogeneity, which challenges clinically stratified management and reinforces the need for novel strategies to fight against castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 10 untreated primary PCa tissues and integrated public scRNA-seq resources from three normal prostate tissues, two untreated primary PCa tissues, and six CRPC tumors to portray a comprehensive cellular and molecular interaction atlas of PCa. We further integrated the single-cell and bulk transcriptomes of PCa to establish a molecular classification system. RESULTS: scRNA-seq profiles revealed substantial inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity across different cell subpopulations in untreated PCa and CRPC tumors. In the malignant epithelial reservoir, cells evolved along decoupled paths in treatment-naive PCa and CRPC tumors, and distinct transcriptional reprogramming processes were activated, highlighting anti-androgen therapy-induced lineage plasticity. Based on the specifically expressed markers of the epithelial subpopulations, we conducted unsupervised clustering analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) cohort and identified three molecularly and clinically distinct subtypes. The C1 subtype, characterized by high enrichment of CRPC-enriched epithelial cells, had a high risk of rapid development of anti-androgen resistance and might require active surveillance and additional promising intervention treatments, such as integrin A3 (ITGA3) + integrin B1 (ITGB1) inhibition. The C2 subtype resembled the immune-modulated subtype that was most likely to benefit from anti-LAG3 immunotherapy. The C3 subtype had a favorable prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive and high-resolution landscape of the intricate architecture of the PCa TME, and our trichotomic molecular taxonomy could help facilitate precision oncology."
40076860,In Vitro and In Silico Cytotoxic Activity of Isocordoin from Adesmia balsamica Against Cancer Cells.,"This study investigates the anticancer potential of isocordoin, a prenylated chalcone found in Adesmia balsamica. In vitro assays on colorectal (HT-29), breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines, together with a non-cancerous colon cell line (CoN CCD841), revealed that isocordoin is cytotoxic, with PC-3 and MCF-7 cells showing the highest sensitivity. The selectivity index was higher for PC-3 (5.2) than for MCF-7 (3.7) and HT-29 (2.9). Isocordoin induced morphological changes suggestive of apoptosis in tumor cells. Mechanistic studies on HT-29 and MCF-7 lines indicated that isocordoin might possess antioxidant properties while promoting the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspases activation. Molecular docking showed a favorable interaction of isocordoin with caspase-3, which could explain its apoptotic effects. In silico predictions suggest that isocordoin has drug-like properties, including good absorption and permeability to the blood-brain barrier. The presence of the prenyl chain in isocordoin appears crucial for cytotoxic activity, supported by its higher lipophilicity and better interaction with caspase-3 compared to non-prenylated 2',4'-dihydroxychalcone. Overall, isocordoin demonstrates promising anticancer activity, warranting further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent."
40076501,Identification of Thyroid Genes Whose Expression Is Altered by Neonatal Irradiation in Rats.,"Childhood radiation is a risk factor for thyroid cancer that became well known after the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident. Although these human cases have been extensively studied, the mechanisms underlying childhood susceptibility to radiation-induced thyroid cancer have yet to be explained. Our previous study showed that neonatal X-irradiation resulted in long-term alterations in the mRNA expression of thyroid cancer-related marker genes, which may be a critical mechanism for understanding the higher radiation sensitivity in young patients. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based gene expression analysis was employed to identify thyroid genes whose mRNA expression was changed by neonatal irradiation. Male Wistar rats aged 1 week and 4 months were subjected to cervical X-irradiation at 4 Gy. After 8 weeks, total RNA was extracted from the thyroid and subjected to RNA-Seq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes following irradiation. We identified five upregulated genes (i.e., Adm2, Vnn1, Snph, Gria3, and Cpa4) and one downregulated gene (i.e., Crtac1) explicitly altered by neonatal radiation exposure. Western blotting confirmed the corresponding changes in CPA4 and CRTAC1 expression. The gene expressions identified were also altered in thyroid tumors induced by an iodine-deficient diet. These long-term changes in thyroid gene expression caused by neonatal irradiation may be involved in the increased risk of thyroid carcinogenesis."
40075854,Non-DRE Voided Urine Test to Diagnose Prostate Cancer: Updated Results.,"Background: The standard diagnostic approach for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis consists of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, digital rectal examination (DRE) and image-guided targeted biopsies. Given the invasive nature, potential adverse events and costs associated with these techniques, alternative approaches have been investigated, specifically with serum and urine assays. The work presented here is intended to further validate a novel noninvasive optical technique for PCa detection, targeting the VPAC genomic receptors that are overexpressed on prostate cancer's malignant cells (MC), in non-DRE voided urine. Methods: Patients (N = 62) who had image-guided biopsy and histologically confirmed localized PCa, and who were scheduled for radical prostatectomy, provided a non-DRE voided urine sample prior to surgery. Urine was cytocentrifuged and cells fixed on a glass slide, incubated with 0.5 mug TP4303 (a receptor-specific fluorophore developed in our laboratory with high affinity for VPAC), excess washed and treated with 4,6-diamidodino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. The field of cells on each slide was analyzed using a Zeiss AX10 Observer microscope (20x). The total number of cells and MC were then counted, and the florescent intensity around each MC was measured using Zeiss software. Additionally, non-DRE voided urine samples collected from clinically determined BPH patients (N = 97), were also analyzed similarly. Results: Urine samples from 62 patients were processed and analyzed. Mean PSA levels by Gleason grade (GG) group were 6.5 +/- 4.1 ng/mL for GG1 (N = 10), 7.2 +/- 3.8 for GG2 (N = 31), 13.2 +/- 14.6 for GG3 (N = 13), 6.2 +/- 2.2 for GG4 (N = 2) and 50.2 +/- 104.9 for GG5 (N = 6). Like the PSA, % MC shed (66.7 +/- 27.7) in voided urine and the fluorescent intensity (35.8 +/- 5.7) were highest in patients with GG5 prostate cancer. All PCa patients in GG1 to GG5 shed MC in voided urine with increasing % of MC and increasing fluorescence intensity which correlated with the increasing GG for PCa. For BPH, the specificity for the assay was 89.6% (95% CI:81.9-94.9%), PPV was 0.0% and NPV was 100% (95.9% CI, 95.9-100%). Conclusions: These data indicate the following: (i) PCa MC shed in non-DRE voided urine can be detected by targeting VPAC receptors, (ii) MC are shed in non-DRE voided urine with increasing quantity, corresponding to the severity of the disease, and (iii) this non-DRE voided urine optical assay provides a simple, noninvasive, and reliable method for the preliminary detection of PCa with potentially a lower cost than the currently available pre-biopsy detection technologies."
40075623,"Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibition in Prostate Cancer: Past, Present, and Future.","BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress, prostate cancer remains a leading cause of death. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors, which are already approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, are undergoing extensive testing as monotherapy and in various combinations as a potentially valuable treatment modality in prostate cancer patients. Thus far, a limited number of these studies have published results, which have been largely disappointing. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we describe the biologic rationale for the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in prostate cancer, the existing clinical data describing their use in prostate cancer, and ongoing clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors as monotherapy and in combination for the treatment of prostate cancer. In particular, we focus on possible resistance mechanisms that may be particularly relevant in prostate cancer patients, leading to de novo and acquired resistance, and we highlight novel strategies that can overcome this resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical trials are actively working to (1) refine the role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in prostate cancer patients; (2) develop new inhibitors of other cell-cycle targets, such as CDK2 and CDK7; and (3) explore novel combination therapies with inhibitors of other relevant pathways, such as PI3K or MAPK. Further genomic subtyping of advanced prostate cancer will likely shed light on the subsets of patients most likely to benefit from cell-cycle-targeted agents."
40075569,Secretome Analysis of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Reveals Cell Cycle-Dependent PSA Secretion and Potential Biomarkers.,"Background: Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is marked by heterogeneity and therapy resistance, which arise from prolonged therapy regimens. This heterogeneity is reflected in various morphologic and genetic characteristics, biomarker expression, and other molecular mechanisms, thereby contributing to the complexity of the disease. Methods: To investigate tumor heterogeneity, the effects of androgen targeting therapy (ADT) on single-cell PSA secretion was assessed by analyzing the prostate cancer cell lines using a modified ELISpot platform. The FACS and cytospin techniques were employed to understand the influence of the cell cycle on PSA secretion patterns. Additionally, a proteome array was used to identify potential biomarkers from different PCa cell lines with varying metastatic potential. Results: Among the various PCa cell lines examined, PSA expression and secretion could be visualized only from the LNCaPs. PSA secretion from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) further confirmed the validity of this assay. These LNCaPs exhibited heterogeneity in single-cell intracellular and extracellular PSA expression and in their ADT responses. LNCaPs in the G1 phase showed higher PSA secretion than in the S or G2/M phase. Apart from PSA, Cathepsin D, Progranulin, IL-8, Serpin E1, and Enolase 2 were identified as secretome markers from the metastatic PCa cell lines. Conclusions: We observed variability in PSA secretion in LNCaP in response to anti-androgen treatment and a cell cycle-dependent secretion pattern. The notable presence of Progranulin and Cathepsin D in metastatic cell lines makes them promising candidates for use in multiplexing and single-cell platforms, potentially advancing our understanding and treatment of this disease."
40075453,Identification of TAP2 as a novel immune target in human cancers: insights from integrated bioinformatics and experimental approaches.,"BACKGROUND: Transporter 2, ATP binding cassette (ABC) subfamily B member (TAP2), encodes a protein within the ABC transporter superfamily. TAP2 plays a role in the progression of cancers, such as cervical, breast, and lung cancers. However, the relationship between TAP2 and cancer prognosis, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment, and immunotherapy remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of TAP2 expression on its role in predicting tumor prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, single-cell, and Connectivity Map analyses were used to comprehensively assess TAP2-related genomic alterations, prognostic value, enrichment pathways, single-cell expression patterns, and potential targeting inhibitors. In addition, molecular docking techniques were used to simulate drug binding to TAP2. WB and RT-qPCR were used to detect differences in TAP2 expression in glioma cell lines. The U251MG cell line was established with TAP2 overexpression. The effects of elevated TAP2 expression on GBM cell function was evaluated using various assays, including the Transwell migration, scratch, and clonal formation assays. RESULTS: TAP2 exhibited aberrantly expression in tumor tissues with genomic alterations. TAP2 significantly correlates with poor prognosis across various cancers. It was also involved in immune-related pathways, immune infiltration, and immune checkpoint regulation, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response to cancer. TAP2 was identified as a potential predictor of immunotherapy response and screened for potential targeted inhibitors for future therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TAP2 may serve as a promising prognostic marker and immune target in human cancers, warranting further investigation into its role in tumor immunity."
40074332,Potential New Tumors Associated with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC).,"Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) is traditionally associated with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, predominantly impacting breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. However, recent research suggests that these mutations may also predispose carriers to a broader spectrum of malignancies, including biliary tract, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, and gastric cancers. This review presents findings from extensive datasets, including a significant study from a nationwide Japanese biobank that examined cancer risks in 63,828 patients and 37,086 controls. Our review highlights notable associations, such as an increased risk of uterine and cervical cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers and increased risk of esophageal and gastric cancers in BRCA2 mutation carriers. These emerging associations underscore the necessity of revisiting and potentially expanding current clinical guidelines to incorporate these additional risks. These findings advocate a comprehensive approach to genetic counseling and underscore the importance of tailored cancer surveillance strategies in populations carrying BRCA mutations. This expanded understanding could significantly influence preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies, promoting personalized approaches to manage and potentially prevent these malignancies in genetically susceptible populations."
40073867,The contribution of coding variants to the heritability of multiple cancer types using UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data.,"Genome-wide association studies have been highly successful at identifying common variants associated with cancer; however, they do not explain all the inherited risks of cancer. Family-based studies, targeted sequencing, and, more recently, exome-wide association studies have identified rare coding variants in some genes associated with cancer risk, but the overall contribution of these variants to the heritability of cancer is less clear. Here, we describe a method to estimate the genome-wide contribution of rare coding variants to heritability that fits models to the burden effect sizes using an empirical Bayesian approach. We apply this method to the burden of protein-truncating variants in over 15,000 genes for 11 cancers in the UK Biobank using whole-exome sequencing data on over 400,000 individuals. We extend the method to consider the overlap of genes contributing to pairs of cancers. We found ovarian cancer to have the greatest proportion of heritability attributable to protein-truncating variants in genes (46%). The joint cancer models highlight significant clustering of cancer types, including a near-complete overlap in susceptibility genes for breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Our results provide insights into the contribution of rare coding variants to the heritability of cancer and identify additional genes with strong evidence of susceptibility to multiple cancer types."
40073758,Anti-Cancer Potential of a new Derivative of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester targeting the Centrosome.,"Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive T-cell lymphoma affecting children and young adults. About 30% of patients develop therapy resistance therefore new precision medicine drugs are highly warranted. Multiple rounds of structure-activity optimization of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester have resulted in CM14. CM14 causes upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress response and downregulation of DNA replication genes leading to G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis induction. In accordance with this, an unbiased proteomics approach, confocal microscopy and molecular modeling showed that TUBGCP2, member of the centrosomal gamma-TuRC complex, is a direct interaction partner of CM14. CM14 overcomes ALK inhibitor resistance in ALCL and is also active in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Interestingly, CM14 also induced cell death in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells thus suggesting an unexpected role in solid cancers. Thus, we synthesized and thoroughly characterized a novel TUBGCP2 targeting drug that is active in ALCL but has also potential for other malignancies."
40071579,Electrochemical Duplex Detection of E2 and E6 Genes of Human Papillomavirus Type 16 and Determination of Physical Status in High-Risk Cervical Carcinoma.,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is a key driver in the development of cervical carcinoma, with the integration of its genome into the host DNA marking a critical step in disease progression. Monitoring the physical state of HPV-16, particularly the transition from episomal to integrated forms, is essential for evaluating the risk of malignancy development in cervix. This study presents the development of a duplex electrochemical biosensor for the simultaneous detection of the E2 and E6 genes of HPV-16. Using a one-step sandwich hybridization assay, the biosensor was able to detect HPV-16 E2 and E6 genes with a sensitivity of 8 copies/mL and 12 copies/mL respectively and distinguish between the episomal and integrated forms based on the E2/E6 ratio (cut-off 0.77, 100% sensitivity/specificity). The sensor was validated with 30 clinical cervical tissue samples, providing results comparable to qPCR method. This novel biosensor offers a rapid and efficient platform for the detection and monitoring of HPV-16, with potential applications in cervical cancer screening and prognosis."
40071471,Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing in prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to characterize prostate cancer at the molecular level. The underlying premise of next-generation sequencing technologies and their current and evolving applications in prostate cancer management are provided in the review. RECENT FINDINGS: Improved methodologies are allowing timely sequencing of the coding regions or both the coding and noncoding regions of the genome to help identify potential mutations and structural variations in the prostate cancer genome, some of which are currently also targetable therapeutically. DNA microarray- based differential gene expression has been supplanted by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which not only allows for more accurate quantitation but also nucleotide-level resolution to investigate the entire transcriptome, including alternative gene spliced transcripts and noncoding RNA transcripts, whose full clinical implications have yet to be fully understood and realized. Gene classifier platforms that predict risk of recurrence or metastasis are being incorporated into prostate cancer management algorithms. In the appropriate clinical context, not only somatic but also germline mutation testing is being recommended. SUMMARY: Continued clinical integration of sequencing technologies and ongoing research will lead to improved understanding of prostate cancer biology and prostate cancer treatment."
40069535,RBIS as a prognostic biomarker for progression-free survival in prostate cancer: insights from bioinformatics and immune infiltration analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly prevalent malignancy among men, with significant regional variations in incidence and poor survival rates in advanced stages. Ribosome biogenesis (RB) is pivotal for cancer cell proliferation, yet the specific role of the ribosomal biogenesis factor (RBIS) gene in PCa remains underexplored. This study aims to elucidate the biological and clinical relevance of RBIS in PCa progression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA database and three GEO datasets to compare RBIS expression in normal versus tumor tissues. The relationship between RBIS expression and clinicopathological features, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses identified key biological processes involving RBIS, while genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity were also evaluated. RESULTS: RBIS expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues and correlated with advanced tumor stage, higher Gleason scores, and poorer PFS. Multivariate analysis confirmed RBIS as an independent prognostic marker. Functional analysis implicated RBIS in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Moreover, RBIS expression was associated with immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: RBIS represents a promising biomarker for PCa diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Further research is required to validate these findings and advance RBIS's clinical application, offering novel insights into PCa management."
40068078,Cathepsins and their role in gynecological cancers: Evidence from two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Prior studies have reported connections between cathepsins (CTS) and gynecological cancers; however, the exact causal links are yet to be fully understood. Leveraging publicly accessible genome-wide association study summary datasets, we performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariate MR (MVMR) analysis, with the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary approach. MR analysis demonstrated inverse associations between CTSB and cervical cancer (IVW: odds ratio [OR] = 0.9995, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9991-0.9999, P = .0418), CTSE and ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 0.9197, 95% CI = 0.8505-0.9944, P = .0358), CTSZ and ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 0.9449, 95% CI = 0.8938-0.9990, P = .0459), CTSE and high grade serous ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 0.8939, 95% CI = 0.8248-0.9689, P = .0063), and CTSZ and high grade serous ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 0.9269, 95% CI = 0.8667-0.9913, P = .0268). A positive correlation was identified between CTSH and clear cell ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 1.1496, 95% CI = 1.0368-1.2745, P = .0081). Nevertheless, subsequent adjustment for the false discovery rate revealed that none of the P-values retained statistical significance (PFDR > 0.05). MVMR analysis results elucidated that CTSZ was inversely associated with cervical cancer (IVW: OR = 0.9988, 95% CI = 0.9981-0.9996, P = .0022). Moreover, a positive association was noted between CTSF and cervical cancer (IVW: OR = 1.0007, 95% CI = 1.0000-1.0014, P = .0364), and similarly, between CTSS and cervical cancer (IVW: OR = 1.0005, 95% CI = 1.0000-1.0011, P = .0490). CTSO exhibited a positive association with non-endometrioid endometrial cancer (IVW: OR = 1.4405, 95% CI = 1.1864-1.7490, P < .001), and CTSH was positively associated with clear cell ovarian cancer (IVW: OR = 1.1167, 95% CI = 1.0131-1.2310, P = .0263). The MVMR analysis findings reveal that CTSZ emerges as a protective element against cervical cancer, whereas CTSF and CTSS represent risk factors for this disease. CTSO stands out as a risk factor for non-endometrioid endometrial cancer, and CTSH acts as a risk factor for clear cell ovarian cancer. This study elucidates causative connections between CTS and gynecological cancers, providing innovative insights for diagnostic and therapeutic optimization."
40068042,The association between benign and malignant prostatic hyperplastic diseases and blood and urine biomarkers: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The identification of suitable biomarkers holds significant clinical importance for the early detection of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between BPH and blood and urine biomarkers (BUB), as well as PCa and BUB. Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with BPH or PCa were derived from recent genome-wide association studies. The UK Biobank cohort comprised 363,228 individuals with BUB test data, enabling the calculation of a polygenic risk score for BPH or PCa. Bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the potential causal association between candidate BUB and BPH, as well as between BUB and PCa. In this study, a notable correlation was observed between BPH and gamma-glutamyl transferase (r = 1.061658447, P = .028697428). PCa exhibited significant associations with insulin-like growth factor 1 (r = 1.119051258, P = .004101067), Lipoprotein A (r = 1.120348291, P = .038093372), total protein (r = 0.87643517, P = .01657563), and non-albumin protein (r = 0.905333153, P = .03103913). The findings offer valuable insights into the significance of BUB in the timely identification and management of BPH and PCa."
40067513,PLOD3 as a novel oncogene in prognostic and immune infiltration risk model based on multi-machine learning in cervical cancer.,"Cervical carcinoma (CC) remains a significant global health issue despite advancements in screening and treatment. To improve prognostic accuracy and therapeutic strategies, we developed a multi-machine learning prognostic model based on metabolic-associated genes. This study integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and spatial data from multiple databases to identify key metabolic genes with a causal relationship to CC. We identified 112 key metabolic genes, which were used to construct and validate a prognostic model through various machine learning algorithms. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the MAPK cascade plays a crucial role in metabolic processes. To pinpoint key metabolic genes, we constructed WGCNA and extracted 337 key genes. Supervised principal component analysis and random survival forests were incorporated into the final model, which showed strong predictive ability in classifying patients. Furthermore, the model demonstrated notable variations in immune cell infiltration among risk categories, which shown regulatory T cells may be involved in immune suppression, and natural killer cells might have a limited effect in tumor clearance. Spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analyses further validated the model, uncovering tumor heterogeneity and distinct intercellular communication patterns associated with different risk levels. The functional experiment results indicated that down expression of PLOD3 could suppress the proliferation of CC cell. In this study, offer a precision medicine methods for predicting patient outcomes as well as fresh insights into the metabolic foundations, which may contribute to the prognosis and immunotherapy of CC. Additionally, we discovered PLOD3 to be a novel oncogene in CC. These findings imply that this model may be applied to assess prognostic risk and identify potential therapeutic targets for CC patients."
40066698,Single-cell profiling reveals the intratumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment in cervical adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical adenocarcinoma (ADC) is more aggressive compared to other types of cervical cancer (CC), such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and tumor heterogeneity are recognized as pivotal factors in cancer progression and therapy. However, the disparities in TIME and heterogeneity between ADC and SCC are poorly understood. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 11 samples of ADC tumor tissues, with other 4 SCC samples served as controls. The immunochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence were conducted to validate our findings. RESULTS: Compared to SCC, ADC exhibited unique enrichments in several sub-clusters of epithelial cells with elevated stemness and hyper-malignant features, including the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster. ADC displayed a highly immunosuppressive environment characterized by the enrichment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-promoting neutrophils. The Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster recruits Tregs via ALCAM-CD6 signaling, while Tregs reciprocally induce stemness in the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster through TGFbeta signaling. Importantly, our study revealed that the Epi_10_CYSTM1 cluster could serve as a valuable predictor of lymph node metastasis for CC patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significance of ADC-specific cell clusters in establishing a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately contributing to the heightened aggressiveness and poorer prognosis of ADC compared to SCC. FUNDING: Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82002753; 82072882; 81500475) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (2021JJ40324; 2022JJ70103)."
40065286,Safety and efficacy of genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced and oligometastatic prostate cancer (SEGNO): study protocol for an open-label prospective phase II umbrella clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: The management of locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPCa) remains a clinical challenge. The heterogeneous nature of PCa prompts a need for precision treatment. This study aims to verify whether genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced PCa and OMPCa can result in an improvement in the pathological responses and survival outcomes in a Chinese population. METHODS: In this open-label prospective phase II umbrella clinical trial, 40 patients will be enrolled. Next-generation sequencing data analysis of PCa tissues from the diagnostic needle biopsies will be performed. The genomically evaluable patients will be divided into 4 groups on the basis of genomic testing results, and receive 6 cycles of patient-tailored neoadjuvant systemic therapy targeted to alternative molecular pathways (including parmiparib, cisplatin, tislelizumab or docetaxel, respectively), and both in combination with rezvilutamide and goserelin microspheres. The primary endpoint is the rate of pathologic complete response. Secondary endpoints include rates of clinical complete response and pathological minimal residual disease (defined as residual tumor 5 mm or less), overall survival, progression-free survival and safety outcomes. DISCUSSION: SEGNO, to the best of our knowledge, is the first umbrella clinical trial designed to provide high-level evidence to support the implementation of genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced PCa and OMPCa. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov, NCT06387056."
40065022,"Analysis of HPV-16 viral load, integration status, and p16 expression in relation to EBV co-infection and cervical lesion severity.","Cervical cancer, one of the most common cancers in women, is primarily driven by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) infections, particularly HPV-16. Co-infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been reported to exacerbate disease progression by influencing HPV genome integration. This study examines HPV-16 integration status, p16INK4a expression, and their relationship with EBV co-infection and viral load in cervical cancer cases. In this study, 134 HPV-16-positive formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical samples were collected and analyzed for HPV-16 viral load, genome integration and EBV co-infection, followed by p16INK4a immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed to examine the association between viral markers and cervical cancer progression. HPV-16 viral loads varied significantly by histological grade, with the highest loads observed in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2) lesions. HPV integration status revealed episomal forms in 32.8% of samples, mixed forms in 56%, and fully integrated forms in 11.2%. p16INK4a expression correlated with disease progression, increasing with CIN grade and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). EBV was detected in 13.4% of samples, but no significant associations were found between EBV infection and HPV integration, viral load, or p16INK4a expression levels. HPV-16 viral load and integration status are strongly associated with cervical lesion severity, while p16INK4a expression increases with lesion grade, indicating its utility as a diagnostic marker. EBV co-infection did not significantly impact lesion progression, suggesting that its role in cervical cancer remains unclear."
40064858,Rare pathogenic structural variants show potential to enhance prostate cancer germline testing for African men.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is highly heritable, with men of African ancestry at greatest risk and associated lethality. Lack of representation in genomic data means germline testing guidelines exclude for Africans. Established that structural variations (SVs) are major contributors to human disease and prostate tumourigenesis, their role is under-appreciated in familial and therapeutic testing. Utilising clinico-methodologically matched deep-sequenced whole-genome data for 113 African versus 57 European PCa patients, we interrogate 42,966 high-quality germline SVs using a best-fit pathogenicity prediction workflow. We identify 15 potentially pathogenic SVs representing 12.4% African and 7.0% European patients, of which 72% and 86% met germline testing standard-of-care recommendations, respectively. Notable African-specific loss-of-function gene candidates include DNA damage repair MLH1 and BARD1 and tumour suppressors FOXP1, WASF1 and RB1. Representing only a fraction of the vast African diaspora, this study raises considerations with respect to the contribution of kilo-to-mega-base rare variants to PCa pathogenicity and African-associated disparity."
40061333,Mixed-effects polygenic risk score Phenome-wide association study detects genetic correlation between colorectal cancer risk and phenotype data extracted from the electronic health record.,"Many factors, including environmental and genetic variables, contribute to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) risk. Some of these risk factors may share underlying genetics with CRC. We investigated potential shared genetics by performing a Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with a multi-ancestry CRC polygenic risk score (PRS). The discovery cohort (N=426,464) consisted of ancestrally diverse participants from the United Kingdom Biobank. The replication cohort (N=87,271) consisted of ancestrally diverse participants from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. We used a mixed-effects model to adjust for the presence of related individuals in both datasets. To preserve power, we limited testing to ancestor phecodes derived from the electronic health record (EHR), which were not likely to be a result of CRC or its treatment. We discovered and replicated associations between the CRC PRS and breast cancer, prostate cancer, obesity, smoking and alcohol use (discovery p< 1.1e-4; replication p<0.0019). As these results corroborate findings from other studies using orthogonal methods, we demonstrate that a CRC PRS can be used as a proxy for genetic risk for CRC when investigating shared genetics between CRC and other phenotypes. Further study of the relationship between PRS from multiple traits with EHR data may reveal additional shared genetic factors."
40060229,The Association Between RACK1 Gene Polymorphisms rs1279736 and rs3756585 in Uterine Cervical Cancer with the Risk Factor of HPV: A Focus on Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is the second most common malignancy among women worldwide. The Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) has a key role in regulating the pathways of cell signaling, angiogenesis, cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. This study investigated the association of polymorphisms rs1279736 and rs3756585 with cervical cancer. METHODS: In this study, 100 LB pap-smear and paraffin block samples of cervical squamous carcinoma associated with Human papillomavirus (HPV) were selected along with 100 LB smear cytology samples from healthy women with normal pap smears, serving as the control group. Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples, and the polymorphisms rs1279736 and rs3756585 in the RACK1 genes were examined using the RFLP-PCR and ARMS-PCR methods, respectively. RESULTS: The rs1279736 polymorphism shows that the chance of cervical cancer in individuals with CA and AA genotypes is 3.772 and 1.852 times that of CC genotypes, respectively. This suggests that the A allele is involved in developing cervical cancer (P=0.005; OR=2.113). The rs3756585 polymorphism indicates that the chance of cervical cancer in TG and GG genotypes is 0.373 and 4.235 times that of TT genotypes, respectively. This also points towards the involvement of the G allele in the development of cervical cancer (P=0.032; OR=1.800). Also, there was no significant relationship between the genotype of polymorphisms, age, and subtype of papillomavirus 16 and 18 in patients. CONCLUSION: The present study was conducted for the first time. Our results showed that two polymorphisms are significantly associated with cervical cancer."
40060050,"Fast, flexible analysis of differences in cellular composition with crumblr.","Changes in cell type composition play an important role in human health and disease. Recent advances in single-cell technology have enabled the measurement of cell type composition at increasing cell lineage resolution across large cohorts of individuals. Yet this raises new challenges for statistical analysis of these compositional data to identify changes in cell type frequency. We introduce crumblr (DiseaseNeurogenomics.github.io/crumblr), a scalable statistical method for analyzing count ratio data using precision-weighted linear mixed models incorporating random effects for complex study designs. Uniquely, crumblr performs statistical testing at multiple levels of the cell lineage hierarchy using a multivariate approach to increase power over tests of one cell type. In simulations, crumblr increases power compared to existing methods while controlling the false positive rate. We demonstrate the application of crumblr to published single-cell RNA-seq datasets for aging, tuberculosis infection in T cells, bone metastases from prostate cancer, and SARS-CoV-2 infection."
40057497,Microbial metabolites control self-renewal and precancerous progression of human cervical stem cells.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common female cancer, with the uterine ectocervix being the most commonly affected site. However, cervical stem cells, their differentiation, and their regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we report the isolation of a population enriched for human cervical stem cells and their regulatory mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterize the cellular heterogeneity of the human ectocervix and identify cluster-specific cell surface markers. By establishing normal and precancerous cervical organoids and an intralingual transplantation system, we show that ITGB4 and CD24 enable enrichment of human and murine ectocervical stem cells. We discover that Lactobacilli-derived lactic acid regulates cervical stem cells' self-renewal and early tumorigenesis through the PI3K-AKT pathway and YAP1. Finally, we show that D-lactic acid suppresses growth of normal and precancerous organoids, while L-lactic acid does not. Our findings reveal roles of human cervical stem cells and microbial metabolites in cervical health and diseases."
40056906,Neoadjuvant fuzuloparib combined with abiraterone for localized high-risk prostate cancer (FAST-PC): A single-arm phase 2 study.,"Preclinical studies suggest synergistic effects between androgen receptor inhibitors and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This phase 2 trial (NCT05223582) evaluates neoadjuvant fuzuloparib plus abiraterone in 35 treatment-naive men with localized high-risk prostate cancer. Patients receive six cycles of therapy followed by radical prostatectomy. Primary endpoints are pathological complete response (pCR) and minimal residual disease (MRD, </=5 mm). The combined pCR/MRD rate is 46% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29%-63%), with a 53% 2-year biochemical progression-free survival rate. Grade >/=3 adverse events occur in 23% of patients. Biallelic homologous recombination repair/BRCA2 alterations correlate with faster prostate-specific antigen decline. Post-treatment genomic analyses reveal reduced MYC amplification and proliferation markers, alongside activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition/activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathways. The trial meets its primary endpoint, demonstrating feasibility and preliminary efficacy, while exploratory biomarkers may guide future studies."
40055810,Low-coverage whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA to predict and track immunotherapy response in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Outcomes under anti-PD-(L)1 therapy have been variable in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without reliable predictive biomarkers so far. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has demonstrated potential clinical utility to support clinical decisions, but requires prior tumor genetic profiling for proper interpretation, and wide adoption remains limited due to high costs. METHODS: Tumor-agnostic low-coverage ctDNA whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) was used to longitudinally track genome-wide copy number variations (CNVs) and fragmentation features in advanced NSCLC patients (n = 118 samples from 49 patients) and healthy controls (n = 57). Tumor PD-L1 expression was available for comparison. FINDINGS: Fragmentation features and CNVs were complementary indicators, whose combination significantly increased ctDNA detection compared to single-marker assessments (+ 20.3% compared to CNV analysis alone). Baseline fragment length alterations, but not CNVs, were significantly associated with subsequent progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 4.10, p = 6.58e-05) and could improve PFS predictions based on tumor PD-L1 expression alone (HR = 2.70, p = 0.019). Residual CNVs or aberrant fragmentation of ctDNA under ongoing therapy could stratify patients according to the subsequent response duration (median 5.8 vs. 47.0 months, p = 1.13e-06). The integrative analysis of ctDNA fragment characteristics at baseline, tumor PD-L1 expression, and residual ctDNA under ongoing treatment constituted the strongest independent predictor of PFS (p = 6.25e-05) and overall survival (p = 1.3e-03) in multivariable analyses along with other clinicopathologic variables. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential clinical utility of lcWGS for the tumor-agnostic stratification and monitoring of advanced NSCLC under PD-(L)1 blockade based on CNV and fragmentomic profiling."
40055773,Blockade of alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8 integrins with a chromogranin A-derived peptide inhibits TGFbeta activation in tumors and suppresses tumor growth.,"BACKGROUND: The alphavbeta6- and alphavbeta8-integrins, two cell-adhesion receptors upregulated in many solid tumors, can promote the activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, by interacting with the RGD sequence of the latency-associated peptide (LAP)/TGFbeta complex. We have previously described a chromogranin A-derived peptide, called ""peptide 5a"", which recognizes the RGD-binding site of both alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8 with high affinity and selectivity, and efficiently accumulates in alphavbeta6- or alphavbeta8-positive tumors. This study aims to demonstrate that peptide 5a can inhibit TGFbeta activation in tumors and suppress tumor growth. METHODS: Peptide 5a was chemically coupled to human serum albumin (HSA) to prolong its plasma half-life. The integrin recognition properties of this conjugate (called 5a-HSA) and its capability to block TGFbeta activation by alphavbeta6(+) and/or alphavbeta8(+) cancer cells or by regulatory T cells (Tregs) were tested in vitro. The in vivo anti-tumor effects of 5a-HSA, alone and in combination with S-NGR-TNF (a vessel-targeted derivative of tumor necrosis factor-a), were investigated in various murine tumor models, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma, prostate cancer, and mammary adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: In vitro assays showed that peptide 5a coupled to HSA maintains its capability of recognizing alphavbeta6 and alphavbeta8 with high affinity and selectivity and inhibits TGFbeta activation mediated by alphavbeta6(+) and/or alphavbeta8(+) cancer cells, as well as by alphavbeta8(+) Tregs. In vivo studies showed that systemic administration of 5a-HSA to tumor-bearing mice can reduce TGFbeta signaling in neoplastic tissues and promote CD8-dependent anti-tumor responses. Combination therapy studies showed that 5a-HSA can enhance the anti-tumor activity of S-NGR-TNF, leading to tumor eradication. CONCLUSION: Peptide 5a is an efficient tumor-homing inhibitor of alphavbeta6- and alphavbeta8-integrin that after coupling to HSA, can be used as a drug to block integrin-dependent TGFbeta activation in tumors and promote immunotherapeutic responses."
40055259,Extra-central nervous system metastasis from high-grade glioma: a single-institution experience.,"PURPOSE: Extra-central nervous system metastasis (ECM) from glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas (HGGs) is exceedingly rare, likely due to central nervous system barriers and the short overall survival (OS) in HGG patients, limiting the timeframe for metastasis. Improved treatments have extended survival, potentially increasing ECM incidence, though mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective study examines HGG patients (n = 16) with ECM treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1993 to 2023. RESULTS: Median age at HGG and ECM diagnoses were 33.6 and 35.1 years, respectively, with a slight female predominance. Diagnoses included glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype WHO Grade 4 (n = 11), epithelioid glioblastoma WHO Grade 4 (n = 2), astrocytoma IDH-mutant WHO Grade 4 (n = 2), and H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma (n = 1). Median interval from HGG to ECM diagnosis was 10 months. The temporal lobe was the most common HGG site, with ECM primarily in cervical lymph nodes, bone, parotid gland, and cranial soft tissues. Genomic profiling identified TP53, EGFR, RB1, NF1, TERT promoter, and BRAF V600E mutations. Median OS from HGG diagnosis was 23.4 months, and median OS following ECM diagnosis was 5.9 months. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy to ECM sites extended survival. Leptomeningeal disease was present in 50% of cases and correlated with worse prognosis. ECM typically developed in advanced disease stages. CONCLUSION: This study highlights genomic alterations, management, and outcomes associated with ECM in HGG. Tumor spread may stem from neurosurgical manipulation and occur via hematogenous and/or lymphatic routes. Multimodal treatment extends survival. Targeted therapies based on molecular profiles should be explored."
40054999,Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus statement on essential biomarkers for immunotherapy clinical protocols.,"Immunotherapy of cancer is now an essential pillar of treatment for patients with many individual tumor types. Novel immune targets and technical advances are driving a rapid exploration of new treatment strategies incorporating immune agents in cancer clinical practice. Immunotherapies perturb a complex system of interactions among genomically unstable tumor cells, diverse cells within the tumor microenvironment including the systemic adaptive and innate immune cells. The drive to develop increasingly effective immunotherapy regimens is tempered by the risk of immune-related adverse events. Evidence-based biomarkers that measure the potential for therapeutic response and/or toxicity are critical to guide optimal patient care and contextualize the results of immunotherapy clinical trials. Responding to the lack of guidance on biomarker testing in early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials, we propose a definition and listing of essential biomarkers recommended for inclusion in all such protocols. These recommendations are based on consensus provided by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) faculty with input from the SITC Pathology and Biomarker Committees and the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer readership. A consensus-based selection of essential biomarkers was conducted using a Delphi survey of SCION faculty. Regular updates to these recommendations are planned. The inaugural list of essential biomarkers includes complete blood count with differential to generate a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or systemic immune-inflammation index, serum lactate dehydrogenase and albumin, programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite stability assessment, and tumor mutational burden. Inclusion of these biomarkers across early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials will capture variation among trials, provide deeper insight into the novel and established therapies, and support improved patient selection and stratification for later-phase clinical trials."
40051782,PCBP2 promotes immune evasion via cGAS-STING pathway in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.,"Immunotherapy resistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), primarily due to immune evasion mechanisms. This study aims to explore cancer-intrinsic immune evasion-related genes (CIERGs) in PCa and develop a predictive signature for biochemical recurrence (BCR). Bulk RNA-seq data and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) were obtained from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus database. The scRNA-seq data analysis revealed higher immune evasion scores in tumor cells compared to normal cells. Differentially expressed genes from TCGA-PRAD and GSE70769 cohorts were intersected with 182 core immune evasion genes, followed by univariate Cox regression, identifying 48 CIERGs significantly associated with BCR. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering revealed two immune evasion-related PCa subtypes. A risk signature based on CIERGs was developed using LASSO regression, and a nomogram was created to predict BCR-free survival. Among the 48 identified CIERGs, poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) emerged as a key risk factor associated with poor prognosis in PCa, and its function was validated in vitro. NMF clustering identified two subtypes, with the C1 subtype having a poorer prognosis. Gene Set Variation Analysis highlighted enrichment in cell cycle, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathways in the C1 subtype. A CIERGs-based risk signature, including six key genes, was developed and validated, with the nomogram showing high predictive accuracy. In vitro experiments showed PCBP2 promotes PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-STING pathway. The CIERGs signature provides a precise prediction of BCR, with PCBP2 emerging as a potential therapeutic target due to its inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway in PCa."
40051434,"A comprehensive study on the impact of Ligustrum vicaryi L. fruit polysaccharide on myocardial fibrosis through animal experiments, network pharmacology and molecular docking.","BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is a prevalent pathological condition associated with various heart diseases, such as heart failure and arrhythmias, which disrupt electrical signals and reduce pumping efficiency. This research explored the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of Ligustrum vicaryi L. fruit polysaccharide (LVFP) on MF. METHODS: In vivo experiments, including fibrosis markers assay, echocardiography, HE staining, Sirius red staining, and Masson's trichrome staining, were performed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of LVFP in treating isoproterenol (ISO)-induced MF. We utilized the PharmMapper database to identify targets of LVFP, aiming to explore potential targets. Additionally, we obtained MF-related targets from the GeneCards database. We utilized Venny, a bioinformatics tool, to identify the intersection between the targets of LVFP and those related to MF. We utilized the STRING database to construct a protein interaction network for the overlapping targets and identified key targets for LVFP in treating MF through cytoHubba analysis. We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis on the intersection targets. We also examined the interaction between LVFP and the key targets using molecular docking techniques. RESULTS: LVFP significantly inhibited fibrosis biomarker such as hydroxyproline (HYP) and decreased myocardial fibrosis level as shown by heart weight to tibia length (HW/TL) measurement when compared to ISO-treated mice. Additionally, it increased ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) levels. LVFP showed decreased collagen levels compared to the ISO-treated mice by histological quantification of cardiac fibrosis. Based on the monosaccharide structures of LVFP, 413 targets were identified, with 67 associated with MF. Analysis indicated that the 9 hub genes (AKT1, HSP90AA1, SRC, GSK3beta, VEGFR2, RHOA, ENO1, PKM, and IL-2) play roles in MF treatment by participating in signaling pathways related to prostate cancer, lipid and atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. Molecular docking results showed that LVFP exhibited strong binding potential to VEGFR2 (-8.65 kcal/mol), AKT1 (-7.36 kcal/mol) and GSK3beta (-7.68 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: LVFP shows promise as a therapeutic agent for MF, primarily through the regulation of various signaling pathways and targets. These findings provide novel insights for the treatment of MF utilizing LVFP."
40050897,Epigenome-wide analysis reveals potential biomarkers for radiation-induced toxicity risk in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with radiation therapy (RT) being a key treatment for clinically localized and locally advanced cases. Given high survival rates, addressing long-term side effects of RT is crucial for preserving quality-of-life. Radiogenomics, the study of genetic variations affecting response to radiation, has primarily focussed on genomic biomarkers, while DNA methylation studies offer insights into RT responses. Although most research has centred on tumours, no epigenome-wide association studies have explored peripheral blood biomarkers of RT-induced toxicities in prostate cancer patients. Identifying such biomarkers could reveal molecular mechanisms underlying RT response and enable personalized treatment. METHODS: We analysed 105 prostate cancer patients (52 cases and 53 controls). Cases developed grade >/= 2 genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal late toxicity after 12 months of starting RT, whereas controls did not. An epigenome-wide association study of post-RT toxicities was performed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip, adjusting for age and cell type composition. We constructed two methylation risk scores-one using differentially methylated positions (MRSsites) and another using differentially methylated regions (MRSregions)-as well as a Support Vector Machine-based methylation signature (SVMsites). We evaluated RT effects on biological age and stochastic epigenetic mutations within established radiation response pathways. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Pre-RT methylation analysis identified 56 differentially methylated positions (adjusted p-value </= 0.05), and 6 differentially methylated regions (p-value </= 0.05) associated with the genes NTM, ACAP1, IL1RL2, VOOP1, AKR1E2, and an intergenic region on chromosome 13 related to Short/Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements. Both Methylation Risk Scores (MRSsites AUC = 0.87; MRSregions AUC = 0.89) and the 8-CpG Support Vector Machine signature (SVMsites AUC = 0.98) exhibited strong discriminatory accuracy in classifying patients in the discovery cohort. Gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment (adjusted p-value </= 0.05) of genes involved in DNA repair, inflammatory response, tissue repair, and oxidative stress response pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetic biomarkers show potential for predicting severe long-term adverse effects of RT in prostate cancer patients. The identified methylation patterns provide valuable insights into toxicity mechanisms and may aid personalized treatment strategies. However, validation in independent cohorts is essential to confirm their predictive value and clinical applicability."
40050481,The role and mechanism of CHMP4C in poor prognosis and drug sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Chromatin modified protein 4C (CHMP4C) is a charged polyvesicular protein (CHMP) that is involved in the composition of the endosomal sorting complex (ESCRT-III) required for transport III and promotes the necessary separation of daughter cells. CHMP4C involved in a wide variety of tumor progress, such as prostate cancer, cervical cancer and lung squamous cell carcinoma. However, the value of CHMP4C in lung adenocarcinoma has not been explored. METHODS: RNA-seq data and lung adenocarcinoma clinical information and corresponding pan-cancer were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to analyze CHMP4C expression and survival prognosis. The differential expression of CHMP4C was analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Clinical samples were collected to verify the differential expression of CHMP4C between lung adenocarcinoma and normal lung tissues via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, qRT‒PCR and Western blotting. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of CHMP4C-related genes were performed. The correlation between CHMP4C and chemosensitivity was analyzed in the TCGA database. Then, qRT‒PCR, western blotting, transwell assays, cell proliferation assays, colony formation assays, wound healing assays, and cell cycle analysis were used to verify the possible regulatory mechanism involved. Molecular docking was used to predict small molecule compounds with potential roles in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: TIMER2.0 database analysis revealed that CHMP4C was differentially expressed in different tumors.Compared with that in healthy lung tissue, CHMP4C was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissue, and subsequent in vitro survival analysis revealed that CHMP4C expression has significant clinical prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma. Enrichment analysis revealed that CHMP4C was mainly related to cell proliferation, cell migration, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, etc. Overexpression of CHMP4C was associated with sensitivity to chemotherapy. Knocking down CHMP4C can significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma cells and prolong the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Molecular docking predicts 10 key drugs that may be used for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: CHMP4C is highly expressed in a variety of tumors. We demonstrated that CHMP4C expression may be associated with the occurrence, development, prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. These findings may open up new research directions and development opportunities for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma."
40050354,Extended spectrum of cancers in PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome.,"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is associated with increased lifetime risks of breast, thyroid, kidney, endometrial, and colorectal cancers, as well as melanoma (collectively, component cancers). We sought to characterize non-component cancers (NCC) in PHTS. Of 701 research participants with PHTS, 340 (49%) had cancer, with 101 (30%) having at least one NCC. Interestingly, 71 (70%) of those with NCC had at least one other PHTS component malignancy. Patients with pathogenic PTEN variants showed higher risks for prostate cancer and soft tissue sarcomas at younger ages than the general population. A literature survey showed independent cases of NCC in PHTS, with PTEN-related molecular changes including second-hit somatic PTEN alterations in a subset of various specimens. We recommend increased awareness regarding NCC in individuals with PHTS, particularly increased risks for prostate cancer and sarcoma. Further studies are needed to define age-related penetrance and accordingly, the appropriate strategies for cancer risk management."
40049807,"Ezrin works as a scaffold protein for a macrophage checkpoint molecule CD47, leading to a poor prognosis for patients with uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma.","OBJECTIVES: Despite recent advances in the immunotherapeutic intervention as the second-line treatment of cervical cancer, including Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, the advanced stages of the disease are still associated with poor prognosis. CD47 is a macrophage checkpoint molecule overexpressed superficially in nearly all cancer types that binds to its receptor on macrophage surface, leading to a disruption of their phagocytic capacities against cancer cells. Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) family member of proteins work as scaffold proteins by crosslinking specific transmembrane proteins to actin filaments, contributing to their plasma membrane localization. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ERM family and CD47 in the uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma (UCSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mRNA expression, intracellular localization, and molecular interaction of CD47 and ERM in BOKU cells derived from human UCSCC were determined using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. CD47 plasma membrane expression was measured by flow cytometry three days after transfection with small interfering RNAs against each ERM. CD47 and ERM expression in tumor tissues from patients with uterine cervical cancer was analyzed using a clinical RNA sequencing database. RESULTS: Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis showed the co-localization of CD47 with all three ERM in the plasma membrane of BOKU cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ezrin but not others reduced the plasma membrane expression of CD47. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the molecular interaction of CD47 with ezrin. Notably, bioinformatic analysis indicated that CD47 and ezrin expressions were markedly increased and positively correlated in the clinical uterine cervical tumor tissues and that higher expressions of ezrin correlates with a poor prognosis for the uterine cervical cancers. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that in uterine cervical cancers, ezrin may be a dominant scaffold protein responsible for CD47 expression and, therefore, is a potential target for developing a novel macrophage checkpoint blockade therapy."
40049327,Early Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Using Whole-Genome Sequencing for Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of using whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-guided systemic therapy in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer compared with the European Association of Urology guideline recommended diagnostics from a Dutch societal perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model combining a decision tree and partitioned survival models was developed to link diagnostic results with subsequent biomarker-guided treatments. Two diagnostic strategies, WGS and guideline-recommended practice-the genomic testing for breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) and deficient mismatch repair, were simulated to compare the health outcome and cost. Treatment effectiveness was estimated through survival analysis using published trial data. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to examine result robustness and to identify conditions under which WGS may be cost-effective. RESULTS: WGS identified an additional 21% of patients eligible for personalized therapy (PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors and olaparib), resulting in an incremental increase in cost (euro14 260) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY = 0.05). These results yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro289 625 per QALY gained. WGS would become cost-effective if the cost of biomarker-guided therapies decreases by 62% and when identifying a proportion of 23% more patients with actional targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that future treatments with improved efficacy and reduced cost could potentially make the WGS strategy cost-effective. Its unaccounted potential value to identify prognostic biomarkers, diagnostic alternatives, and patient heterogeneity should be addressed in future research and considered for optimal implementation. New reimbursement options are needed considering the high prices of biomarker-guided therapies that drive the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio."
40049166,VIPER-TACs leverage viral E3 ligases for disease-specific targeted protein degradation.,"In targeted protein degradation (TPD) a protein of interest is degraded by chemically induced proximity to an E3 ubiquitin ligase. One limitation of using TPD therapeutically is that most E3 ligases have broad tissue expression, which can contribute to toxicity via target degradation in healthy cells. Many pathogenic and oncogenic viruses encode E3 ligases (vE3s), which de facto have strictly limited expression to diseased cells. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for viral E3 pan-essential removing targeting chimeras (VIPER-TACs) that are bi-functional molecules that utilize viral E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively degrade pan-essential proteins and eliminate diseased cells. We find that the human papillomavirus (HPV) ligase E6 can degrade the SARS1 pan-essential target protein in a model of HPV-positive cervical cancer to selectively kill E6 expressing cancer cells. Thus, VIPER-TACs have the capacity to dramatically increase the therapeutic window, alleviate toxicity concerns, and ultimately expand the potential target space for TPD."
40048019,"HPV-driven cancer: from epidemiology to the HPV-driven tumor board proposal, everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask.","BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cancers are well-known clinical entities in different body sites. Cervix, anus, and oropharynx are the most common tumors related to the virus infection. The aim of this work was to highlight similarities and differences among HPV-related cancers of different subsites. METHODS: The narrative review was focused on the following topics: (1) epidemiology, (2) prognostic factors, (3) treatment approaches, (4) radiomic analysis, (5) radiosensitivity, (6) de-escalation strategies. Common aspects as well as differences have been highlighted for cervical, anal and oropharyngeal HPV-related tumors. RESULTS: Common prognosticators in terms of patients characteristics (anemia, smoking habits), tumor histology (lymph node extracapsular extension) biological features (high circuating HPV DNA), blood cell immunomodulating response (high level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) as good parameters of radiosensitivity (radiosensitivity index RSI, and genomic adjusted radiation dose GARD) have been found among the analyzed tumor subsites. On the contrary, other aspects like treatment approaches (different RT techniques and doses), radiomic analysis and de-intensification strategies were found to be different among tumors. CONCLUSION: HPV-related tumors have several common prognostic and predictive features that do not translate into common therapeutic approaches and de-intensification strategies. A better understanding of which factors are associated with a high risk of early recurrence or favourble clinical outcomes could help in guiding clinical assessment and screening activities and might improve efforts for precision medicine."
40048009,Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) pathway's role in cancer cell plasticity and drug resistance.,"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a central regulator of gene expression via the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27. This epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in maintaining cell identity and controlling differentiation, while its dysregulation is closely linked to cancer progression. PRC2 silences tumor suppressor genes, promoting cell proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer stem cell plasticity. Enhancement of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overexpression or gain-of-function mutations have been observed in several cancers, including lymphoma, breast, and prostate cancers, driving aggressive tumor behavior and drug resistance. In addition to EZH2, other PRC2 components, such as embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and suppressor of zeste 12, are essential for complex stability and function. EED, in particular, enhances EZH2 activity and has emerged as a therapeutic target. Inhibitors like MAK683 and EED226 disrupt EED's ability to maintain PRC2 activity, thereby reducing H3K27me3 levels and reactivating tumor suppressor genes. Valemetostat, a dual inhibitor of both EZH2 and EED, has shown promising results in aggressive cancers like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and small-cell lung cancer, underlining the therapeutic potential of targeting multiple PRC2 components. PRC2's role extends beyond gene repression, as it contributes to metabolic reprogramming in tumors, regulating glycolysis and lipid synthesis to fuel cancer growth. Furthermore, PRC2 is implicated in chemoresistance, particularly by modulating DNA damage response and immune evasion. Tazemetostat, a selective EZH2 inhibitor, has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in EZH2-mutant cancers, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and epithelioid sarcoma. However, the compensatory function of enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) in some cancers requires dual inhibition strategies, as seen with agents like UNC1999 and Tulmimetostat, which target both EZH1 and EZH2. Given PRC2's multifaceted role in cancer biology, its inhibition represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. The continued development of PRC2 inhibitors and exploration of their use in combination with standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy has great potential for improving patient outcomes in cancers driven by PRC2 dysregulation."
40046829,"UK-based clinical testing programme for somatic and germline BRCA1/2, ATM and CDK12 mutations in prostate cancer: first results.","OBJECTIVE: Germline BRCA2 pathogenic variants (PVs) are known to cause ~4% of prostate cancer, but other homologous repair genes, BRCA1, ATM, PALB2 and Lynch syndrome genes are also involved. Our objective was to assess the contribution of germline and somatic gene variants to prostate cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We reviewed germline/tumour DNA testing from 450 localised or metastatic prostate cancer cases in NW England mainly from 2022 to 2024. ORs for additional genes used detection rates in controls from the BRIDGES study. RESULTS: 450 cases underwent BRCA1/2 germline/somatic testing with 2 germline PVs in BRCA1 (0.4%) and 27 in BRCA2 (6.0%)-total 6.4% and 6/328 (1.8%) in ATM. There were 280 metastatic prostate cancer samples tested with 11 (4%) somatic BRCA2 and 7 (2.7%) somatic ATM identified with 1 somatic BRCA1. Total PVs in BRCA2 were 31/280 (11%), including germline and indeterminate. CDK12 somatic PVs were found in 9/220 (4.1%), including 2 digenic with BRCA2 and 2 which were biallelic. CONCLUSION: In this continuous clinical evaluation, BRCA2 is the most frequently identified prostate cancer gene with over 10% involvement in metastatic disease. BRCA2 and CDK12 somatic PVs do not appear to be mutually exclusive. BRCA1 does not appear to be a significant contributor to prostate cancer progression."
40046734,Uncovering potential targets for antibody-drug conjugates in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies.,"BACKGROUND: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) play an important role in the targeted therapy of gynecological malignancies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of targets in gynecologic malignancies in order to predict the selection of targets for the development of antibody-drug conjugates. METHODS: In this article, we identified existing ADCs and their targets through clinical trial databases and public genomic datasets, performed differential analysis of tumor antigen targets (TATs) expression between tumor and normal tissues, and evaluated the necessity of the targets for tumor cell lines. RESULTS: In gynecologic malignancies, we have identified several highly expressed TATs, some of which have been targeted by FDA-approved ADCs, such as TROP2 and Nectin-4, although these drugs have not been approved for the treatment of gynecologic cancers. At the same time, we also observed that some targets of ADCs that have not yet been approved by the FDA also show high expression levels in gynecologic malignancies tissues, such as MSLN, ERBB3, NaPi2b, etc. Furthermore, we identified TATs with high expression levels in various pathological subtypes of ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Notably, some TATs are crucial to the survival of tumor cells, such as CD71, TOP1, and TDGF1, which are essential for the survival of ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and other tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We have innovatively predicted the potential targets of ADCs in treating gynecological malignancies and provided a new perspective on applying some FDA-approved ADCs in indications for gynecological cancers."
40044981,EphB4-ephrin-B2 are targets in castration resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: PI3K pathway activation is a common and early event in prostate cancer, from loss of function mutations in PTEN, or activating mutations in PIK3Ca or AKT leading to constitutive activation, induction of growth factor-receptors kinase EphB4 and its ligand ephrin-B2. We hypothesized that induction of EphB4 is an early event required for tumor initiation. Secondly, we hypothesized that EphB4 remains relevant when prostate cancer becomes androgen independent. METHODS: Genetic mouse model of conditional PTEN deletion in prostate epithelium induces tumor in all mice. We tested this model against EPHB4 wild type and deleted in prostate epithelium. This allowed us to test its role in tumor initiation. We also tested an orthogonal approach by using decoy soluble EphB4 to block bidirectional signaling resulting from EphB4-ephrin-B2 interaction. Role of EphB4-ephrin-B2 in androgen deprived mice was tested for role in refractory cancer model. RESULTS: PTEN deletion induces EphB4 and ephrin-B2 in prostate cancer which was substantially reduced when EPHB4 is deleted in the same prostate epithelial cells. sEphB4-alb fusion protein with improved pharmacokinetics similarly inhibited tumor formation, thus establishing the role in tumor initiation. sEphB4-alb retained the efficacy in castration resistant androgen independent prostate cancer. We have thus observed that induction of EphB4 is required for the initiation of prostate cancer in PTEN null mouse and that signaling downstream from EphB4 is required in androgen deprivation and thus castration resistant prostate cancer. Pharmacological inhibition of EphB4 pathway reproduced the results. Targeting EphB4 should be tested in prostate cancer especially those resistant to androgen deprivation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: EphB4 and ephrin-B2 receptor ligand pair is induced in PTEN null prostate cancer, which significantly contributes to the tumor initiation. Secondly, EphB4-ephrin-B2 pathway continue to promote tumor progression even in androgen deprivation and thus hormone refractory tumor. EphB4-ephrin-B2 may be candidates for precision medicine with biomarker-based patient selection with and without concurrent standard of care."
40041913,GSFM: A genome-scale functional module transformation to represent drug efficacy for in silico drug discovery.,"Pharmacotranscriptomic profiles, which capture drug-induced changes in gene expression, offer vast potential for computational drug discovery and are widely used in modern medicine. However, current computational approaches neglected the associations within gene‒gene functional networks and unrevealed the systematic relationship between drug efficacy and the reversal effect. Here, we developed a new genome-scale functional module (GSFM) transformation framework to quantitatively evaluate drug efficacy for in silico drug discovery. GSFM employs four biologically interpretable quantifiers: GSFM_Up, GSFM_Down, GSFM_ssGSEA, and GSFM_TF to comprehensively evaluate the multi-dimension activities of each functional module (FM) at gene-level, pathway-level, and transcriptional regulatory network-level. Through a data transformation strategy, GSFM effectively converts noisy and potentially unreliable gene expression data into a more dependable FM active matrix, significantly outperforming other methods in terms of both robustness and accuracy. Besides, we found a positive correlation between RS(GSFM) and drug efficacy, suggesting that RS(GSFM) could serve as representative measure of drug efficacy. Furthermore, we identified WYE-354, perhexiline, and NTNCB as candidate therapeutic agents for the treatment of breast-invasive carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate cancer, respectively. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments have validated that all identified compounds exhibit potent anti-tumor effects, providing proof-of-concept for our computational approach."
40038525,5-hydroxymethylcytosine sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA identifies epigenomic features in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapies.,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether 5hmC signatures in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are associated with treatment failure to androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT) among men with hormone-naive prostate cancer. METHODS: We collected a total of 139 serial plasma samples from 55 prostate cancer patients receiving ADT at 3 time points including baseline (before initiating ADT, n = 55); 3 months (after initiating ADT, n = 55); and disease progression (n = 15) within 24 months or 24 months if no progression was detected (n = 14). We used selective chemical labeling sequencing to quantify 5hmC abundance across the genome and Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess survival association. RESULTS: Here we show a significant 5hmC difference in 1642 of 23433 genes between patients with and without progression (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1) in baseline plasma samples. Patients with progression demonstrate significant 5hmC enrichments in multiple hallmark gene sets, with androgen responses as the top enriched gene-set (FDR = 1.19E-13). We further show a significant association between high activity scores in these gene sets and poor progression-free survival (P < 0.05), even after adjusting for circulating tumor DNA fraction and prostate-specific antigen values. Additionally, our longitudinal analysis shows that the high activity score is significantly reduced after 3 months of initiating ADT (P = 0.0004) but returns to higher levels when the disease progresses (P = 0.0317). CONCLUSIONS: 5hmC-based activity scores from gene-sets involved in AR responses show great potential in assessing treatment resistance, monitoring disease progression, and identifying patients who would benefit from upfront treatment intensification. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings."
40038097,Exploring druggable targets and inflammation-mediated pathways in cancer: a Mendelian randomization analysis integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer remains a predominant global health challenge, necessitating the ongoing exploration of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: By integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify potential druggable targets at the gene expression and protein levels for multiple cancers. We conducted mediation analysis to explore whether inflammatory factors mediate the pathways linking identified druggable targets to cancer. Phenome-wide MR analysis, drug prediction, and molecular docking were employed to evaluate the medicinal potential. RESULTS: We finally identified five druggable targets: CDKN1A, FES, and PDIA3 were associated with breast cancer, whereas TP53 and VAMP8 were associated with prostate cancer. Mediation analysis identified six inflammatory proteins as potential mediators in the causal pathways from these druggable targets to cancer: caspase 8, interleukin-1-alpha, C-X-C motif chemokine 1, C-C motif chemokine 23, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and interleukin-6. Subsequent analyses further provided evidence supporting the pharmaceutical potential of these five targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified five druggable targets causally associated with breast and prostate cancers, with six inflammatory proteins acting as potential mediators, providing novel insights into the treatment of these cancers."
40037891,Genomic Profiling of Small Cell Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer and its Implications for Targeted Therapies.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to investigate the genomic features of small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCPC) in Japanese patients, assess their relationships with platinum-based chemotherapy efficacy, and evaluate the potential treatment eligibility for therapies using cancer genomic profiling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients diagnosed with SCPC between 2018 and 2022. An expert pathologist reviewed the biopsy specimens according to the World Health Organization prostate cancer classification. Biopsy samples from primary or metastatic lesions were analyzed using FoundationOne((R)) CDx to identify genomic mutations, focusing on DNA damage repair (DDR) mutations and other clinically relevant alterations. Platinum-based chemotherapy efficacy was assessed using progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes. RESULTS: DDR mutations were detected in eight (38.1%) patients, and BRCA mutations were present in three (14.3%) cases. TP53 and RB1 mutations were identified in 15 (71.4%) and 12 (57.1%) cases, respectively. Three (14.8%) patients were identified with microsatellite instability-high or tumor mutational burden-high, making them eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. PFS/OS rates suggested that the presence of these mutations did not significantly impact platinum-based chemotherapy efficacy. Six (28.6%) patients were eligible for treatments approved for prostate cancer in Japan as of 2024. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to reveal the SCPC genomic landscape in Japanese patients. Although genomic mutations, including DDR mutations, were not predictive of platinum-based chemotherapy efficacy, active genomic testing may improve access to targeted therapies for this challenging malignancy, especially where treatment options are limited."
40037419,Exploring the metabolic alterations in cervical cancer induced by HPV oncoproteins: From mechanisms to therapeutic targets.,"The role of human Papillomavirus (HPV) in metabolic reprogramming is implicated in the development and progression of cervical cancer. During carcinogenesis, cancer cells modify various metabolic pathways to generate energy and sustain their growth and development. Cervical cancer, one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting women globally, involves metabolic alterations such as increased glycolysis, elevated lactate production, and lipid accumulation. The oncoproteins, primarily E6 and E7, which are encoded by high-risk HPVs, facilitate the accumulation of several cancer markers, promoting not only the growth and development of cancer but also metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. HPV oncoproteins interact with cellular MYC (c-MYC), retinoblastoma protein (pRB), p53, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), leading to the induction of metabolic reprogramming and favour the Warburg effect. Metabolic reprogramming enables HPV to persist for an extended period and accelerates the progression of cervical cancer. This review summarizes the role of HPV oncoproteins in metabolic reprogramming and their contributions to the development and progression of cervical cancer. Additionally, this review provides insights into how metabolic reprogramming opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies, including the discovery of new and repurposed drugs that could be applied to treat cervical cancer."
40036789,Multi-gene risk score for prediction of clinical outcomes in treatment-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To determine the performance of a multi-gene copy number variation (MG-CNV) risk score in metastatic tissue and plasma biospecimens from treatment-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients for prediction of clinical outcomes. METHODS: The mCRPC tissue and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) biospecimen sequencing results obtained from publicly accessed cohorts in dbGaP, cBioPortal, and an institutional mCRPC cohort were used to develop a MG-CNV risk score derived from gains in AR, MYC, COL22A1, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, NOTCH1 and losses in TMPRSS2, NCOR1, ZBTB16, TP53, NKX3-1 in independent cohorts for determining overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) to first-line androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs). The range of the risk scores for each cohort was dichotomized into ""high-risk"" and ""low-risk"" groups and association with OS/PFS determined. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were applied for survival analyses (P < .05 for statistical significance). RESULTS: Of 1137 metastatic tissue-plasma biospecimens across all cohorts, 699/1137 were treatment-naive mCRPC (235/699 metastatic tissue; 464/699 plasma-cfDNA), and 311/1137 were matched tissue-cfDNA pairs. In multivariable analysis, the MG-CNV risk score derived from metastatic tissue or in cfDNA was statistically significantly associated with OS with high score associated with short survival (hazard ratio = 2.65, confidence interval = 1.99 to 3.51; P = 1.35-11) and shorter PFS to ARPIs (median PFS of 7.8 months) compared with 14 months in patients with low-risk score. CONCLUSIONS: A molecular risk score in treatment-naive mCRPC state obtained either in metastatic tissue or cfDNA predicts clinical survival outcomes and offers a tumor biology-based tool to design biomarker-based enrichment clinical trials."
40034910,A case of multiple bone metastases during the course of non-invasive bladder and prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Secondary bladder tumor is rare. We report a case of a bladder tumor initially thought to be a recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that was ultimately identified as metastasis from gastric cancer treated 16 years prior. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old male with a history of gastric, prostate, and recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer was diagnosed to have multiple bone metastases. Open bone biopsy and cancer gene panel testing identified the primary origin of the metastases as gastric cancer. Retrospective evaluation revealed that what was initially suspected as recurrent bladder tumors were actually metastases from the gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: In cases of metastases with an unknown primary origin, detailed evaluation, including biopsy of the metastatic lesion and genomic testing, is recommended."
40034901,A case of testicular dysgenesis syndrome with squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate harboring a CDK12 mutation.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate is rare, and genetic profiling of this disease has not been established yet. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of primary squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with testicular dysgenesis syndrome. The patient was diagnosed with prostate squamous cell carcinoma following intractable dysuria, and his serum prostate-specific antigen level was low. The patient had multiple lymph node and lung metastases, which led to administration of platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, targeted next-generation genome sequencing was performed to detect CDK12 mutations. CONCLUSION: Early imaging studies should be considered, even if the patient's prostate-specific antigen level is low when dysuria persists despite medical treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of primary squamous cell carcinoma with a CDK12 mutation in a patient with TDS."
40034593,Machine learning models for predicting prostate cancer recurrence and identifying potential molecular biomarkers.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence affects between 20% and 40% of patients, being a significant challenge for predicting clinical outcomes and increasing survival rates. Although serum PSA levels, Gleason score, and tumor staging are sensitive for detecting recurrence, they present low specificity. This study compared the performance of three supervised machine learning models, Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying PCa recurrence events using a dataset of 489 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Besides comparing the models performance, we searched for analyzing whether the incorporation of specific genes expression in the predictor set would enhance the prediction of PCa recurrence, then suggesting these genes as potential biomarkers of patient prognosis. The models showed accuracy above 60% and sensitivity above 65% in all combinations. ANN models were more consistent in their performance across different predictor sets. Notably, SVM models showed strong results in precision and specificity, particularly considering the inclusion of genes selected by feature selection (NETO2, AR, HPN, and KLK3), without compromising sensitivity. However, the relatively high standard deviations observed in some metrics indicate variability across simulations, suggesting a gap for additional studies via different datasets. These findings suggest that genes are potential biomarkers for predicting PCa recurrence in the dataset, representing a promising approach for early prognosis even before the main treatment."
40034476,Integrating Radiosensitivity Index and Radiation Resistance Related Index Improves Prostate Cancer Outcome Prediction.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to establish a nomogram combining 31-gene signature (31-GS), radiosensitivity index (RSI), and radiation-resistance-related gene index (RRRI) to predict recurrence in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Transcriptome data of PCa were obtained from gene expression omnibus and the cancer genome atlas to validate the predictive potential of 3 sets of published biomarkers, namely, 31-GS, RSI, and RRRI. To adjust these markers for the characteristics of PCa, we analyzed 4 PCa-associated radiosensitivity predictive indices based on 31-GS, RSI, and RRRI by the Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analyses, integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification improvement and decision tree model construction were used to compare the radiosensitivity predictive ability of these 4 gene signatures. Key modules and associated functions were identified through a weighted gene co-expression network analysis and gene function enrichment analysis. A nomogram was built to improve the recurrence-prediction capability. RESULTS: We validated and compared the predictive potential of 2 published predictive indices. Based on the 31-GS, RSI, and RRRI, we analyzed 4 PCa-associated radiosensitivity predictive indices: 14Genes, RSI, RRRI, and 20Genes. Among them, 14Genes showed the most promising predictive performance and discriminative capacity. Genes in the key module defined by the 14Genes model were significantly enriched in radiation therapy-related cell death pathways. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve and decision tree variable importance for 14Genes was the highest in the cancer genome atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus Series (GSE) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully established a radiosensitivity-related nomogram, which had excellent performance in predicting recurrence in patients with PCa. For patients who received radiation therapy, the 20Genes and RRRI models can be used to predict recurrence-free survival, whereas 20Genes is more radiation therapy-specific but needs further external validation."
40034245,Summary from the NCI clinical trials planning meeting on next generation of clinical trials in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer().,The National Cancer Institute organized a virtual Clinical Trials Planning Meeting (CTPM) on 'Defining the next generation of clinical trials with combination therapies in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)' led by the Bladder Cancer Task Force of the NCI Genitourinary Cancers Steering Committee. The purpose of this meeting was to accelerate advances in clinical trials for patients with high-risk NMIBC. The meeting delivered a multidisciplinary expert consensus on optimal strategies for next-generation clinical trial designs in NMIBC with prioritization of combination therapies. Two clinical trial concepts were developed for potential implementation within the National Clinical Trials Network.
40033417,A novel lncRNA FLJ promotes castration resistance in prostate cancer through AR mediated autophagy.,"BACKGROUND: Progression to castration resistance is the leading cause of death in prostate cancer patients. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently become a focal point in the regulation of cancer development. However, few lncRNAs associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have been reported. METHODS: Firstly, we explore the CRPC associated lncRNAs by RNA sequencing and validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH). The clinical significance of FLJ was evaluated in a collected cancer cohort. Functional loss assays were performed to assess the effects of FLJ on CRPC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The regulatory mechanism of FLJ was investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC), qRT-PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. RESULTS: FLJ is highly expressed in CRPC and is associated with higher stages and Gleason scores in prostate cancer. FLJ is strongly positively correlated with androgen receptor (AR), which acts as a transcription factor and directly binds to the FLJ promoter region to enhance its transcription. Knockdown of FLJ inhibits CRPC cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to castration and enzalutamide (ENZA) in vitro. Mechanistically, FLJ promotes castration resistance in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting AR nuclear import and cytoplasmic protein degradation, thereby activating the androgen-independent AR signaling pathway. Importantly, in vivo experiments showed that FLJ knockdown inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the therapeutic effect of ENZA. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a novel regulatory mechanism by which lncRNA FLJ promotes CRPC progression. Sustained AR activation in CRPC acts as a transcription factor to upregulate FLJ expression. FLJ circumvents the traditional androgen-dependent survival mechanism by inhibiting AR nuclear entry and cytoplasmic protein degradation, thereby activating the AR signaling pathway. Targeting the FLJ-AR signaling axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer."
40032681,N-glycosylation of GSTO1 promotes cervical cancer migration and invasion through JAK/STAT3 pathway activation.,"Protein glycosylation is strongly associated with tumor progression. Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) is a member of the glutathione S-transferase family. The significance of GSTO1 N-glycosylation in the progression of cervical cancer (CC) has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of GSTO1 N-glycosylation in CC progression. We employed immunohistochemistry to detect the relative expression of evaluating the link between GSTO1 in CC and benign tissues and the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in CC patients.In vitro and in vivo experiments to detect CC cell proliferation or metastatic ability after GSTO1 downregulation. NetNGly1.0 Server database predicts potential N-glycosylation modification sites of GSTO1 (Asn55, Asn135, Asn190). Investigating GSTO1 N-glycosylation's function in cellular migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we mutated the N-glycosylation sites of GSTO1 through lentivirus-based insertional mutagenesis. Detection of signalling pathways associated with N-glycosylation-modified GSTO1 by enrichment analysis and Western blot. Compared to normal cervical tissue, CC tissue showed significantly higher GSTO1 expression. Further, high GSTO1 levels were a poor predictor of OS and PFS. Both cell and animal experiments suggested that down-regulation of GSTO1 inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis. Glycosylation modification of targeted mutant GSTO1 at positions 55, 135 and 190 significantly inhibits migration and invasion of CC cells. GSTO1 N-glycosylation fixed point mutation inhibits EMT process in CC cells. Mechanistically, N-glycosylated GSTO1 promoted the expression of JAK/STAT3 pathway related markers. GSTO1 N-glycosylation is associated with CC progression and may promote EMT via JAK/STAT3 signaling."
40029246,A Polygenic Risk Score for Late Bladder Toxicity Following Radiotherapy for Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Late bladder toxicity is a concern for patients receiving prostate cancer radiotherapy and negatively impacts survivors. Few risk factors are known beyond the radiation dose and volume of bladder exposed. A polygenic risk score (PRS) could identify susceptible patients. METHODS: A PRS was built using genome-wide association results from the Radiogenomics Consortium (N=3,988), then tested in the prospective REQUITE and URWCI studies (N=2,034). The primary outcome was time-to-patient-reported gross (>/= grade 2, G2) hematuria analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Secondary outcomes were >/=G2 urinary retention and frequency. The PRS was externally validated for clinically-diagnosed irradiation cystitis in the UK Biobank (N=8,430). A gene-burden test evaluated rare coding variants. RESULTS: A 115-variant PRS was associated with significantly increased risk of >/=G2 hematuria (hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation [SD]=1.22, p=0.009) as well as urinary retention (HR-per-SD=1.18, p=0.016) and frequency (HR-per-SD=1.14, p=0.036). When binarized, men in the upper decile (PRShigh) had >2-fold increased risk of hematuria after adjusting for clinical risk factors (HR=2.12, p=0.002; Harrel's c-index 0.71 [95%CI=0.65 to 0.76]). A similar effect size was seen in the UK Biobank for clinically-diagnosed irradiation cystitis (OR=2.15, p=0.026). The burden test identified BOD1L1 as a putative novel radiosensitivity gene. CONCLUSIONS: This PRS identifies susceptible patients and could guide selection of those needing re-optimized treatment plans that spare the bladder beyond currently recommended constraints. IMPACT: PRS-guided treatment planning in radiation oncology could lower the incidence of clinically relevant bladder toxicity and reduce the impact of this outcome on prostate cancer survivors."
40027233,Genomic characterization of metastatic patterns in prostate cancer using circulating tumor DNA data from the SCRUM-Japan MONSTAR SCREEN project.,"PURPOSE: Genomic characterization of the predisposition of tumors to metastasize to specific sites has been performed in a few studies using mainly tissue-derived genomes. This nationwide prospective observational study investigated the association between genomic characteristics using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and the synchronous and metachronous metastasis of tumors to specific target organs in advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: Patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing systemic treatment were included. ctDNA was analyzed using the FoundationOne(R)Liquid CDx assay at enrollment. Associations between genomic characteristics and metastatic status were examined. RESULTS: Alterations in the genes MYC, APC, and BRCA2 and the DNA repair, MYC, and WNT pathways were associated with lung and liver metastasis. PTEN gene alterations and PI3K pathway alteration were associated with synchronous lung metastasis. RB1 gene alteration and RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway alteration were associated with synchronous liver metastasis. RB1 and BRCA2 gene alterations predicted metachronous lung metastasis, while TP53 and MYC gene alterations predicted metachronous liver metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies genomic alterations in ctDNA associated with synchronous and metachronous metastases. These findings may be clinically helpful for treating, managing, and monitoring cancer."
40026212,A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study on the Causal Relationship Between Epstein-Barr Virus Antibodies and Prostate Cancer Risk.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the correlation between four distinct Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies (EA-D, EBNA-1, VCA-p18, and ZEBRA) and the likelihood of developing prostate cancer (PCa) using the Mendelian Randomization (MR) technique. The primary objective is to determine whether a causal relationship exists between these EBV antibodies and prostate cancer. METHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for EBV antibodies were sourced from the UK Biobank cohort, and prostate cancer data were obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium, which includes 79148 cases and 61106 controls. Univariable Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations, while reverse Mendelian Randomization was employed to assess causality. Additionally, Multivariable Mendelian Randomization analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors. RESULTS: Univariable MR analysis revealed significant associations between EBV EA-D (OR = 1.084, 95% CI = 1.012-1.160, IVW_P = 0.021) and EBNA-1 (OR = 1.086, 95% CI = 1.025-1.150, IVW_P = 0.005) antibodies and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Reverse MR analysis did not establish a causal relationship. Multivariable MR analysis identified the EBV EBNA-1 antibody as an independent risk factor for prostate cancer (OR = 1.095, 95% CI = 1.042-1.151, IVW_P = 0.00036). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the association between EBV antibody levels, particularly EBNA-1, and prostate cancer risk, suggesting EBNA-1 as an independent risk factor. Future research is needed to elucidate the biological pathways linking EBV antibody levels to prostate cancer. These insights could be instrumental in developing targeted prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions for prostate cancer."
40025015,Dissecting tumor cell programs through group biology estimation in clinical single-cell transcriptomics.,"With the growth of clinical cancer single-cell RNA sequencing studies, robust differential expression methods for case/control analyses (e.g., treatment responders vs. non-responders) using gene signatures are pivotal to nominate hypotheses for further investigation. However, many commonly used methods produce a large number of false positives, do not adequately represent the patient-specific hierarchical structure of clinical single-cell RNA sequencing data, or account for sample-driven confounders. Here, we present a nonparametric statistical method, BEANIE, for differential expression of gene signatures between clinically relevant groups that addresses these issues. We demonstrate its use in simulated and real-world clinical datasets in breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma. BEANIE outperforms existing methods in specificity while maintaining sensitivity, as demonstrated in simulations. Overall, BEANIE provides a methodological strategy to inform biological insights into unique and shared differentially expressed gene signatures across different tumor states, with utility in single-study, meta-analysis, and cross-validation across cell types."
40024836,"A retrospective analysis of tissue, liquid, and germline testing in Hispanic and non-Hispanic men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.","INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of cancer mortality among American men, with significant racial and ethnic disparities. Hispanic Americans (HAs) are underrepresented in PCa genomic studies despite comprising a large portion of cancer diagnoses. By comparing the frequency of common PCa mutations between HA and non-Hispanics (NHs), we aim to continue understanding the drivers of disparities in this underrepresented population. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 111 metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma patients with 313 tissue, liquid, and germline genomic sample results from patient blood at the University of Arizona Cancer Center (2015-2023). Patients were categorized by ethnicity into HAs and NHs. We assessed de-identified demographic, pathological, clinical, and genomic data. Continuous and categorical variables determined statistical significance were evaluated using t-tests or Kruskal-Wallis Rank sum tests and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, respectively (P < 0.05). Time-to-event data was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Methods. RESULTS: Of the 111 patients included HAs represented 41%. HAs had higher median PSA levels at the time of diagnosis (148.5 ng/ml vs. 52.6 ng/ml, P = 0.024), more advanced pathological disease stages, including T4 (36% vs. 15%), and M1c (37.8% vs. 13.6%), less time to first-line treatment (1 vs 2 months, P </= 0.01), and higher median survival time from first-line to second-line treatment (23 vs 13 months, P < 0.01). TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and TMB-High (>10) mutations were more common in HAs (36% vs. 6%, P = 0.0009; 20% vs. 3%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our study shows a more advanced clinical presentation of HAs PCa compared to NHs. Furthermore, significant genomic differences in PCa between HAs and NHWs, particularly in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and TMB-High mutations, highlight the need for early detection and personalized treatment options. Addressing treatment disparities and expanding genomic research in HAs are crucial for developing effective interventions in this underrepresented population."
40024452,D-bait: A siDNA for regulation of DNA-protein kinases against DNA damage and its implications in cancer.,"siDNA fragments, also called Dbait and Pbait, are small DNA oligonucleotides of 30-32 base pairs that cause impairment in DNA repair pathways. Like siRNA and miRNA molecules, which lead to the degradation of mRNA molecules through the Argonaute and Drosha machinery, respectively, Dbait molecules act as false DNA damage signals and trigger and exhaust the DNA repair machinery. In normal cells with no significant DNA damage, the influence of these molecules is negligible. However, in cancer, when there is heavy DNA damage due to replication and anticancer therapies, the cancer cell is heavily dependent on DNA repair proteins to keep the genome intact and limit breaks. This phenomenon primarily occurs during radiation therapy, as significant DNA damage surpasses several DNA repair mechanisms, causing an accumulation of unrepaired lesions and ultimately leading to cell death. This review explores the therapeutic capacity of siDNA molecules in cancer treatment by stimulating the repair mechanisms in cells that depend on DNA repair pathways. For aggressive malignancies such as glioblastoma, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer, the use of siDNA as a radiosensitizer, especially when combined with other treatments, increases the vulnerability of tumor cells to radiation-induced DNA damage, hence potentially enhancing therapy results."
40022828,Air pollution and prostate cancer: Unraveling the connection through network toxicology and machine learning.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, air pollution has been demonstrated to be associated with the occurrence of various diseases. This study aims to explore the potential association between air pollutants and prostate cancer (PCa) and to identify key genes that may play a critical bridging role in this process. METHODS: This study utilized multiple online databases to obtain relevant target genes associated with air pollutants and PCa. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and visualization were conducted for the intersecting genes, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analyses to explore potential mechanisms. Subsequently, the best predictive model was selected through a combination of 108 machine learning algorithms. A prognostic model was constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model in conjunction with Lasso regression model, and its performance was validated in four external datasets. Finally, molecular docking analysis was conducted to investigate the interaction between key genes and air pollutants. RESULTS: Seven common air pollutants (benzene, SO(2), NO, CO, NO(2), toluene, and O(3)) were selected for analysis, and 48 intersecting targets related to PCa were identified. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses revealed that these targets are primarily involved in regulating biological processes such as apoptosis, carcinogenesis, and cell proliferation. Based on machine learning algorithm selection, the combination of RSF and Lasso regression was identified as the optimal predictive model, which highlighted five key genes associated with air pollutants and PCa. The model exhibited strong predictive performance across all four independent external datasets. Additionally, molecular docking analysis further confirmed the potential interactions between air pollutants and these core targets. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that HDAC6, CDK1, DNMT1, NOS3, and DPP4 play crucial roles in the process by which air pollutants influence PCa. The results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms linking air pollutants and PCa, highlighting the need for greater public awareness of air pollution issues."
40020217,Somatic Landscape of Oncogenic Variants Across the Main Cancer Subtypes in Latin America: A Narrative Review.,"Variations in somatic genetic alterations can be observed across different cancer types and diverse populations. Understanding the frequency of oncogenic variants in specific populations helps elucidate carcinogenesis and risk factors, with somatic variants often serving as treatment markers. Data regarding the somatic landscape across the main tumor subtypes in patients from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have increased recently, highlighting important differences from contrasting populations in North America, Europe, and Asia. Many of these differences have pressing implications regarding screening, risk factor management, targeted therapies, and health care policy. This review aims to synthesize the existing information on somatic oncogenic variants in patients' tumors from LAC. We included the frequency of somatic oncogenic variants of the most frequent tumors in LAC: prostate cancer, female breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer. Furthermore, we add information from tumors that are relevant in LAC because of their high incidence, specific subtypes, or aggressive phenotypes, namely gallbladder cancer, acral melanoma, and hematologic neoplasms, respectively. The data highlight distinct differences in the reported prevalences of various somatic variants across a spectrum of neoplasms. Moreover, it demonstrates that an extensive number of genetic and molecular studies have been carried out in the region, improving the level of characterization for this complex, admixed population. Nonetheless, data from many individual countries are still scarce or altogether missing, underscoring the need to establish collaborative groups to further advance progress in LAC. The need for further comprehensive research in the area should not be substituted with data from other regions as we seek to empower the choices to improve our health care outlook."
40019942,Polygenic risk scores for pan-cancer risk prediction in the Chinese population: A population-based cohort study based on the China Kadoorie Biobank.,"BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been extensively developed for cancer risk prediction in European populations, but their effectiveness in the Chinese population remains uncertain. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed 80 PRSs for the 13 most common cancers using seven schemes and evaluated these PRSs in 100,219 participants from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). The optimal PRSs with the highest discriminatory ability were used to define genetic risk, and their site-specific and cross-cancer associations were assessed. We modeled 10-year absolute risk trajectories for each cancer across risk strata defined by PRSs and modifiable risk scores and quantified the explained relative risk (ERR) of PRSs with modifiable risk factors for different cancers. More than 60% (50/80) of the PRSs demonstrated significant associations with the corresponding cancer outcomes. Optimal PRSs for nine common cancers were identified, with each standard deviation increase significantly associated with corresponding cancer risk (hazard ratios (HRs) ranging from 1.20 to 1.76). Compared with participants at low genetic risk and reduced modifiable risk scores, those with high genetic risk and elevated modifiable risk scores had the highest risk of incident cancer, with HRs ranging from 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-3.48 for cervical cancer, P = 0.020) to 8.26 (95% CI: 1.92-35.46 for prostate cancer, P = 0.005). We observed nine significant cross-cancer associations for PRSs and found the integration of PRSs significantly increased the prediction accuracy for most cancers. The PRSs contributed 2.6%-20.3%, while modifiable risk factors explained 2.3%-16.7% of the ERR in the Chinese population. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of existing evidence has facilitated the development of PRSs associated with nine common cancer risks in the Chinese population, potentially improving clinical risk assessment."
40019487,Germline-Somatic Interactions in BRCA-Associated Cancers: Unique Molecular Profiles and Clinical Outcomes Linking ATM to TP53 Synthetic Essentiality.,"BACKGROUND: Germline alterations in homologous recombination repair (gHRR) genes impact the pathogenesis, treatment options, and survival of cancer patients. However, distinct gHRR gene alterations may differentially impact treatment response and oncogenic signaling. Here we interrogated genomic and transcriptomic data and assessed clinical outcomes of patients with gHRR mutations across four BRCA-associated cancers (breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers) to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. METHODS: We assessed 24,309 patients undergoing matched tumor/normal next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing. Annotated gHRR gene variants (gBRCA1, gBRCA2, gPALB2, gATM, gCHEK2) were analyzed. Hazard ratios were used to assess survival outcomes comparing germline versus sporadic groups. Somatic alterations and their frequencies were compared across gHRR-altered groups. Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis was used to compare transcriptomic profiles. RESULTS: Somatic TP53 mutations were depleted in gATM carriers (p<0.05) across all four BRCA-associated cancers by up to 2.5-fold. Tumors with gBRCA1/2 mutations were associated with improved survival in ovarian cancer patients, and had consistent enrichment of TP53 mutations in all four cancers. gATM mutations displayed elevated p53 transcriptional activity in all four cancers, with significance reached in breast and prostate cancers (p<0.01). In breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers, gATM tumors demonstrated significantly increased inflammatory pathways (p<0.001). Finally, using gene-dependency data, we found that cell lines that were highly dependent on ATM were co-dependent on canonical p53 function. CONCLUSION: gATM-associated cancers appear to require intact p53 activity and this synthetic essentiality may be used to guide targeted therapies that perturb canonical TP53 function."
40018938,N-acetyltransferase 10 Promotes Cervical Cancer Progression Via N4-acetylation of SLC7A5 mRNA.,"INTRODUCTION: N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) mediates N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) mRNA modification and promotes malignant tumor progression. However, there has been limited research on its role in cervical cancer. This study aimed to decipher the role of NAT10 in cervical cancer. METHODS: The prognostic value of NAT10 was explored using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and immunohistochemistry of cervical cancer tissue. The biological actions of NAT10 in cervical cancer were investigated by cell proliferation, transwell, wound healing, and chicken chorioallantoic membrane assays. The therapeutic action of remodelin (a NAT10 inhibitor) was verified in a nude mouse model. Mechanistic analyses were conducted by RNA sequencing, ac4C dot blotting, acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation, quantitative PCR, and RNA stability experiments. RESULTS: NAT10 was overexpressed in cervical carcinoma and its overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. NAT10 knockout impaired proliferative and metastatic potentials of cervical cancer cells, while its overexpression had the opposite effects. Remodelin impaired cervical cancer proliferation in vivo and in vitro. NAT10 acetylated solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) enhanced mRNA stability to regulate SLC7A5 expression. CONCLUSIONS: NAT10 exerts a critical role in cervical cancer progression via acetylating SLC7A5 mRNA and could represent a key prognostic and therapeutic target in cervical cancer."
40018753,"The association between overall, healthy, and unhealthy plant-based diet indexes and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.","Background: recent dietary guidelines recommend a diet that mainly includes plant-based foods and a moderate amount of animal products. Therefore, we hypothesized that plant-based diet indices (overall plant-based diet index (oPDI), healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI)) might be associated with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Methods: a systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases until December 2024. Meta-analysis was performed utilizing random-effects models to calculate relative risk (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: from 436 initial records, 25 prospective studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings of our study indicated a modest inverse association between the adherence to oPDI and risk of all-cause mortality (RR [95% CI]: 0.89 [0.83-0.94]; n = 15 studies) as well as mortality related to cardiovascular diseases, chronic heart disease, and total cancer. Also, adherence to hPDI was found to reduce risk of all-cause (RR [95% CI]: 0.86 [0.82-0.90]; n = 21 studies), cardiovascular disease, chronic heart disease, total-cancer, and prostate cancer mortality, whereas uPDI was associated with higher risk of all-cause (RR [95% CI]: 1.20 [1.13-1.27]; n = 19 studies), cardiovascular disease, chronic heart disease, and total-cancer mortality. Our dose-response meta-analysis showed a monotonic inverse association between adherence to oPDI and hPDI and a positive linear association between adherence to uPDI and risk of all-cause mortality. Conclusion: our findings highlight the importance of evaluating the quality of plant-based foods as either healthy or unhealthy in relation to the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality."
40018050,Comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted role of ITGAV in digestive system cancer progression and immune infiltration.,"BACKGROUND: Digestive system cancers are among the most common malignancies, exhibiting consistently high incidence and mortality rates, yet effective detection and treatment targets remain limited. Integrin alphav (ITGAV, CD51) is a significant member of the integrin family, widely recognized for its role in mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, as well as intracellular signaling. In recent years, ITGAV has been found to have significantly elevated expression in multiple tumors, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma, and was considered to be a key component in various stages of tumor progression. However, no systematic digestive system cancer analysis has been conducted to explore its function in prognosis, diagnosis, and immunology. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing and clinical data of samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), cBioPortal, TIMER and TISIDB databases. Bioinformatics methods were employed to investigate the potential oncogenicity of ITGAV, focusing specifically on the analysis of its prognosis, diagnostic value, and immune infiltration level of ITGAV in digestive system cancers. In addition, GO, KEGG, and PPI network analysis revealed the biological functions and related signaling pathways related to ITGAV. Finally, the role of ITGAV in regulating cancer progression was experimentally verified using hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer as examples. RESULTS: We found that ITGAV was highly expressed in multiple digestive system cancers. In addition, high expression of ITGAV was closely associated with poor prognosis and showed potential for early diagnosis. Enrichment of pathways related to extracellular matrix organizing processes and tumor migratory movements was identified. In vitro, results showed that the knockdown of ITGAV significantly inhibited the migratory movement ability of hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer cells, while its overexpression significantly promoted the migration of the above cells. Finally, immunoassays showed a significant correlation between ITGAV expression and the infiltration level of various immune cells, further clarifying the critical role of ITGAV in the tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSION: Our results elucidated the importance of ITGAV in the prognostic assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted immunotherapy of digestive system cancers, and revealed its multifaceted role in regulating cancer progression."
40016871,C-X-C Motif Ligand 1 Induces Cell Migration by Upregulating ICAM-1 Expression by Activating PI3K/Akt and NF-kappaB Signaling Pathway in Liver Cancer.,"Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC is a malignant tumor that can lead to intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is involved in cancer metastasis. ICAM-1 enhances cell-cell interactions by promoting adhesion and facilitating cell movement within the extracellular matrix. Moreover, ICAM-1 is more abundant in cancerous hepatocytes than in non-cancerous ones. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) is found in diverse cancers, including melanoma, breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and prostate. Several studies show a correlation between CXCL1 overexpression and poor prognosis in cancer. CXCL1 has been identified as a candidate gene that could function as a clinically relevant biomarker in HCC. However, the role of CXCL1 in cancer metastasis in HCC is poorly delineated. In this study, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database analysis revealed a positive correlation between CXCL1 level and the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. CXCL1 treatment facilitates cell movement through inducing ICAM-1 expression. The Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in CXCL1-regulated ICAM-1 production and cell motility. Thus, CXCL1 represents a promising therapeutic target for treating metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma."
40015646,Prostate Ductal Adenocarcinoma Revisited: Clinicopathological and Genomic Characterization Identifies Heterogenous Group of Diseases with Implications for Patient Management.,"Prostate ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an aggressive subtype of prostate adenocarcinoma (PA). It can be found either in the peripheral zone, typically associated with acinar PA, or centrally in or around the verumontanum as a urethral polyp. Whether centrally occurring PDAs are biologically and genetically different compared with peripheral PDA remains unknown. Thirty-five PDAs diagnosed on resection specimens were categorized into 3 groups based on PDA location (central [urethra] involvement only [PDA-C], both central and peripheral involvement [PDA-C&P], peripheral involvement only [PDA-P]) and analyzed for clinicopathological, genomic characteristics, and outcomes. Targeted next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing with full exon coverage of 1425 cancer-related genes was performed on 2 PDA-C, 8 PDA-C&P, and 12 PDA-P with a grossly dissectible population of viable PDA. In 11 PDA-P, the same patients' ductal and associated acinar components were sequenced separately. Of 35 PDAs, 2 (6%), 11 (31%), and 22 (63%) were PDA-C, PDA-C&P, and PDA-P, respectively. PDA-C&P compared with PDA-P presented with larger tumor size (median 45 mm vs 25 mm), % ductal component (100% vs 30%), >/= pT3 disease (100% vs 64%), visceral metastasis (36% vs 0%), and cancer-specific mortality (27% vs 0%) (P < .05) and enrichment for at least 1 DNA damage and repair (DDR)-related gene alterations (BRCA2, ATM, CDK12, ERCC2) (63% vs 8%), and PI3K pathway alterations (37% vs none). PDA-Ps were enriched in FOXA1 alterations compared with PDA-C&P (75% vs 25%) including 5 (56%) having FOXA1 mutation in only ductal components. TMPRSS2::ERG fusion was present in only 1 patient with PDA-P in both ductal and acinar components. One patient with PDA-C and 3 with PDA-C&P exhibited novel gene fusion ACPP::FGFR2 and NF1::ADAP, FGFR2::POC1B, and RB1:TTTY3, respectively. In 2 patients with PDA-C, PDA was eradicated in transurethral resection with no residual disease in follow-up radical prostatectomy. PDA-C lacked alterations in DDR genes. Our findings suggest that PDAs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Understanding the heterogeneity of PDA is critically important in determining its biological potential and facilitating optimal patient management."
40013766,Genomic features of bladder neuroendocrine carcinoma with composite histology.,"Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy derived from multiple body parts, with the urogenital organs being the second-largest extrapulmonary sites. The detailed mechanism of bladder NEC pathogenesis remains unknown. We reviewed data from 23 patients diagnosed with NEC from urogenital organs (bladder and prostate) and conducted targeted sequencing of 523 cancer-related genes, focusing on bladder NEC. While 14 cases featured a pure NEC histology, the remaining nine cases included NEC histology mixed with other tumors, such as urothelial carcinoma (UC) or adenocarcinoma. Median overall survival in the entire cohort was 11.1 months, and survival curves were comparable between pure NEC and NEC of mixed appearance. Major mutations detected in the NEC component were in TP53 (38%), TERT promoter (31%), PIK3CA (25%), histone-modification genes (19%), and RB1 (19%). The BARD1 frameshift variant related to homologous recombination was also detected in one patient. More than half of the patients had a high total mutational burden (TMB; >/=10), including two with a TMB >/=45. Intriguingly, at least one identical gene variant in driver genes was detected between NEC and non-NEC (UC) components in the four bladder specimens analyzed. These results highlight the possibility of shared genetic background between bladder NEC and UC. Additionally, several cases harbored druggable gene alterations as presented by TMB-high. Our presentation of the histopathological and molecular features of NEC may help clarify the underlying mechanisms and contribute to efficient treatment of the disease."
40013333,A highly sensitive screening system to evaluate the reversibility of neuroendocrine prostate cancer to prostate adenocarcinoma.,"We established a robust and sensitive androgen response element luciferase reporter assay to monitor androgen receptor (AR) activity using KUCaP13 cells, a novel human-derived treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC) cell line. A high-throughput screening using a chemical library to identify potential compounds that induce AR re-expression in KUCaP13 cells revealed 30 candidate molecules potentially enhancing luciferase luminescence; however, subsequent validation steps demonstrated these signals to be false-positives. Despite not achieving the goal of AR re-expression, this study stands as a significant proof-of-concept for the application of high-throughput screening approaches in t-NEPC research."
40013148,A remarkable and durable response to tislelizumab treatment of an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma without targetable genomic alterations: a case report.,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of approximately 3 to 4 months. In this report, we present a case involving a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with ATC, who experienced swift local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis following radical thyroidectomy. Comprehensive Sanger sequencing of the resected tumor tissue revealed no mutations in the TERT promoter or the BRAF V600E gene. The patient exhibited rapid recurrence post-surgery and was deemed unsuitable for immediate surgical intervention. The patient was unable to tolerate chemotherapy; therefore, radiotherapy was administered initially to prevent airway compression resulting from disease progression. During the course of radiotherapy, pulmonary metastasis developed, yet the patient remained intolerant to both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a high expression of PD-L1. Whole exome sequencing (WES) indicated a tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 2.98 mut/Mb, microsatellite stability (MSS), and identified 10 missense mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, and 1 frameshift insertion. However, none of these mutations have corresponding targeted therapies. Consequently, we administered tislelizumab as an immunotherapeutic intervention. The patient exhibited significant regression in cervical metastatic lymph nodes and pulmonary metastatic tumors, achieving a sustained remission lasting 14 months, culminating in complete remission, without experiencing any adverse events related to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This case demonstrates the efficacy of second-line monotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for ATC in a patient unable to tolerate chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic anlotinib treatment, thereby offering a viable treatment strategy for ATC patients."
40011853,RhoB regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation and docetaxel sensitivity via the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.,"Docetaxel is a widely used first-line treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). RhoB, a member of the Rho GTPase family, plays a major role in prostate cancer metastasis by modulating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It is crucial in regulating cytoskeletal reassembly, cell migration, focal adhesion (FA) dynamics. To investigate RhoB's function in prostate cancer, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique was utilized to knock out the RhoB gene in prostate cancer cells. Successful gene editing was confirmed by using T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assays and Sanger sequencing. Knocking out RhoB enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the IC50 value of docetaxel in RhoB-knockout PC-3 cells. This suggests increased sensitivity to docetaxel. Furthermore, RhoB knockout prompted the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, effects that were reversed upon RhoB overexpression. Interestingly, RhoB status did not significantly influence the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells. RNA sequencing of PC-3 cells with either overexpressed or knock-out RhoB revealed that RhoB regulates pathways involved in FA, ECM receptor interaction, and PI3K-AKT signaling. These pathways directly influence the EMT process, cell migration, and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Notably, RhoB overexpression activated PI3K-AKT signaling when PC-3 cells were treated with low concentration of DTXL (50 nM, 72 h). This activation reduced DTXL's cytotoxicity, suggesting may confer chemoresistance via PI3K-AKT pathway activation."
40010988,Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) as a Data Analysis Method Identifying Potential Hematological Parameters for Early Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The present study explored the use of Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) to analyze hematological parameters for distinguishing potential development and progression of cervical cancer. Specifically, we aimed to identify significant biomarkers capable of differentiating atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) from cervical cancer-negative and advanced conditions such as cervical adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hematological and biochemical data were collected from patients and analyzed using data-mining algorithms available in WEKA. The random forest algorithm was employed to identify patterns among key hematological and biochemical biomarkers, alongside one-way analysis of variance to determine significant alterations in these parameters across cancer-negative, ASC-US, LSIL and adenocarcinoma groups. RESULTS: Random forest was the classifier model that demonstrated superior performance metrics with high recall (1.000) and accuracy (0.843), Matthews correlation coefficient (0.510) and area under the curve (0.708), effectively identifying significant patterns within the datasets. One-way analysis of variance indicated significant alterations in red and white blood cell counts, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and other white blood cell parameters between cancer-negative, ASC-US, LSIL and adenocarcinoma, emphasizing the role of hematological parameters in identifying progression risk. CONCLUSION: The consistency in conclusions drawn from data mining and statistical analyses highlight the utility of hematological parameters as potential non-invasive biomarkers for cervical cancer screening and progression monitoring. These findings suggest that integrating machine-learning algorithms, particularly random forest, with hematological analysis might enhance early diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes for patients with cervical abnormalities."
40009323,CTHRC1 expresses in cancer-associated fibroblasts and is associated with resistance to anti-androgen therapy in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: CTHRC1 overexpresses in prostate cancer and is associated with the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. However, the roles and mechanisms of CTHRC1 expression in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment outcomes remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the expression and gene function of CTHRC1 in prostate cancer, investigate the prognostic value and potential effect in the treatment of prostate cancer. METHODS: Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses were used to evaluate the expression of CTHRC1 in prostate cancer. All data used in the study were obtained from publicly available sources to ensure transparency. Study enrolled 1999 cases of prostate cancer and 531 normal controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing profile included 62,995 cells from seven prostate primary tumors. CTHRC1 expression and prognosis analyses were conducted with these samples and verified by immunohistochemical staining. CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the tumor immune infiltrating cells based on bulk mRNA sequencing profiles. Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC) database was used to predict IC50 to anti-androgen therapy (ADT) drugs of the samples. RESULTS: CTHRC1 expressed in prostate cancer was higher than that in normal prostate tissue, and the expression increased with the progress of prostate cancer. CTHRC1 was the risk factor of progression-free interval (PFI). CTHRC1 was positively correlated with the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Myofibroblast-like cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) were the major CTHRC1 expressers in prostate cancer. TGF-beta signaling activated in CTHRC1-positive myCAFs and was involved in TAMs polarization. Biological functions of myCAFs were enriched in hormone response and metabolism. CTHRC1 may regulate androgen receptor signaling through CCN2/CAV1/AR pathway. Moreover, ADT drug Bicalutamide and AZD3514 were less sensitive in the high CTHRC1 expression tumors. CONCLUSIONS: As a potential molecular target of ADT resistance in prostate cancer, CTHRC1 provides a new promising molecular approach for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer."
40008391,An Immunogenic Cell Death-Related Gene Signature Predicts the Prognosis and Immune Infiltration of Cervical Cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the development and progression of malignant tumors by modulating the anti-tumor immune response. However, its function in cervical cancer (CC) remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to construct an ICD-related gene signature to predict patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration in CC. METHODS: The gene expression profiles and clinical data of CC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Alas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, serving as the training and testing groups, respectively. An ICD-related gene signature was developed using the LASSO-Cox model. The expression levels of the associated ICD-related genes were evaluated using single-cell data, CC cell lines, and clinical samples in vitro. RESULTS: Two ICD-associated subtypes (cluster 1 and cluster 2) were identified through consensus clustering. Patients classified into cluster 2 demonstrated higher levels of immune cell infiltration and exhibited a more favorable prognosis. Subsequently, an ICD-related gene signature comprising 3 genes (IL1B, IFNG, and FOXP3) was established for CC. Based on the median risk score, patients in both training and testing cohorts were segregated into high-risk and low-risk groups. Further analyses indicated that the estimated risk score functioned as an independent prognostic factor for CC and influenced immune cell abundance within the tumor microenvironment. The up-regulation of the identified ICD-related genes was further validated in CC cell lines and collected clinical samples. CONCLUSION: In summary, the stratification based on ICD-related genes demonstrated strong efficacy in predicting patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration, which also provides valuable new perspectives for the diagnosis and prognosis of CC."
40008390,Integrated Bioinformatic Analyses Reveal Thioredoxin as a Putative Marker of Cancer Stem Cells and Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and recurrence; thus, removing CSCs is important for complete cancer removal. However, the mechanisms underlying CSC functions remain largely unknown, making it difficult to develop new anticancer drugs targeting CSCs. Herein, we aimed to identify novel factors that regulate stemness and predict prognosis. METHODS: We reanalyzed 2 single-cell RNA sequencing data of prostate cancer (PCa) tissues using Seurat. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to estimate CSCs and identified common upregulated genes in CSCs between these datasets. To investigate whether its expression levels change over CSC differentiation, we performed a trajectory analysis using monocle 3. In addition, GSEA helped us understand how the identified genes regulate stemness. Finally, to assess their clinical significance, we used the Cancer Genome Atlas database to evaluate their impact on prognosis. RESULTS: The expression of thioredoxin (TXN), a redox enzyme, was approximately 1.2 times higher in prostate CSCs than in PCa cells (P < 1 x 10(-10)), and TXN expression decreased over CSC differentiation. In addition, GSEA suggested that intracellular signaling pathways, including MYC, may be involved in stemness regulation by TXN. Furthermore, TXN expression correlated with poor prognosis (P < .05) in PCa patients with high stemness. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited sample size in our study and the need for further in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate whether TXN functionally regulates prostate CSCs, our findings suggest that TXN may serve as a novel therapeutic target against CSCs. Moreover, TXN expression in CSCs could be a useful marker for predicting the prognosis of PCa patients."
40007440,Thermal proteome profiling and proteome analysis using high-definition mass spectrometry demonstrate modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by next-generation galeterone analog VNPP433-3beta in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Cholesterol (CHOL) homeostasis is significantly modulated in prostate cancer (PCa) suggesting an active role in PCa development and progression. Several studies indicate a strong correlation between elevated CHOL levels and increased PCa risk and severity. Inhibition of CHOL biosynthesis at different steps, including lanosterol synthase (LSS), has shown significant efficacy against both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant PCa. Earlier, we reported proteasomal degradation of androgen receptor (AR)/AR-Vs and Mnk1/2 as the primary mechanisms of action of VNPP433-3beta in inhibiting PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth. Through thermal proteome profiling, comparative proteomics and cellular thermal shift assay, we identified VNPP433-3beta's ancillary effect of lowering CHOL by binding to LSS and lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, potentially inhibiting CHOL biosynthesis in PCa cells and tumors. Additionally, in conjunction with our previously reported transcriptome analysis, proteomics reveals that VNPP433-3beta modulated upstream regulators and pathways critical for PCa stem cell maintenance and recurrence. The inhibition of CHOL biosynthesis by VNPP433-3beta reinforces its multifaceted effects in PCa across all stages, highlighting its potential as a single-agent therapy. Achieving reduced CHOL levels aligns with better treatment outcomes, further substantiating VNPP433-3beta's therapeutic potential."
40005682,The Urogenital System Microbiota: Is It a New Gamechanger in Urogenital Cancers?,"The human microbiome, which encompasses microbial communities and their genetic material, significantly influences health and disease, including cancer. The urogenital microbiota, naturally present in the urinary and genital tracts, interact with factors such as age, lifestyle, and health conditions to affect homeostasis and carcinogenesis. Studies suggest that alterations in this microbiota contribute to the development and progression of genitourinary cancers, emphasizing the concept of oncobiome, which refers to microbial genetic contributions to cancer. Similarly, gut microbiota can influence hormone levels and systemic inflammation, impacting cancers such as cervical and prostate cancer. Advanced studies indicate that microbial communities in genitourinary cancers have distinct profiles that may serve as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Dysbiosis of the urinary microbiota correlates with bladder and kidney cancer. Additionally, gut microbiota influence the effectiveness of cancer treatments. However, further research is necessary to clarify causality, the role of microbial metabolites, and hormonal regulation. The aim of this review is to understand that these dynamics present opportunities for innovative cancer diagnostics and therapies, highlighting the need for integration of microbiology, oncology, and genomics to explore the role of microbiota in genitourinary cancers. For this, a comprehensive search of relevant databases was conducted, applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify studies examining the association between microbiota and urogenital cancers. Research into the mechanisms by which microbiota influence urogenital cancers may pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving patient outcomes."
40004500,The Relationship of the Pathogenic Variant rs721048 in the Intron of the EHBP1 Gene with the Development of Prostate Cancer and Colorectal Cancer in the Kazakh Population.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common oncological diseases among men. Up to 20% of PC cases are associated with hereditary risks or syndromes. The impact of common variants, particularly EHBP1 c.1185+30064G>A rs721048, on developing PC and other malignancies remains unclear. There are also no data on the frequency of this variant in the Kazakh population or its association with PC, nor its potential connection with other malignancies, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We utilized the TruSight Cancer Sequencing Panel to assess pathological genomic variants in 72 male patients with histologically verified aggressive PC and 119 patients of Kazakh nationality with histologically confirmed CRC compared to the control group. RESULTS: A variant in the intron of the EHBP1 gene c.1185+30064G>A rs721048 was identified in 18 patients (25%) out of 72 with PC, while in the control group of 41 healthy males, the rs721048 variant was found in only 4 (9.8%) individuals. In the CRC group, rs721048 was detected in 17 cases (14.2%) and eight control individuals (10%). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the EHBP1 c.1185+30064G>A rs721048 variant in the PC group was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in healthy males of Kazakh nationality. Identifying EHBP1 c.1185+30064G>A among the male population of Kazakhstan will help form the high-risk groups for PC to prevent the development of malignant neoplasms. The presence of rs721048 was not significantly associated with the risk of developing CRC in our study."
40004477,Impact of UV-Irradiated Mesoporous Titania Nanoparticles (mTiNPs) on Key Onco- and Tumor Suppressor microRNAs of PC3 Prostate Cancer Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Mesoporous titanium dioxide nanoparticles (mTiNPs) are known for their chemical stability, non-toxicity, antimicrobial and anticancer effects, as well as for their photocatalytic properties. When this material is subjected to UV radiation, its electronic structure shifts, and during that process, reactive oxygen species are generated, which in turn exert apoptotic events on the cancer cells. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of UV-irradiated mTiNPs on prostate cancer (PCa) cell line PC3 with the aim of demonstrating that the interaction between UV-light and mTiNPs positively impacts the nanomaterial's cytotoxic efficiency. Moreover, we assessed the differential expression of key oncomiRs and tumor suppressor (TS) miRNAs, as well as their associated target genes, in cells undergoing this treatment. METHODS: PBS-suspended mTiNPs exposed to 290 nm UV light were added at different concentrations to PC3 cells. Cell viability was determined after 24 h with a crystal violet assay. Then, the obtained IC(50) concentration of UV-nanomaterial was applied to a new PC3 cell culture, and the expression of a set of miRNAs and selected target genes was evaluated via qRT-PCR. RESULTS: The cells exposed to photo-activated mTiNPs required 4.38 times less concentration of the nanomaterial than the group exposed to non-irradiated mTiNPs to achieve the half-maximal inhibition, demonstrating an improved cytotoxic performance of the UV-irradiated mTiNPs. Moreover, the expression of miR-18a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-221-5p was downregulated after the application of UV-mTiNPs, while TS miR-200a-5p and miR-200b-5p displayed an upregulated expression. Among the miRNA target genes, PTEN was found to be upregulated after the treatment, while BCL-2 and TP53 were underexpressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our cytotoxic outcomes coincided with previous reports performed in other cancer cell lines, strongly suggesting UV-irradiated mTiNPs as a promising nano-therapeutic approach against PCa. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report exploring the impact of UV-irradiated mTiNPs on key onco- and TS microRNAs in PCa cells."
40002724,An Integrated Approach Utilizing Single-Cell and Bulk RNA-Sequencing for the Identification of a Mitophagy-Associated Genes Signature: Implications for Prognostication and Therapeutic Stratification in Prostate Cancer.,"Introduction: Prostate cancer, notably prostate adenocarcinoma (PARD), has high incidence and mortality rates. Although typically resistant to immunotherapy, recent studies have found immune targets for prostate cancer. Stratifying patients by molecular subtypes may identify those who could benefit from immunotherapy. Methods: We used single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from GEO and TCGA databases. We characterized the tumor microenvironment at the single-cell level, analyzing cell interactions and identifying fibroblasts linked to mitophagy. Target genes were narrowed down at the bulk transcriptome level to construct a PARD prognosis prediction nomogram. Unsupervised consensus clustering classified PARD into subtypes, analyzing differences in clinical features, immune infiltration, and immunotherapy. Furthermore, the cellular functions of the genes of interest were verified in vitro. Results: We identified ten cell types and 160 mitophagy-related single-cell differentially expressed genes (MR-scDEGs). Strong interactions were observed between fibroblasts, endothelial cells, CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells. Fibroblasts linked to mitophagy were divided into six subtypes. Intersection of DEGs from three bulk datasets with MR-scDEGs identified 26 key genes clustered into two subgroups. COX regression analysis identified seven prognostic key genes, enabling a prognostic nomogram model. High and low-risk groups showed significant differences in clinical features, immune infiltration, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity. In prostate cancer cell lines, CAV1, PALLD, and ITGB8 are upregulated, while CLDN7 is downregulated. Knockdown of PALLD significantly inhibits the proliferation and colony-forming ability of PC3 and DU145 cells, suggesting the important roles of this gene in prostate cancer progression. Conclusions: This study analyzed mitophagy-related genes in PARD, predicting prognosis and aiding in subtype identification and immunotherapy response analysis. This approach offers new strategies for treating prostate cancer with specific molecular subtypes and helps develop potential biomarkers for personalized medicine strategies."
40002690,"Comprehensive Analysis Reveals Midnolin as a Potential Prognostic, Therapeutic, and Immunological Cancer Biomarker.","Background/Objectives: MIDN (midnolin) is newly discovered method for critically regulating a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation pathway. This study aims to examine the expression, prognostic value, genomic changes, interacting proteins, methylation status, and correlations with the tumor immune microenvironment of MIDN in various cancers. Methods: The GTEx, Depmap, GEPIA2, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases are applied to evaluate the MIDN level in tumor and normal tissues and the MIDN prognostic value in cancers. The genetic alterations of MIDN in cancers are investigated using the cBioPortal database. The STRING, GeneMANIA, DAVID, and Human Protein Atlas are harnessed to identify and analyze MIDN-interacted proteins. The Sangerbox 3.0 platform (a pan-cancer analysis module) is used to measure the correlations between the MIDN level and the tumor immune microenvironment, stemness, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutational burden, immune checkpoint genes, and RNA modification genes. Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting assays were used to evaluate the biological roles of MIDN in breast and gastric cancer cells. Results: MIDN expression was dysregulated in many cancers and associated with prognosis in several cancers, such as esophageal cancer. MIDN was mutated in 1.7% of cancers, and deep deletion was the dominant mutation type. NR4A1, PSMC1, and EGR1 were selected as MIDN-interacted proteins, and these four molecules were co-expressed in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, urothelial cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer. MIDN expression was significantly correlated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, B cell, macrophage, neutrophil, and DC both in prostate adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. The MIDN level was correlated with several immune checkpoint genes, such as VEGFA, and RNA modification genes such as YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and YTHDC1 in cancers. Furthermore, in breast cancer cells, the downregulation of MIDN suppressed the colony formation abilities and lessened cell-cycle-associated and stemness-associated genes; in gastric cancer, the knockdown of MIDN diminished the mRNA levels of Nanog and LDHA. Strikingly, silence of MIDN upregulated FTO protein expression in both breast and gastric cancer cells. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the expression, prognostic value, mutation status, interacting proteins, methylation status, and correlations with the tumor immune microenvironment of MIDN. MIDN will be developed as a potential therapeutic target and a prognosis biomarker."
40002239,TP53 Deficiency in the Natural History of Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men, with advanced stages posing significant treatment challenges due to high morbidity and mortality. Among genetic alterations, TP53 mutations are among the most prevalent in cancers and are strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes and therapeutic resistance. This review investigates the role of TP53 mutations in prostate cancer progression, prognosis, and therapeutic development. A comprehensive analysis of preclinical and clinical studies was conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, clinical implications, and potential therapeutic approaches associated with TP53 alterations in prostate cancer. TP53 mutations are highly prevalent in advanced stages, contributing to genomic instability, aggressive tumor phenotypes, and resistance to standard treatments. Emerging evidence supports the utility of liquid biopsy techniques, such as circulating tumor DNA analysis, for detecting TP53 mutations, providing prognostic value and facilitating early intervention strategies. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting TP53 have shown promise in preclinical settings, but their clinical efficacy requires further validation. Overall, TP53 mutations represent a critical biomarker for disease progression and therapeutic response in prostate cancer. Advances in detection methods and targeted therapies hold significant potential to improve outcomes for patients with TP53-mutated prostate cancer. Further research is essential to integrate TP53-based strategies into routine clinical practice."
40001606,Omics Investigations of Prostate Cancer Cells Exposed to Simulated Microgravity Conditions.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the most diagnosed cancer in males across the globe. Following the formation of metastasis, PC is linked to a notable decline in both prognosis and survival rates. Three-dimensional multicellular spheroids (MCSs) of a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line were generated in a three-day simulated microgravity environment (s-microg) to serve as a model for metastasis and to derive transcriptional and epigenetic PC candidates from molecular biological changes. With an FDR of 10(-3), we detected the most differentially expressed genes in the two comparisons' adherent cells (AD) to MCSs (N = 751 genes) and 1g control cells to MCSs (N = 662 genes). In these two comparisons, genes related to cell cycle, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and extracellular space were consistently found to be significantly enriched in GO annotations. Furthermore, at a 5% FDR significance level, we were able to identify 11,090 genome-wide differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and one differentially methylated region in the SRMS gene in the 1g vs. AD comparison, as well as an additional 10,797 DMPs in the 1g vs. MCSs comparison. Finally, we identified five s-microg-related positive enrichments of transcription factor binding sites for AR, IRF1, IRF2, STAT1, STAT2, and FOXJ3 close to the DMPs."
40000514,Bio-fabricated silver nanoparticles: therapeutic evaluation as a potential nanodrug against cervical and liver cancer cells.,"Nanobiotechnology has grown rapidly and is now widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of modern diseases. Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are eco-friendly, cost-effective, biocompatible route, and have biomedical properties at minimal concentrations. In the present study extract of cyanobacterium (Anabaena variabilis) was utilized to synthesize facile, reliable AgNPs, further biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by physicochemical techniques. The atomic force microscope study confirmed the shape of AgNPs while the scanning electron microscopy study revealed 17 to 35 nm in the size range. The zeta potential value of -19.5 mV demonstrated the repulsion effect between the particles, which prevents their aggregations while the heating stability of AgNPs was confirmed by Thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis. Another important characteristic, such as elemental constituent of AgNPs was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and was observed 94.24, 95.19, 97.06, and 99.34% of silver present in their respective concentrations of AgNPs. In vitro cytotoxicity of AgNPs was screened on HeLa, SiHa, (Cervical carcinoma), and HepG2 (Human hepatocellular carcinoma), cell lines. To evaluate the biocompatibility of AgNPs immortalized human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell line was used. The IC(50) values of AgNPs are were observed as 23.76 +/- 2.4 microg/mL, 11.21 +/- 1.7 microg/mL, and 22.27 +/- 1.8 microg/mL against HeLa, SiHa and HepG2 cell lines respectively. AgNPs demonstrated the biocompatible nature against HEK-293 cells, Normal cell line (HEK-293) cytotoxicity results showed exhibited >/= 95% cell viability at all the concentrations. During the DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining study IC(50) dose of AgNPs on cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, and HepG2) showed nuclear morphological alterations which indicate the DNA damage and apoptosis in cancer cells. AgNPs treated cancer cells increased the cells number in the S phase while decreased the number of cells in the G0-G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in all three cancer cells compared to the control."
39999729,"Identification of the specific characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer: Immune status, hub genes and treatment.","Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) marks the advanced phase of prostate malignancy, manifested through two principal subtypes: castration-resistant adenocarcinoma (CRPC-adeno) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). This study aims to identify unique central regulatory genes, assess the immunological landscape, and explore potential therapeutic strategies specifically tailored to NEPC. We discovered 1444 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) distinguishing between the two cancer types and identified 12 critical hub genes. Notably, CHST1, MPPED2, and RIPPLY3 emerged as closely associated with the immune cell infiltration pattern, establishing them as top candidates. Prognostic analysis highlighted the potential critical roles of CHST1 and MPPED2 in prostate cancer development, findings corroborated through in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, we validated the functions and expression levels of CHST1, MPPED2, and RIPPLY3 in NEPC using cell lines, animal models and human tissues. In the final step, we found that imatinib might be the drug specific to NEPC, which was further confirmed by in vitro cell assay. Our results revealed the clinical characteristics, molecular features, immune cell infiltration pattern in CRPC-adeno and NEPC, and identified and confirmed CHST1, MPPED2, and RIPPLY3 as the critical genes in the development in prostate cancer and NEPC. We also predicted and validated imatinib as the potential specific drugs to NEPC."
39995874,Differentiation of high risk prostate cancer with a facile urinary exosome detection workflow.,"Clear differentiation of high-grade and clinically insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) is critical for clinical decision-making. Here, we developed a proprietary urinary exosome isolation approach (EVLatch) and established a facile diagnostic workflow. We discovered that EEF1A1 levels, abundantly expressed on urinary exosomes, positively correlate to urinary exosome counts irrespective of source and collection time and demonstrated that EEF1A1 enables in-assay quantification of urinary exosomes. Importantly, a prostate cancer urinary EVLatch-based artificial intelligence diagnostics (PURE-AID) classification system utilizing PCA3, HOXC6, and DLX1 as targets with SPDEF for reference and EEF1A1 for quality checking, trained on 271 patients, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 in the test set of 351 patients. Combination of PURE-AID with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and age increases AUROC to 0.80 and reduces 54.3% of unnecessary biopsies with 86.8% sensitivity. Our study provides a new classification system for differentiating high-grade PCa in a workflow- and patient-friendly manner."
39995416,Exploring the multi-targeted mechanism of Saikosaponin A in prostate cancer treatment: a network pharmacology and molecular docking approach.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the prevalent malignant tumors among men. It can progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is significantly more challenging to treat. Saikosaponin A (SSA), a triterpenoid saponin extracted from the genus Bupleurum, exerts numerous pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic effects. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of SSA in prostate cancer treatment remains elusive. METHODS: In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to identify relevant targets from drug- and disease-related databases, and intersections were analyzed using Venny2.1 to construct a Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) interaction network. Next, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to elucidate associated biological functions and signaling pathways. Meanwhile, molecular docking between core targets and SSA was performed using Autodock software. Lastly, in vitro experiments were performed for validation. RESULTS: A least of four key targets, namely BCL2 apoptosis regulator (BCL2), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were identified in this study, and molecular docking analyses revealed that SSA stably binds to these targets. Moreover, the results of in vitro experiments revealed that SSA significantly inhibited the proliferative and migratory abilities of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, SSA also induced G1-phase blockade and apoptosis in PC3 cells, further highlighting its potential role in prostate cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that SSA exerts anti-tumorigenic effects in prostate cancer by targeting multiple pathways, laying a theoretical reference for its use as a therapeutic candidate for prostate cancer."
39994764,Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization identifies causal plasma proteins in prostate cancer development.,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of prostate cancer remained elusive, whether plasma protein levels are associated with prostate cancer is still unknown. METHODS: We have performed Mendelian randomization analyses to calculate the causal effects of plasma proteins on the risk of prostate cancer in the PRACTICAL consortium dataset using cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) variants as instrumental variables for plasma proteins, and cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for the circulating gene expression. We also replicated the findings in the FinnGen consortium. RESULTS: Genetically proxied levels of 4 plasma proteins (CREB3L4, HDGF, SERPINA3, GNPNAT1) were identified as positively correlated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, while an increase in genetically proxied levels of 5 plasma proteins (TNFRSF6B, GSK3A, EIF4B, CLIC1, SMAD2) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer in the PRACTICAL consortium. Among the identified proteins, the causal effects of six proteins including CREB3L4, HDGF, SERPINA3, TNFRSF6B, EIF4B, and SMAD2 remained significant in the replication analyses in the FinnGen consortium and when combined with meta-analyses (SMAD2: OR 0.710, 95% CI 0.578-0.873, p-value = 0.001; CREB3L4: OR 1.260, 95% CI 1.164-1.364, p-value < 0.0001; HDGF: OR 1.072, 95% CI 1.021-1.125, p-value = 0.005; SERPINA3: OR 1.138, 95% CI 1.091-1.187, p-value < 0.0001; TNFRSF6B: OR 0.656, 95% CI 0.496-0.869, p-value = 0.003; EIF4B: OR 0.701, 95% CI 0.618-0.796, p-value < 0.0001). SMAD2 and CREB3L4 gene expressions proxied with cis-expression quantitative trait loci are also significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer in both consortiums and when combined with meta-analyses (SMAD2: OR 0.787, 95% CI 0.719-0.861, p-value = 1.00 x 10(-4); CREB3L4: OR 1.219, 95% CI 1.033-1.438, p-value = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Our consistent results highlighted the important roles of plasma SMAD2 and CREB3L4 in the risk of prostate cancer. Further investigations on these proteins may reveal their potential in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer."
39994715,Prognostic assessment of cervical cancer based on biomarkers: the interaction of ERRalpha and immune microenvironment.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer poses a substantial global health challenge. Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is a central regulator of cellular energy metabolism associated with poor cancer prognosis. However, the effect of ERRalpha expression on cervical cancer prognosis and immune infiltration has not been explored. This study aims to clarify the expression pattern and role of ERRalpha in cervical cancer. METHODS: We analyzed ERRalpha expression and its clinical prognosis in cervical cancer using multiple databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). The results were further validated through immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 221 cervical cancer tissue samples. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the clinical significance of ERRalpha in cervical cancer patients. All calculations were performed using the R package. RESULTS: ERRalpha expression was significantly higher in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. High ERRalpha expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed ERRalpha as an independent prognostic factor. Additionally, ERRalpha expression correlated with various immune cell types and immune checkpoints, indicating its role in the tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: ERRalpha emerges as a promising prognostic biomarker in cervical cancer, influencing immune cell infiltration and potentially guiding personalized therapeutic approaches. Future investigations are warranted to delineate the mechanistic pathways through which ERRalpha contributes to cervical cancer progression and to assess its viability as a target for innovative immunotherapy strategies."
39994616,Identification of CSRP1 as novel biomarker for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer by the combination of clinical and functional research.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second most common malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. A critical challenge lies in accurately identifying those patients at high risk for transitioning rapidly from hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) to lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). In our study, we employed a multiomics approach involving bioinformatics analysis on datasets GSE2443 and GSE35988, along with proteomics studies, to discover that cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) expression significantly impacts the progression of HSPC. This hypothesis was substantiated through experiments using PC3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, where we conducted scratch assays and apoptosis assays, all of which confirmed CSRP1's role in suppressing tumor growth. Furthermore, we elucidated the inhibitory effect of CSRP1 on tumors by performing xenograft experiments on castrated mice models. To solidify these findings in a clinical context, we constructed a nomogram model integrating CSRP1's immunohistochemistry data and clinical parameters from an actual patient cohort with HSPC. This model revealed that low CSRP1 expression indeed promotes the advancement towards CRPC. In conclusion, the level of CSRP1 expression can serve as a valuable biomarker for clinicians to predict disease progression in their patients. It has the potential to guide personalized clinical management and decision-making strategies, thereby contributing to more effective and targeted treatment approaches for HSPC patients."
39994603,Vasectomy and prostate cancer risk: a pooled of cohort studies and Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between vasectomy and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear, with observational studies reporting inconsistent results. To clarify this ambiguity, we embarked on a comprehensive investigation comprising both a meta-analysis and a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. This dual approach aimed to thoroughly examine not only the association but also the causality between undergoing a vasectomy and the subsequent risk of PCa. METHODS: Our systematic review meticulously examined cohort studies published until January 2024, employing a random effects model for the computation of relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For MR Analysis, we leveraged aggregated data from the IEU Open GWAS database, investigating the correlation between genetic predisposition to vasectomy and PCa. We chose single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of European descent as instrumental variables (IVs) for this analysis. The primary method for calculating the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs was inverse variance weighting (IVW). Through sensitivity analysis, we confirmed the robustness of our findings. RESULTS: Our investigation synthesized data from 19 cohort studies, encompassing over four million participants. The combined analysis revealed a statistically significant link between vasectomy and an elevated risk of PCa across any grade (RR = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.05-1.14; P = 0.001; I(2) = 83.3%). This association was observed for both localized PCa (RR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; P < 0.001; I(2) = 48.8%) and advanced PCa (RR = 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13; P = 0.016; I(2) = 0%). Nonetheless, the discovery cohort MR Analysis indicated no genetic causal link between vasectomy and PCa (OR = 0.067; 95%CI = 0.002-1.535; P = 0.09). A validation set in the Finnish population confirmed the robustness of the results. This conclusion remained consistent even after controlling for variables such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and body mass index (BMI), suggesting that while a statistical association exists, the genetic evidence does not support a causal relationship. CONCLUSION: The cumulative analysis indicates a possible elevated risk of PCa in patients who have had a vasectomy. However, MR Analysis has not confirmed a direct causal link between vasectomy and PCa. This suggests that the association observed may not stem from direct causation, allowing for the continued consideration of vasectomy as a viable long-term contraceptive choice. Further research is imperative to uncover any factors that could potentially link vasectomy to an increased risk of prostate cancer, aiming to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications."
39994444,SETD1A-dependent EME1 transcription drives PARPi sensitivity in HR deficient tumour cells.,"BACKGROUND: Cells deficient in DNA repair factors breast cancer susceptibility 1/2 (BRCA1/2) or ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are sensitive to poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Building on our previous findings, we asked how the lysine methyltransferase SETD1A contributed to PARP inhibitor-mediated cell death in these contexts and determined the mechanisms responsible. METHODS: We used cervical, breast, lung and ovarian cancer cells bearing mutations in BRCA1 or ATM and depleted SETD1A using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. We assessed the effects of the PARPi Olaparib on cell viability, homologous recombination, and DNA repair. We assessed underlying transcriptional perturbations using RNAseq. We used The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA) and DepMap to investigate patient survival and cancer cell characteristics. RESULTS: Loss of SETD1A from both BRCA1-deficient and ATM-deficient cancer cells was associated with resistance to Olaparib, explained by partial restoration of homologous recombination. Mechanistically, SETD1A-dependent transcription of the crossover junction endonuclease EME1 correlated with sensitivity to Olaparib in these cells. Accordingly, when SETD1A or EME1 was lost, BRCA1 or ATM-mutated cells became resistant to Olaparib, and homologous recombination was partially restored. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of SETD1A or EME1 drives cellular resistance to Olaparib in certain genetic contexts and may help explain why patients develop resistance to PARP inhibitors in the clinic."
39993810,Characterization of the Genomic Landscape in HPV-positive Cervical and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas by Whole Genome Next Generation Sequencing.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: In this study, we provide a comprehensive characterization of HPV-positive primary cervical cancers (CC) and HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) through whole genome next-generation sequencing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, recognized as a definitive human carcinogen, is increasingly acknowledged for its role in development of human cancers. HPV-driven cervical cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, while HPV-driven head and neck cancers exhibit distinct biological and clinical characteristics. Recent data has provided convincing evidence that HPV-related cervical cancer, like HPV head and neck cancer also predict better outcomes, with viral integration patterns further predicting disease related outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed an experimental study that encompasses four pairs of HPV-positive patient samples with controls, utilizing state-of-the-art Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology including whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and virus integration. RESULTS: Multiple mutated genes, including TTN, COL6A3, and FLNA, were identified shared between CC and HNSCC. Additionally, we observed a notable proportion of pathways affected by oncogenic alterations, particularly in the RTK-RAS and NOTCH pathways, in both CC and HNSCC. Furthermore, we discovered a shared down-regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway based on transcriptome expression analysis in KEGG. We also identified RUNX2 and TFPI as sites of virus integration, and upstream as well as downstream pathway modulators, and represent potential targets for therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study showed a thorough comparison between CC and HNSCC from multiple aspects, including gene variations, oncogenic pathways, KEGG enrichment and virus integration sites. However, further studies, which involve larger patient cohorts should be undertaken to further support these findings."
39993806,"Loss of E-cadherin Activates EGFR-MEK/ERK Signaling, Promoting Cervical Cancer Progression.","BACKGROUND/AIM: This study investigated the relationship between E-cadherin down-regulation and enhanced pERK1/2 signaling in cervical cancer, evaluated their combined prognostic impact, and explored potential therapeutic targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 188 cervical cancer specimens and 300 normal cervical tissue samples using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Small interfering RNA transfection and western blotting were used to study molecular interactions in cervical cancer cell lines. RESULTS: We observed a significant inverse correlation between E-cadherin and pERK1/2 expression, as well as poor disease-free survival and overall survival. Additionally, molecular analysis indicated that E-cadherin silencing enhanced ERK signaling and promoted cancer cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that E-cadherin and pERK1/2 are crucial biomarkers for cervical cancer prognosis and their interaction provides a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Further studies are recommended to explore these pathways in the clinical setting."
39993805,Prostate Cancer: De-regulated Circular RNAs With Efficacy in Preclinical In Vivo Models.,"Therapy resistance, including castration-resistance and metastasis, remains a major hurdle in the treatment of prostate cancer. In order to identify novel therapeutic targets and treatment modalities for prostate cancer, we conducted a comprehensive literature search on PubMed to identify de-regulated circular RNAs that influence treatment efficacy in preclinical prostate cancer-related in vivo models. Our analysis identified 49 circular RNAs associated with various processes, including treatment resistance, transmembrane and secreted proteins, transcription factors, signaling cascades, human antigen R, nuclear receptor binding, ubiquitination, metabolism, epigenetics and other target categories. The identified targets and circular RNAs can be further scrutinized through target validation approaches. Down-regulated circular RNAs are candidates for reconstitution therapy, while up-regulated RNAs can be inhibited using small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR associated (CRISPR-CAS)-related approaches."
39993800,Integrated Pharmacogenetic Signature for the Prediction of Prostatic Neoplasms in Men With Metabolic Disorders.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Oncogenic processes are delineated by metabolic dysregulation. Drug likeness is pharmacokinetically tested through the CYP450 enzymatic system, whose genetic aberrations under epigenetic stress could shift male organisms into prostate cancer pathways. Our objective was to predict the susceptibility to prostate neoplasia, focused on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa), based on the pharmacoepigenetic and the metabolic profile of Caucasians. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent cohorts of 47,389 individuals in total were assessed to find risk associations of CYP450 genes with prostatic neoplasia. The metabolic profile of the first cohort was statistically evaluated and frequencies of absorption-distribution-metabolism-excretion-toxicity (ADMET) properties were calculated. Prediction of miRNA pharmacoepigenetic targeting was performed. RESULTS: We found that prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients of the first cohort shared common cardiometabolic trends. Drug classes C08CA, C09AA, C09CA, C10AA, C10AX of the cardiovascular, and G04CA, G04CB of the genitourinary systems, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk, while C03CA and N06AB of the cardiovascular and nervous systems were associated with low-risk for PCa. CYP3A4*1B was the most related pharmacogenetic polymorphism associated with prostate cancer susceptibility. miRNA-200c-3p and miRNA-27b-3p seem to be associated with CYP3A4 targeting and prostate cancer predisposition. Metabolomic analysis indicated that 11beta-OHT, 2beta-OHT, 15beta-OHT, 2alpha-OHT and 6beta-OHT had a high risk, and 16alpha-OHT, and 16beta-OHT had an intermediate disease-risk. CONCLUSION: These findings constitute a novel integrated signature for prostate cancer susceptibility. Further studies are required to assess their predictive value more fully."
39992723,A multi-perspective study assessing Black and African American participation barriers in prostate cancer clinical trials.,"AIMS: This study aimed to partner with patients, advocates, and physicians to better understand the barriers that exist for Black and African Americans to enroll in prostate cancer (PCa) clinical trials. PATIENTS & METHODS: Through moderated discussions with patients, advocates, and physicians, we identified potential opportunities to increase the enrollment of underrepresented patients in PCa clinical trials. RESULTS: We identified key barriers to Black and African American enrollment in PCa clinical trials that were shared by all groups but also identified group-specific barriers. We developed recommendations based on key themes that have the potential to increase the enrollment of Black and African Americans in PCa clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: While racial diversity in PCa clinical trials remains an unsolved problem, there are significant opportunities to better address this unmet need. Through a multi-perspective approach to identify key barriers that limit Black and African American enrollment in PCa clinical trials, we developed recommendations for both sponsors and clinical trial sites to increase diverse patient enrollment in PCa clinical trials, with a focus on employing practical strategies."
39992716,Longitudinal Profiling of Circulating Tumor DNA Reveals the Evolutionary Dynamics of Metastatic Prostate Cancer During Serial Therapy.,"Treatment decisions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are mostly guided by clinical variables, but efforts to molecularly monitor the disease remain hampered by challenges in acquiring tumor tissue repeatedly. Here, we simultaneously profiled the genome copy number and exome in longitudinal plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) acquired before, during, and upon progression to serial treatments with androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) and taxane chemotherapy from 60 mCRPC patients (2-10 samples per patient). The genomic data was used to delineate the clonal substructure and evolutionary dynamics of each patient, and an evolutionary dynamic index (EDI) was developed to measure the longitudinal changes of the tumor subclones. Treatment with ASI resulted in greater subclonal selection and population structure changes than taxane treatment. The subclones that emerged in association with serial therapy resistance harbored recurrent aberrations in previously identified and new candidate genes, with particular enrichment in genes related to PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings indicate that the integration of detailed clinical and genomics data can provide a framework for future unbiased genomic applications for ctDNA in the clinic to enable precision medicine."
39992612,Considerations for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome molecular diagnosis: experience from the clinical practice.,"PURPOSE: The implementation of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) in clinical practice has improved the genetic diagnosis of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC). We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic outcomes of using an NGS cancer gene panel in clinical practice for patients selected based on personal and/or family history of breast, ovarian, prostate, melanoma, and other HBOC-associated cancers. METHODS: The study series included 2561 consecutive Spanish individuals referred for genetic testing, comprising 2445 cancer patients and 116 healthy individuals with family history of HBOC. Eleven HBOC susceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, TP53, and PTEN) and three Lynch Syndrome genes (MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6) available for opportunistic testing were analyzed using a commercial Hereditary Cancer Panel and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. RESULTS: Overall, the diagnostic yield was 11.0% in cancer patients and 8.6% in healthy individuals with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer. Pathogenic variants in high-risk genes were more frequent in patients with multiple HBOC tumors and a family history of different HBOC cancers. Additionally, we diagnosed five families with Lynch syndrome through opportunistic testing. CONCLUSION: Testing cancer susceptibility genes using an agnostic strategy confers a diagnostic benefit for hereditary cancer syndromes compared to phenotype-driven test, without adding complexity to the study. The analysis of healthy individuals with a family history of HBOC detects pathogenic variants in a cost-efficient percentage of cases, resulting in a good alternative strategy when the index case is unavailable."
39990458,Covalent Destabilizing Degrader of AR and AR-V7 in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Androgen-independent prostate cancers, correlated with heightened aggressiveness and poor prognosis, are caused by mutations or deletions in the androgen receptor (AR) or expression of truncated variants of AR that are constitutively activated. Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets."
39990314,The Landscape of Prostate Tumour Methylation.,"Prostate cancer is characterized by profound heterogeneity in its clinical trajectory. While genomic heterogeneity has been well-characterized, epigenomic heterogeneity remains less understood. To fill this gap, we compiled 2,149 multi-ancestric prostate methylomes spanning normal tissue through localized disease of varying grades to poly-metastatic disease, most with multi-omic DNA and/or RNA characterization. We identify four subtypes that varied by stage, grade and mutational subtype. We identify extensive interplay between DNA ploidy and DNA methylation, with transcriptional consequences that vary across driver-genes. Each major prostate cancer driver gene mutation triggers a specific epigenetic dysregulation, and we define a set of 14 reusable models that accurately predict clinico-molecular features of a prostate cancer from DNA methylation data. Specific epigenetic features predict disease aggression, including metastasis, with epigenomic and genomic features synergizing to optimize predictions. These results define a complex interplay between tumour genetics and epigenetics that converges to modify gene-expression programs, and subsequent clinical presentation."
39988985,NAD(+) Metabolism Reprogramming Drives SIRT1-Dependent Deacetylation Inducing PD-L1 Nuclear Localization in Cervical Cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a major health threat to women, with immunotherapies targeting the programmed death receptor 1/programmed death ligand 1(PD-1/PD-L1) axis showing promise but encountering resistance in a significant patient population. This resistance has driven a critical quest to uncover the underlying mechanisms. This study uncovers a novel metabolic axis involving the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) salvage pathway enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and the deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which regulates PD-L1 expression and nuclear localization in CC. This axis may be a key factor contributing to the resistance observed in immunotherapy. This study reveals that PD-L1 overexpression in cancers is regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Acetyl-proteomic analysis pinpoints SIRT1 as a central regulator in the deacetylation of histone H3 at lysines 27, which may influence PD-L1 subcellular distribution. This finding reveals the epigenetic control of immune checkpoint proteins by metabolic pathways, offering a new perspective on the regulation of PD-L1. The identification of the NAMPT/SIRT1 metabolic axis as a critical factor suggests that targeting this axis may enhance therapeutic responses."
39987223,Decoding Codon Usage Patterns in High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Genomes: A Comprehensive Analysis.,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a major contributor to various human cancers, particularly cervical cancer. Despite its significant impact, the codon usage bias in high-risk HPV types has not been extensively studied. Understanding this bias, however, could provide valuable insights into the virus itself and inform the optimization of vaccine design. This study explores codon usage bias within the genomes of 17 high-risk HPV types (HPV-16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, and 82) through comparative analysis. While overall codon usage preference across these genotypes is not highly significant, a notable trend emerges in the preference for codons ending in A or U, with 24 out of 26 favored codons (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage > 1) ending in A or U. Moreover, no common optimal codons are shared among the 17 genomes. The study also identifies the underrepresentation of CpG and ApA dinucleotides, alongside the overrepresentation of CpA and UpG, which likely contribute to codon usage preferences that may influence viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Integrated analysis further suggests that natural selection is the primary force driving codon usage bias in these high-risk HPV genomes. Additionally, these HPVs exhibit a limited set of favored codons shared with humans, potentially minimizing competition for translation resources. This study offers new insights into codon usage bias in high-risk HPVs and underscores the importance of this understanding for optimizing vaccine design."
39985618,CD13 as a potential theranostic target for prostate-specific membrane antigen-negative prostate cancer and first-in-human study of [(18)F]AlF-CD13-L1 PET/CT imaging.,"PURPOSE: Approximately 10% of prostate cancer (PCa) are prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-negative, leading to blind spots in PSMA-based diagnosis. This study aimed to identify a potential target for PSMA-negative PCa and preliminarily evaluate the feasibility of using radionuclide probe targeting the identified target for PCa diagnosis. METHODS: Quantitative protein analysis was performed on eight PSMA-negative PCa and eleven controls to identify a potential molecular target, followed by validation with an expanded cohort using immunohistochemistry. Sixteen participants underwent [(18)F]AlF-CD13-L1 PET/CT scanning, with the PCa pathological tissues used as references to interpret the imaging results. RESULTS: Quantitative protein analysis revealed CD13 as the most significantly upregulated membrane protein in PSMA-negative PCa. Expanded validation results indicated that CD13 positivity rates were 92.9% (13/14), 82.7% (105/127), 91.7% (11/12), and 70% (14/20) in PSMA-negative PCa, PSMA-positive PCa, ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DAC), and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), respectively. In PCa participants, the median [(18)F]AlF-CD13-L1 PET/CT maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of tumors and tumor-to-muscle ratio were 4.3 (1.5-5.8) and 4.6 (1.7-6.1), respectively. The SUVmax value of the PCa lesions and the tumor-to-muscle ratio showed a positive correlation with the immunohistochemical score of CD13 of the PCa lesions (r(spearman) = 0.6249, p = 0.025; r(spearman) = 0.6714, p = 0.015, respectively), with CD13-positive tumors showing significant radiotracer accumulation. CONCLUSION: CD13 was a potential target for PSMA-negative PCa and also showed high positivity rates in PSMA-positive PCa, DAC, and IDC-P. [(18)F]AlF-CD13-L1 selectively accumulated in CD13-positive PCa, enabling visualization. (Trial registration: ChiCTR2300077817. Registered November 21, 2023)."
39985357,Application of Next-Generation Sequencing to Realize Principles of Precision Therapy in Management of Cancer Patients.,"All cancers are diseases of the genome, since the cancer cell genome typically consists of 10,000s of passenger alterations, 5-10 biologically relevant alterations, and 1-2 ""actionable"" alterations. Therefore, somatic mutations in cancer cells can have diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value. Traditional methods are widely used for testing, such as immunohistochemistry, Sanger sequencing, and allele-specific PCR. However, due to the low throughput, these methods are focused exclusively on testing the most common mutations in target genes. The modern next generation sequencing (NGS) is a technology that enables precision oncology in its current form. ESCAT and ESMO Guidelines defined NGS for routine use in patients with advanced cancers such as non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. The high sensitivity of the NGS method allows it to be used to search for specific mutations in circulating tumor DNA in blood plasma and other body fluids. NGS testing has evolved from hotspot panels, actionable gene panels, and disease-specific panels to more comprehensive panels. The exome and whole genome sequencing approaches are just beginning to emerge, that is why panel-based testing remains most optimal in oncology practice. NGS is also widely used to identify new and rare mutations in cancer genes and detect inherited cancer mutations."
39985003,De novo familial adenomatous polyposis with germline double heterozygosity of APC/BRCA2: a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: The widespread application of colonoscopy screening and genetic testing in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment has led to the identification of a subset of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients who lack a family history of the disease but harbor germline gene mutations. Moreover, distinct genotypes may be associated with varied clinical presentations and therapeutic options. This case report describes a male patient with de novo FAP who harbored germline double heterozygosity (GDH) for APC and BRCA2 mutations. The patient underwent total colectomy, and genetic testing enabled personalized surveillance and management strategies for his family members. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old male with no family history of cancer presented to the outpatient clinic of the Colorectal Surgery Department with complaints of constipation and hematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed hundreds of polyps throughout the colon and a rectal adenocarcinoma located 5 cm from the anal verge. Gastroduodenal endoscopy did not detect any upper gastrointestinal adenomas. The patient underwent laparoscopic total colectomy with abdominoperineal resection of the rectum and end ileostomy. With the consent of the patient and his family, genetic testing was performed. The index patient was found to carry an APC splicing site mutation (exon 15: c.1744-1G > A) and a BRCA2 missense mutation (exon 17: c.7976G > A: p.R2659K). His daughter was found to have inherited the same germline BRCA2 variant. Additionally, the rectal cancer exhibited proficient DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) status, ERBB2 copy number amplification, and a missense mutation, while the KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes were wild-type. Based on the genetic testing results and clinical manifestations, the index patient was diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and rectal cancer. Personalized surveillance and management strategies were implemented for the patient and his family, focusing on the risks of extra-colonic diseases and potential malignancies in the prostate, pancreas, breast, and ovaries. CONCLUSION: De novo FAP with double germline mutations in APC and BRCA2, along with somatic ERBB2 mutations, is exceptionally rare among hereditary cancer cases. With the rapid advancements in genomics, the detection of multiple gene variants in individuals or families has become increasingly common. Additionally, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical research may provide powerful tools for genetic analysis and clinical decision-making. Consequently, a comprehensive evaluation of family history, a deep understanding of hereditary cancer syndromes, and precise interpretation of genetic mutations are essential for personalized clinical management in the era of precision medicine. However, these tasks pose significant challenges for clinicians and genetic counselors alike."
39982975,Altered immune landscape of cervical lymph nodes reveals Epstein-Barr virus signature in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a prerequisite for developing the disease. However, the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to MS remain to be determined. Here, we characterized the immune landscape of deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) in newly diagnosed untreated patients with MS (pwMS) using fine-needle aspirations. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, we observed increased memory B cells and reduced germinal center B cells with decreased clonality in pwMS. Double-negative memory B cells were increased in pwMS that transcriptionally resembled B cells with a lytic EBV infection. Moreover, EBV-targeting memory CD8 T cells were detected in a subset of pwMS. We also detected increased EBV DNA in dcLNs and elevated viral loads in patient saliva. These findings suggest that EBV-driven B cell dysregulation is a critical mechanism in MS pathogenesis."
39981201,Novel diagnostics for improved treatment of gynecological cancer.,"This paper summarizes the efforts to develop novel biomarkers for diagnosis and screening of the three main gynecological cancers, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer, with an emphasis on research performed during the last 20 years in Uppsala. A cervical cancer screening program has existed in Sweden since 1966 using cytology as the primary test. Over the last two decades, research has provided the scientific base for a transition to self-sampling to improve convenience of the woman and achieve higher population coverage, and use of human papillomavirus as the primary test. Also, efficient prophylactic vaccines and more efficient treatment strategies of women with cervical dysplasia have been introduced. Together, these medical tools have the potential to eradicate cervical cancer by 2120, as envisaged by WHO. By contrast, efficient biomarkers for endometrial and ovarian cancer are still lacking. Through the use of high-throughput proteomics, we have identified novel plasma protein biomarkers to be used in the diagnosis of women with adnexal ovarian mass upon transvaginal ultrasound, and possibly also for early detection in population screening. Similarly, novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer are being evaluated. To establish a population-based screening program requires careful cost-benefit analyses. One alternative would be to broaden the focus of the current cervical cancer screening program to include also the novel biomarkers for ovarian and endometrial cancer, and thereby achieve screening for all three gynecological cancers. A program that screens for all three diseases could increase motivation to participate and thereby population coverage."
39980679,A step forward in enhancing the health-promoting properties of whole tomato as a functional food to lower the impact of non-communicable diseases.,"Nutritional interventions facilitating the consumption of natural, affordable, and environment-compatible health-promoting functional foods are a promising strategy for controlling non-communicable diseases. Given that the complex of tomato micronutrients produces healthier outcomes than lycopene, its major antioxidant component, new strategies to improve the health-supporting properties of the berry are ongoing. In this context, a whole tomato food supplement (WTFS), enriched by 2% olive wastewater containing a complex of healthy nutrients with converging biologic activities, has recently been developed, which is superior to those present in tomato commodities or obtained with whole tomato conventional processing methods. WTFS equals the antioxidant activity of N-acetyl-cysteine and interferes with multiple inflammation and cellular transformation-sustaining metabolic pathways. In interventional studies, WTFS inhibits prostate experimental tumors and improves benign prostate hypertrophy-associated symptoms with no associated side-effects. Although WTFS may be susceptible to further improvements and clinical scrutiny, its composition embodies the features of advanced functional foods to ease adherence to dietary patterns, that is, the Mediterranean diet, aimed at contrasting and mitigating the low-grade inflammation, thus being interceptive or preventive of non-communicable diseases."
39978863,Spatial profiling of ANO7 in prostate tissue: links to AR-signalling-associated lipid metabolism and inflammation.,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) is highly prevalent in the Western world. Currently, however, there are many unmet needs in PrCa care, for example in distinguishing between clinically significant and indolent cases in early phases of the disease. ANO7 is a prostate-specific gene associated with PrCa risk and prognosis, but its exact function in the prostate remains unclear. This study investigates the role of ANO7 in benign prostatic epithelium using spatial transcriptomics by examining differences between ANO7-expressing and non-expressing epithelial regions and their corresponding stromal compartments. A total of 18,676 protein-coding genes were assessed from prostatectomy samples collected from patients with localised prostate cancer. In the collected sample cohort, ANO7 exhibited a distinct, heterogeneous, on-off epithelial expression pattern, enabling an in-depth analysis of ANO7-dependent processes. ANO7-positive epithelium was predominantly enriched with luminal epithelial cells and a specific NK cell subtype, CD56bright. In contrast, ANO7-negative regions were characterised by enrichment of club cells, inflammation, and features of proliferative inflammatory atrophy. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that ANO7 expression is associated with androgen receptor (AR) signalling and lipid metabolism. A detailed analysis of differentially expressed genes identified an ANO7- signature, which consisted of genes co-expressed with ANO7 in luminal cells, that demonstrated high consistency in bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The ANO7-signature was enriched for AR-regulated genes, which highlighted lipid metabolism processes, particularly arachidonic acid metabolism, as a key metabolic feature of the ANO7-positive epithelium. Furthermore, the ANO7-signature demonstrated clinical significance in low-grade PrCa, correlating with a better response to therapy. In summary, these results highlight the potential role of ANO7 in regulating lipid metabolism associated with androgen signalling in benign luminal cells and low-grade cancer, reinforcing the hypothesis that ANO7 functions as a tumour suppressor.

39978808,Clinical Trial Protocol for LuCAB: A Phase I-II Trial Evaluating Cabazitaxel in Combination with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"[(177)Lu]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with docetaxel and an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. However, for many, responses are short and progression is inevitable. Contributing factors to treatment resistance include molecular heterogeneity with variable PSMA expression, micrometastases that may not absorb sufficient radiation from (177)Lu to result in cell death, and inherent or acquired radioresistance because of genomic alterations or the tumor microenvironment. Cabazitaxel is a radiosensitizer and may treat PSMA-negative disease that would otherwise evade targeting by [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. We hypothesize that the combination of [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and cabazitaxel will be synergistic with an acceptable safety profile. Methods: This investigator-initiated phase I-II trial aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of cabazitaxel and [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in combination. Up to 38 patients with mCRPC will receive up to 6 doses of [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 administered intravenously every 6 wk at a fixed dose of 7.4 GBq. Cabazitaxel will be administered concurrently (dose range, 12.5-20 mg/m(2)) on day 2 and day 23 of each 6-wk cycle, with dose escalation determined using a traditional 3 + 3 design to establish the maximum tolerated or administered dose. Key eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of progressive mCRPC with PSMA-positive disease on PSMA PET/CT (SUV(max) >/= 15) and no sites of discordance on [(18)F]F-FDG PET/CT. Patients must have received prior docetaxel and an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor, have adequate bone marrow and organ function, and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. The primary objective is to assess for dose-limiting toxicities and determine the recommended phase II dose of cabazitaxel and [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in combination. Secondary objectives include further safety evaluation through the measurement of the frequency and severity of adverse events, assessment of efficacy, and evaluation of changes in pain and health-related quality of life over the first 12 mo from treatment commencement. Plasma will be collected at baseline, during treatment, and at disease progression for circulating tumor DNA analysis, which will be correlated with clinical outcomes to identify potential biomarkers of treatment response or resistance. Conclusion: Enrollment commenced in August 2022, with anticipated completion in 2025."
39976849,Therapeutic implications of endoplasmic reticulum stress gene CCL3 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"This study investigated ERS-related gene expressions in CESC, identifying two molecular subtypes, P1 and P2, and constructing a precise prognostic model based on these subtypes. TCGA's whole-genome expression profiles were used to recognize these subtypes through the ConsensusClusterPlus method, further refining prognostic models with univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses validated by the GSE39001 dataset. The study analyzed the expression distribution of ERS marker genes within T cell subgroups using scRNA-seq data (GSE168652), highlighting T cell diversity. The critical role of the CCL3 gene in prognostic models was examined explicitly in CD8 + T cells from healthy individuals and CESC patients. Elevated CCL3 levels were observed in patients' CD8 + T cells compared to healthy controls. Functional experiments involving CCL3 knockdown and overexpression in HeLa and SiHa CESC cell lines were conducted to investigate its impact on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings were subsequently validated in a nude mouse model. The results demonstrated that suppressing CCL3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion significantly, while its overexpression promoted these processes. In the mouse model, CCL3 silencing reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 labeling within the tumor tissues, indicating the therapeutic potential of targeting CCL3 in CESC treatment, possibly through CD8 + T cell regulation. This study contributes new prognostic assessment tools and personalized treatment options for CESC patients, paving the way for more targeted therapies in CESC by discovering the CCL3 gene, presenting significant clinical implications."
39975411,"Fast, flexible analysis of differences in cellular composition with crumblr.","Changes in cell type composition play an important role in human health and disease. Recent advances in single-cell technology have enabled the measurement of cell type composition at increasing cell lineage resolution across large cohorts of individuals. Yet this raises new challenges for statistical analysis of these compositional data to identify changes in cell type frequency. We introduce crumblr (DiseaseNeurogenomics.github.io/crumblr), a scalable statistical method for analyzing count ratio data using precision-weighted linear mixed models incorporating random effects for complex study designs. Uniquely, crumblr performs statistical testing at multiple levels of the cell lineage hierarchy using a multivariate approach to increase power over tests of one cell type. In simulations, crumblr increases power compared to existing methods while controlling the false positive rate. We demonstrate the application of crumblr to published single-cell RNA-seq datasets for aging, tuberculosis infection in T cells, bone metastases from prostate cancer, and SARS-CoV-2 infection."
39974424,Cuproptosis-related genes signature could predict prognosis and the response of immunotherapy in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A lot of studies have shown a close relationship between cuproptosis and cancer. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of cuproptosis on cervical cancer (CC). METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public database, we analyzed the genetic correlation, expression, and prognostic value of 25 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in CC. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) risk regression model was constructed to compare the changes in associated pathways, prognosis, immune infiltration, and antibody programmed cell death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) treatment response of the high- and low-risk groups. In addition, we collected CC tissue samples before and after radiotherapy for ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, and analyzed the relationship between CRGs and radiotherapy. RESULTS: The results showed CRGs were differentially expressed and were associated with multiple metabolic pathways. High expression of COX7B, PIH1D2, NDUFA1, NDUFA2 and NDUFB1 indicated a better prognosis. CRGs signature could predict prognosis (P<0.001) and affect immune infiltration. The prognosis was better in the low-risk group, while the high-risk group was more correlated with PD-L1. SLC25A5 downregulated expression (P=0.001) and SLC6A3 upregulated (P=0.02) after radiotherapy. SLC25A5 was related to the degree of differentiation of CC; the worse the differentiation, the higher the expression. CONCLUSIONS: CRGs may further affect patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy by influencing metabolic pathways and immune infiltration. Radiation could alter the expression of CRGs, which may have potential research value in evaluating the efficacy of radiotherapy."
39974420,Exploration of key pathogenic mechanisms and potential intervention targets of the traditional Chinese medicine Coptis chinensis in the treatment of cervical cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown potential in the treatment of cancer. This study investigated the molecular targets and mechanisms of Coptis chinensis in the treatment of cervical cancer using network pharmacology and bioinformatics. METHODS: Effective Coptis chinensis components were screened from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) platform based on the following criteria: drug-like properties (DLP) >/=0.18 and oral bioavailability (OB) >/=30%. Target genes were identified through DrugBank, while differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cervical cancer were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE7803) based on the following criteria: |log fold change| >2 and P<0.05. Common DEGs were identified through a Venn diagram analysis. The expression and prognostic relevance of the candidate genes were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Molecular docking was performed using Pubchem, Protein Data Bank (PDB), and CB-DOCK2. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to explore the potential mechanisms of DEGs. A retrospective analysis of cervical cancer patients (June 2021 to June 2022) was performed to examine the expression of key genes in the peripheral blood via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A multivariate Cox regression was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 10 effective Coptis chinensis compounds and 181 target genes were identified from the TCMSP database. The GEO analysis of GSE7803 identified 109 DEGs. The Venn diagram analysis identified the following seven shared DEGs: AR, MAOB, CDKN2A, TOP2A, CXCL8, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and SPP1. MMP1 and SPP1 were confirmed to be upregulated candidate genes in cervical cancer tissues, and to be associated with a worse prognosis [overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI), P<0.05]. Molecular docking showed that MMP1 had high binding affinity with quercetin (-9.2) while that of SPP1 was lower (-6.3). The GSEA indicated that MMP1 was involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathways, and apoptosis. The retrospective analysis demonstrated that MMP1 expression was significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy and Coptis chinensis compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed that high MMP1 expression and a lack of Coptis chinensis treatment were independent risk factors for a poor prognosis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MMP1 could be a predictive biomarker for cervical cancer. Coptis chinensis may exert therapeutic effects through MMP1 regulation via multiple pathways. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of MMP1."
39973042,Integration of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data reveals the prognostic potential of epithelial gene markers for prostate cancer.,"Prognostic transcriptomic signatures for prostate cancer (PCa) often overlook the cellular origin of expression changes, an important consideration given the heterogeneity of the disorder. Current clinicopathological factors inadequately predict biochemical recurrence, a critical indicator guiding post-treatment strategies following radical prostatectomy. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis of four large-scale PCa datasets and found 33 previously reported PCa-associated genes to be consistently up-regulated in prostate tumours. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we found these genes predominantly as markers in epithelial cells. Subsequently, we applied 97 advanced machine-learning algorithms across five PCa cohorts and developed an 11-gene epithelial expression signature. This signature robustly predicted biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) and stratified patients into distinct risk categories, with high-risk patients showing worse survival and altered immune cell populations. The signature outperformed traditional clinical parameters in larger cohorts and was overall superior to published PCa signatures for BCRFS. By analysing peripheral blood data, four of our signature genes showed potential as biomarkers for radiation response in patients with localised cancer and effectively stratified castration-resistant patients for overall survival. In conclusion, this study developed a novel epithelial gene-expression signature that enhanced BCRFS prediction and enabled effective risk stratification compared to existing clinical- and gene-expression-derived prognostic tools. Furthermore, a set of genes from the signature demonstrated potential utility in peripheral blood, a tissue amenable to minimally invasive sampling in a primary care setting, offering significant prognostic value for PCa patients without requiring a tumour biopsy."
39971927,"Assessing the contribution of rare protein-coding germline variants to prostate cancer risk and severity in 37,184 cases.","To assess the contribution of rare coding germline genetic variants to prostate cancer risk and severity, we perform here a meta-analysis of 37,184 prostate cancer cases and 331,329 male controls from five cohorts with germline whole exome or genome sequencing data, and one cohort with imputed array data. At the gene level, our case-control collapsing analysis confirms associations between rare damaging variants in four genes and increased prostate cancer risk: SAMHD1, BRCA2 and ATM at the study-wide significance level (P < 1x10(-8)), and CHEK2 at the suggestive threshold (P < 2.6x10(-6)). Our case-only analysis, reveals that rare damaging variants in AOX1 are associated with more aggressive disease (OR = 2.60 [1.75-3.83], P = 1.35x10(-6)), as well as confirming the role of BRCA2 in determining disease severity. At the single-variant level, our study reveals that a rare missense variant in TERT is associated with substantially reduced prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.13 [0.07-0.25], P = 4.67x10(-10)), and confirms rare non-synonymous variants in a further three genes associated with reduced risk (ANO7, SPDL1, AR) and in three with increased risk (HOXB13, CHEK2, BIK). Altogether, this work provides deeper insights into the genetic architecture and biological basis of prostate cancer risk and severity, with potential implications for clinical risk prediction and therapeutic strategies."
39971909,Lon protease 1-mediated metabolic reprogramming promotes the progression of prostate cancer.,"Lon protease 1 (LONP1) is an ATP-dependent protease located in the mitochondrial matrix and plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial proteostasis, metabolism, and cellular stress responses et al. Aberrant LONP1 expression has been found in the progression of various tumors; however, the role and molecular mechanisms of LONP1 in prostate cancer (PCa) remain poorly understood. Here we show that overexpression of LONP1 is closely related to adverse clinic pathological features and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Mechanistically, the findings reveal that LONP1 is implicated in modulating the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, thereby promoting tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, we prove that LONP1 as a protease directly targets mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1), a key metabolic protein in the process of glycolysis, and enhances its degradation, which in turn suppresses tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ultimately promotes the progression of PCa. Furthermore, using PCa in cancer-prone mice homozygous for a prostate-targeted conditional Pten knockout and Lonp1 knockin, we integrate transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of prostate tumors, upon which reveals that Lonp1 overexpression results in a significant downregulation of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, consequently impeding the electron transfer process and mitochondrial ATP synthesis, associated with metastasis of PCa. Collectively, our results highlight that metabolic reprogramming induced by LONP1 in PCa is closely coupled with disease progression, suggesting that targeting the LONP1-mediated cascade in the mitochondrial may provide therapeutic potential for PCa disease."
39968714,Comprehensive Analysis of Clinical and Molecular Features in Cancer Patients Associated With Major Human Oncoviruses.,"Viral infections contribute to a higher incidence of cancer than any other individual risk factor. This study aimed to compare the clinical and molecular features of four viral-associated cancers: stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC). Patients were categorized based on viral infection status, as provided in the clinical data, into virus-associated and non-virus-associated groups, followed by a comprehensive comparison of clinical and molecular features. Our analysis disclosed that viral infections confer unique clinical and molecular signatures to their associated tumors. Specifically, human papillomavirus-associated (HPV+) HNSC and hepatitis B virus-associated (HBV+) LIHC patients were predominantly male, younger, and exhibited better clinical prognoses. Virus-associated tumors displayed enhanced immune microenvironments and high DNA damage response scores, while non-virus-associated tumors were enriched in stromal signatures. HPV+ HNSC and Epstein-Barr virus-associated (EBV+) STAD showed similarities across multi-omics features, including better responses to immunotherapy, lower TP53 mutation rates, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and copy number alteration (CNA). Conversely, HBV+, Hepatitis C virus-associated (HCV+) LIHCs and HPV+ CESC were more genomically unstable due to high TP53 mutation rates, TMB, and CNA. At the protein level, Caspase-7 and Syk were upregulated in HPV+ HNSC and EBV+ STAD, and positively correlated with the enrichment levels of CD8 + T cell, PD-L1, and cytolytic activity. Patient stratification based on infection status has significant clinical implications, particularly for patient prognosis and drug response."
39968635,A comprehensive systematic review of studies on the potential of A49T and V89L polymorphism in SRD5AR2 as high susceptibility gene association with benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Being the most common disease in aged men, the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not fully defined. Recent studies have reported that the association between BPH and metabolic genes is still inconsistent. A gene connected with BPH is SRD5AR2, whose polymorphisms, A49T and V89L, have distinct enzyme activity. This systematic review examines SRD5AR2 polymorphisms within two alleles (A49T and V89L), assessing their roles as prognostic indicators of malignancy, and response to medication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a search on six different databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Wiley, ProQuest, Cochrane Central, and Science Direct using as string of keywords (BPH) AND [(rs523349) OR (V89L)] AND [(rs9282858) OR (A49T)]. We finally selected seven articles to be extracted. Quality appraisal of clinical trials was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Approach for systematic reviews. RESULTS: We sorted nine clinical studies from various countries examining SRDA52 polymorphism and its association of BPH and prostate cancer. About V89L we found that the ""LL"" genotype, indicating reduced 5alpha-reductase activity, is linked to a lower BPH risk, while the ""VV"" genotype may slightly increase BPH risk. About A49T, compared to ""AA"" genotype, ""AT"" tends to be associated to higher risk in developing prostate cancer. A49T polymorphism does not show any effect on medical treatment while V89L showed a protective effect on the clinical progression of BPH when treated with 5a-reductase inhibitors, aadrenergic receptor antagonists, and alpha blockers. CONCLUSIONS: SRD5A2 polymorphisms could be a good indicator for prognostic malignancy and a potential tool for personalized medicine of BPH. The findings strongly support the recommendation for further study about SRD5AR2 to enhance its use for screening and prevention and to optimize the medical treatment of BPH."
39967042,Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Lipopolysaccharide-Challenged Gingival Fibroblast Reveal Distinct miRNA Expression Patterns Associated With Reduced Cancer Survival.,"OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease with established systemic implications. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication, potentially linking periodontitis to systemic diseases. However, the molecular cargo of EVs from inflamed periodontal cells remains poorly characterized. This study investigates the EV cargo of human gingival fibroblasts (hGF-hTERT) following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and explores their potential role in cancer progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EVs were isolated from LPS-treated and untreated fibroblasts via ultracentrifugation. Dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy characterized EV size and morphology. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed miRNAs, validated by qPCR. Functional pathway enrichment and in-silico analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were performed to assess EV-associated miRNA impact on tumorigenesis. RESULTS: EV size and concentration remained unchanged after LPS stimulation. However, LPS-derived EVs exhibited a 2.6-fold increase in miRNA content, with three significantly upregulated miRNAs: miR-146a-5p, miR-486-5p, and miR-451a. Functional enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in inflammation, immune modulation, and cancer pathways. In vitro, LPS-derived EVs significantly enhanced prostate cancer (LnCap) cell proliferation. TCGA analysis linked the upregulated miRNAs to poor cancer prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: LPS stimulation alters the miRNA cargo of gingival fibroblast-derived EVs, enhancing pathways associated with inflammation and cancer progression. These findings suggest a mechanistic role for periodontal EVs in systemic disease pathogenesis, warranting further investigation into their diagnostic and therapeutic potential."
39965835,[The expression of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and its relationship with prognosis based on bioinformatics].,"Objective: To investigate the role of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and its potential molecular mechanism. Methods: Gene expression data of cervical tissue were obtained from the GEO database to analyze the expression of YTHDF2 mRNA and perform pathway enrichment analysis. Patients with cervical lesions diagnosed by thinprep cytologic test in Gynecological Outpatient Department of Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Jiexiu, Shanxi Province, were selected as the research subjects. Data of cervical lesions and cervical exfoliated cells were collected. HPV infection status was detected by flow-through hybridization, and the expression of YTHDF2 mRNA was detected by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of YTHDF2 in cervical lesions and the mediating role of HPV infection in the relationship between YTHDF2 and squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) were evaluated. YTHDF2-related genes were screened from multiple datasets in the GEO and ENCORI databases, and their expression, immune infiltration, and survival analysis were performed to assess the association between YTHDF2 and prognosis. Results: Compared with normal cervical tissue, YTHDF2 was highly expressed in cervical lesion tissue (P<0.05). A total of 3 672 differentially expressed genes were screened from the dataset GSE49339. Gene Ontology analysis showed that YTHDF2 was mainly involved in transcription regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that YTHDF2 might be related to HPV infection and other signaling pathways. In the mediation analysis, chi(2) test results showed that the expression level of YTHDF2 was significantly different among groups (chi(2)=22.47, P<0.001). Trend chi(2) test further showed that the expression level of YTHDF2 was upregulated with the degree of cervical precancerous lesions (trend chi(2)=10.26, P=0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that high YTHDF2 expression increased the risk of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (OR=3.15, 95%CI: 1.93-5.15) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (OR=1.85, 95%CI: 1.01-3.39). Mediation effect analysis revealed a partial mediating effect of HPV infection between YTHDF2 and SIL, accounting for 32.02% of the total effect. Twelve YTHDF2 related genes were screened by the intersection of multiple datasets. The immune infiltration analysis results showed that YTHDF2 and related genes KLF4, E2F3 and HOXC6 were associated with immune infiltration (all P<0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis showed that low expression of KLF4 (HR=0.53, 95%CI: 0.30-0.94) and high expression of RHOB (HR=1.80, 95%CI: 1.04-3.13) were risk factors for the prognosis of cervical cancer. Conclusion: YTHDF2 is highly expressed in cervical lesions and may have been involved in the regulation of HPV infection-related pathways and its downstream related genes are related to immune infiltration and prognosis of cervical cancer, providing a theoretical basis for the study of mechanisms related to cervical lesions."
39965403,Primary sarcomas of the bladder and prostate: A genomic landscape study.,"Primary sarcomas of the bladder and prostate are exceedingly rare, often highly aggressive and account for less than 1 % of all malignant tumors of these organs. In this landscape study, we searched for genomic biomarkers that could aid in either treatment selection or further classification of these tumors. 18 (0.2 %) bladder sarcomas were identified from 11,193 bladder cancers and 11 (0.6 %) prostate sarcomas were identified from 19,057 prostate cancers that underwent hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to assess all classes of genomic alterations (GA). The bladder sarcomas included 12 leiomyosarcomas, 3 rhabdomyosarcomas and 3 high-grade undifferentiated sarcomas. The sarcomas of the prostate featured 9 primary prostatic stromal sarcomas, 1 leiomyosarcoma and 1 rhabdomyosarcoma. The most frequent gene alterations were in TP53, RB1 and ATRX. Bladder sarcomas were also found to have more than 2-fold more genetic alterations than compared to prostatic sarcomas."
39964718,PSKH1 kinase activity is differentially modulated via allosteric binding of Ca(2+) sensor proteins.,"Protein Serine Kinase H1 (PSKH1) was recently identified as a crucial factor in kidney development and is overexpressed in prostate, lung, and kidney cancers. However, little is known about PSKH1 regulatory mechanisms, leading to its classification as a ""dark"" kinase. Here, we used biochemistry and mass spectrometry to define PSKH1's consensus substrate motif, protein interactors, and how interactors, including Ca(2+) sensor proteins, promote or suppress activity. Intriguingly, despite the absence of a canonical Calmodulin binding motif, Ca(2+)-Calmodulin activated PSKH1 while, in contrast, the ER-resident Ca(2+) sensor of the Cab45, Reticulocalbin, Erc55, Calumenin (CREC) family, Reticulocalbin-3, suppressed PSKH1 catalytic activity. In addition to antagonistic regulation of the PSKH1 kinase domain by Ca(2+) sensing proteins, we identified UNC119B as a protein interactor that activates PSKH1 via direct engagement of the kinase domain. Our findings identify complementary allosteric mechanisms by which regulatory proteins tune PSKH1's catalytic activity and raise the possibility that different Ca(2+) sensors may act more broadly to tune kinase activities by detecting and decoding extremes of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations."
39964205,Association of CDK8 Gene Polymorphisms with Cervical Cancer in Han Women in Southwest China.,"Background: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most prevalent gynecological tumor among women. Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), which plays a crucial role in cellular transcriptional processes and various signaling pathways, has been identified as a key oncogenic factor in numerous cancers. However, limited data exists on the correlation between CDK8 and CC. The objective of our study was to investigate whether there is an association between CDK8 gene polymorphisms and the development of CC in Han women from Southwest China. Materials and methods: A total of 300 unrelated CC patients and 335 healthy controls from Southwest China were included in the study. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was used to genotype the two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CDK8 gene (rs17083838 and rs7992670), and the relationship between the two tag SNPs and CC incidence was analyzed by SNPstats software. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to analyze the interaction of multiple polymorphisms of the CDK8 gene. The false-positive report probability (FPRP) was used to verify the effective correlation. Results: The frequency of the A allele of CDK8 rs17083838 in the CC group was significantly higher than that in the control group (25% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001, odds ratio (OR): 0.42, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.31-0.58). The frequency of the A allele at rs7992670 was higher in the CC group than that in the control group (52% vs. 45%, p = 0.026, OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.97). MDR analysis showed that rs17083838 and rs7992670 as the overall model was the best model, the detection accuracy was 0.6157, and the cross-validation consistency was 10/10 (p < 0.0001). In addition, 22 valid FRPR values were verified by using the FPRP detection method. Conclusion: The two SNPs of the CDK8 gene may be associated with the increased risk of CC in the Han population in Southwest China."
39964064,Causal association between telomere length and female cancers: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"PURPOSE: To explore the causal associations between genetically predicted telomere length and gynecologic and breast cancers. METHODS: This Mendelian randomization study used data from genome-wide association studies on telomere length and breast (BC), cervical cancer, endometrial (EC), and ovarian (OC) cancers. The primary analysis was performed using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, with confirmation using the weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger methods. Heterogeneity was detected using Cochran's Q-test, horizontal pleiotropy using MR-Egger regression, outliers using MR-PRESSO, and discordant single-nucleotide polymorphisms using the leave-one-out method. RESULTS: The genetic prediction results indicated causal associations between the risk of telomere length and EC [IVW; OR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.05-1.59, P = .02], leukocyte telomere length and EC (IVW; OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.01-1.51, P = .04), telomere length and OC (IVW; OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.01-1.60, P = .04), telomere length and BC (IVW; OR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.01-1.23, P = .03), and leukocyte telomere length and BC (IVW; OR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.02-1.24, P = .02). Cochran's Q-test revealed heterogeneity for telomere length and BC (P < .001), leukocyte telomere length and BC (P < .001), and B-cell telomere length and BC (P = .012). The MR-Egger regression results suggest that the analyses of telomere length and BC (P = .014) and leukocyte telomere length and BC (P = .044) were influenced by horizontal pleiotropy. The MR-PRESSO analysis indicated the presence of outliers in the analyses of telomere length and BC and leukocyte telomere length and breast cancer. After removing the outliers, the statistical significance remained. CONCLUSION: This MR study suggests a causal association between telomere length and BC, EC, and OC, warranting additional study. Key message What is already known on this topic?  Previous research has indicated an association between telomere length and the risk of various cancers, including breast and gynecologic cancers. However, the causal relationship remained unclear, necessitating further exploration to establish whether telomere length could be a modifiable risk factor for these cancers. What this study adds?  This study provides robust evidence of a causal relationship between genetically predicted telomere length and an increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer, with specific odds ratios indicating a significant association. It highlights that both leukocyte and overall telomere length are important factors in cancer risk. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy?  The findings could inform future research into telomere length as a biomarker for cancer risk, promote investigations into telomere-targeting interventions, and influence guidelines on screening and preventive strategies for at-risk populations based on genetic predispositions."
39963174,Clinicopathological correlates of vitamin D receptor expression in prostate cancer: results of genomic analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men. Geography and environmental factors have been associated with varying incidence and mortalities in different groups. Vitamin D has antiproliferative effect on PCa cells, and its effect is mediated through vitamin D receptor (VDR). This study reported the correlation of VDR expression with some clinicopathological and biological features among a cohort of patients with PCa. METHODS: Genomic and clinicopathological data of 497 patients with PCa reposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas were retrieved using Linux command in running codes and scripts and extrapolated onto SPSS version 28 for statistical analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted to determine the proportions and associations of VDR expression with genomic variables and clinicopathological indices. The mechanism of VDR dysregulation was also interrogated. RESULTS: Our results showed that high VDR expression was positively correlated with a high Gleason score (P < 0.001), poorer prognostic International Society of Urological Pathology grade groups (P < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (P = 0.01), and poorer response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Age, race, and overall and disease-free survival did not show any correlation with VDR expression (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the major mechanism of dysregulation of VDR in PCa was by aberrant methylation of the VDR promoter region (P < 0.001), and not by copy number alterations (P = 0.42). CONCLUSION: VDR expression is associated with adverse clinicopathological indices, including late-stage disease profile, high-grade indices, and poorer response to ADT. VDR is also mainly deregulated by aberrant epigenetic mechanism. The study is limited by absence of some clinical information such as sunlight exposure."
39962886,Redefining prostate cancer care: innovations and future directions in active surveillance.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides a critical analysis of recent advancements in active surveillance (AS), emphasizing updates from major international guidelines and their implications for clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent revisions to international guidelines have broadened the eligibility criteria for AS to include selected patients with ISUP grade group 2 prostate cancer. This adjustment acknowledges that certain intermediate-risk cancers may be appropriate for AS, reflecting a heightened focus on achieving a balance between oncologic control and maintaining quality of life by minimizing the risk of overtreatment. SUMMARY: This review explores key innovations in AS for prostate cancer, including multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), genomic biomarkers, and risk calculators, which enhance patient selection and monitoring. While promising, their routine use remains debated due to guideline inconsistencies, cost, and accessibility. Special focus is given to biomarkers for identifying ISUP grade group 2 cancers suitable for AS. Additionally, the potential of artificial intelligence to improve diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification is examined. By integrating these advancements, this review provides a critical perspective on optimizing AS for more personalized and effective prostate cancer management."
39955738,3D Bioprinted Coaxial Testis Model Using Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells:A Step Toward Bicompartmental Cytoarchitecture and Functionalization.,"Fertility preservation following pediatric cancer therapy programs has become a major avenue of infertility research. In vitro spermatogenesis (IVS) aims to generate sperm from banked prepubertal testicular tissues in a lab setting using specialized culture conditions. While successful using rodent tissues, progress with human tissues is limited by the scarcity of human prepubertal testicular tissues for research. This study posits that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can model human prepubertal testicular tissue to facilitate the development of human IVS conditions. Testicular cells derived from hiPSCs are characterized for phenotype markers and profiled transcriptionally. HiPSC-derived testicular cells are bioprinted into core-shell constructs representative of testis cytoarchitecture and found to capture functional aspects of prepubertal testicular tissues within 7 days under xeno-free conditions. Moreover, hiPSC-derived Sertoli cells illustrate the capacity to mature under pubertal-like conditions. The utility of the model is tested by comparing 2 methods of supplementing retinoic acid (RA), the vitamin responsible for inducing spermatogenesis. The model reveals a significant gain in activity under microsphere-released RA compared to RA medium supplementation, indicating that the fragility of free RA in vitro may be a contributing factor to the molecular dysfunction observed in human IVS studies to date."
39955551,Potential use of DNA methylation in cervical swabs for early ovarian cancer diagnosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, using cost-effective and non-invasive methods remains an unmet medical need, largely due to unspecific symptoms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to identify differentially methylated CpG loci between cervical swabs obtained from patients diagnosed with benign ovarian disease and with malignant pelvic mass. METHODOLOGY: Using Infinium EPICv2 array, we interrogated methylation profiles of 77 cervical swabs. The study cohort was then divided into a training and testing set to develop a diagnostic signature. We applied several strategies to pinpoint CpG sites able to differentiate cervical swabs obtained from ovarian cancer patients and patients with benign ovarian disease. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: None of the statistical methods applied identified CpG loci capable of diagnosing ovarian cancer with sufficient specificity and sensitivity. We conclude that methylation differences observed do not adequately distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian disease. The variations attributable to clinical conditions are likely obscured by the differences in cell composition, which is the primary source of sample heterogeneity. Therefore, we suggest that diagnostic tools should not rely on local methylation profile of the cervix but rather focus on detecting cancer-specific sequences transferred from the tumor site and present in cervical swabs. Ovarian cancer is difficult to detect early, and we aimed to explore whether DNA methylation in cervical swabs could serve as a diagnostic tool. However, our study found that methylation patterns in these samples do not reliably distinguish between benign and malignant conditions, likely due to variations in cell composition. We recommend future research focus on detecting tumor-specific DNA sequences in cervical swabs instead."
39955438,A versatile and efficient method to isolate nuclei from low-input cryopreserved tissues for single-nuclei transcriptomics.,"Clinical samples are vital for understanding diseases, but their scarcity requires refined research methods. Emerging single-cell technologies offer detailed views of tissue heterogeneity but need sufficient fully characterized tissues. We developed an optimized single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) protocol to extract nuclei from just 15 mg of cryopreserved human tissue. Applied to four cancer tissues (brain, bladder, lung, prostate), it profiled 1550-7468 nuclei per tissue, revealing heterogeneity comparable to public single-cell atlases. This method enhances the use and sharing of rare, cryopreserved biospecimens, supporting research where sample quantity is limited and full tissue characterization is needed."
39954255,CRISPR screening identifies regulators of enhancer-mediated androgen receptor transcription in advanced prostate cancer.,"Amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) locus is the most frequent alteration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Recently, it was discovered that an enhancer of the AR is co-amplified with the AR gene body and contributes to increased AR transcription and resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. However, the mechanism of enhancer activation in advanced disease is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify transcription factors that bind to the AR enhancer and modulate enhancer-mediated AR transcription. We demonstrate that HOXB13, GATA2, and TFAP2C bind the AR enhancer in patient-derived xenografts and directly impact features associated with an active chromatin state. Interestingly, the AR enhancer belongs to a set of regulatory elements that require HOXB13 to maintain FOXA1 binding, further delineating the role of HOXB13 in CRPC. This work provides a framework to functionally identify trans-acting factors required for the activation of disease-related noncoding regulatory elements."
39954044,NSUN7 promotes cervical cancer progression through activation of ErbB signaling pathway.,"We aimed to investigate the role of NSUN7 in the progression of Cervical Cancer through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and cell and animal culture experiments. We comprehensively assessed the expression levels of NSUN7 in the TCGA and CCLE databases, and explored its correlations with clinicopathological features, immune cell infiltration, DNA damage repair gene function, drug sensitivity, and methylation status. The NSUN7 gene was disrupted through lentiviral infection, and the effects on cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis were evaluated using CCK-8 assay, Transwell migration assay, and flow cytometry analysis. Gene enrichment analysis wasidentify the biological pathways associated with NSUN7 and cervical cancer development. Additionally, a xenograft model of cervical cancer was established to assess the in vivo inhibitory effect of NSUN7 and its impact on pathway molecules. The results of both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that silencing the NSUN7 gene significantly inhibited the growth, spread, and metastasis of cervical cancer cells, while promoting apoptosis. TUNEL assay and HE staining further verified the apoptotic effect of NSUN7 on tumor tissues, and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of NSUN7 in the ErbB pathway. Silencing of NSUN7 resulted in a significant down-regulation of key ErbB pathway proteins (HER2, STAT5, PI3K/p-PI3K) as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. These findings suggest that NSUN7 may affect the biological behavior of cervical cancer cells and promote tumor development by activating the ErbB signaling pathway."
39950845,Enhancer RNA Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Reveals a Distinctive Class of Pan-Cancer Susceptibility eRNAs.,"Many cancer risk variants are located within enhancer regions and lack sufficient molecular interpretation. Here, we constructed the first comprehensive atlas of enhancer RNA (eRNA)-mediated genetic effects from 28 033 RNA sequencing samples across 11 606 individuals, identifying 21 073 eRNA quantitative trait loci (eRNA-QTLs) significantly associated with eRNA expression. Mechanistically, eRNA-QTLs frequently altered binding motifs of transcription factors. In addition, 28.48% of cancer risk variants are strongly colocalized with eRNA-QTLs. A pan-cancer eRNA-based transcriptome-wide association study is conducted across 23 major cancer types, identifying 626 significant cancer susceptibility eRNAs predicted to modulate cancer risk via eRNA, from which 54.90% of the eRNA target genes are overlooked by traditional gene expression studies, and most are essential for cancer cell proliferation. As proof of principle validation, the enhancer functionality of two newly identified susceptibility eRNAs, CCND1e and SNAPC1e, is confirmed through CRISPR inhibition and shRNA-mediated knockdown, resulting in a marked decrease in the expression of their respective target genes, consequently suppressing the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The study underscores the essential role of eRNA in unveiling new cancer susceptibility genes and establishes a strong framework for enhancing our understanding of human cancer etiology."
39949781,Identification and validation of a novel autoantibody biomarker panel for differential diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"INTRODUCTION: New biomarkers are urgently needed to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at an earlier stage for individualized treatment strategies and to improve outcomes. Autoantibodies (AAbs) in principle make attractive biomarkers as they arise early in disease, report on disease-associated perturbations in cellular proteomes, and are static in response to other common stimuli, yet are measurable in the periphery, potentially well in advance of the onset of clinical symptoms. METHODS: Here, we used high-throughput, custom cancer antigen microarrays to identify a clinically relevant autoantibody biomarker combination able to differentially detect PDAC. Specifically, we quantified the serological AAb profiles of 94 PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP), other pancreatic- (PC) and prostate cancers (PRC), non-ulcer dyspepsia patients (DYS), and healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Combinatorial ROC curve analysis on the training cohort data from the cancer antigen microarrays identified the most effective biomarker combination as CEACAM1-DPPA2-DPPA3-MAGEA4-SRC-TPBG-XAGE3 with an AUC = 85.0% (SE = 0.828, SP = 0.684). Additionally, differential expression analysis on the samples run on the iOme array identified 4 biomarkers (ALX1-GPA33-LIP1-SUB1) upregulated in PDAC against diseased and healthy controls. Identified AAbs were validated in silico using public immunohistochemistry datasets and experimentally using a custom PDAC protein microarray comprising the 11 optimal AAb biomarker panel. The clinical utility of the biomarker panel was tested in an independent cohort comprising 223 PDAC, PC, PRC, colorectal cancer (CRC), and HC samples. Combinatorial ROC curve analysis on the validation data identified the most effective biomarker combination to be CEACAM1-DPPA2-DPPA3-MAGEA4-SRC-TPBG-XAGE3 with an AUC = 85.0% (SE = 0.828, SP = 0.684). Subsequently, the specificity of the 11-biomarker panel was validated against other cancers (PDAC vs PC: AUC = 70.3%; PDAC vs CRC: AUC = 84.3%; PDAC vs PRC: AUC = 80.2%) and healthy controls (PDAC vs HC: AUC = 80.9%), confirming that this novel AAb biomarker panel is able to selectively detect PDAC amongst other confounding diseases. CONCLUSION: This AAb panel may therefore have the potential to form the basis of a novel diagnostic test for PDAC."
39948708,Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 mRNA-Binding Protein 2 (IGF2BP2) Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression by Regulating AR-V7 mRNA Stability.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) splice variant AR-V7 poses a formidable challenge in treating prostate cancer, as it lacks the ligand binding region targeted by androgen-deprivation therapies such as enzalutamide and abiraterone. AR-V7 is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) development and progression; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression and biological function remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of IGF2BP2 in regulating AR-V7 expression and CRPC progression. METHODS: To determine the clinical relevance of IGF2BP2 in CRPC, we analyzed the mRNA expression data for prostate cancer patients available in the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal and cBioPortal. Next to investigate the role of IGF2BP2 in regulating AR-V7 expression and enzalutamide resistance, we performed shRNA-mediated IGF2BP2 knockdown and overexpression experiments followed by qRT-PCR, immunoblot, colony-formation, and MTT assays. Finally, we performed RIP-qPCR, actinomycin-D, and IGF2BP2 domain-deletion analysis to study the mechanism by which IGF2BP2 regulates AR-V7 stability, expression, and enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that IGF2BP2 is upregulated in CRPC patients and its expression positively correlates with increasing Gleason score in patients with CRPC. We demonstrate that IGF2BP2 silencing leads to downregulation of AR-V7 and its downstream target genes without affecting AR levels. Additionally, IGF2BP2 knockdown also enhances the sensitivity of CRPC cells to enzalutamide while overexpression increases AR-V7 expression and confers increased resistance to enzalutamide. Mechanistically, our experiments demonstrate that IGF2BP2 binds to the intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) region of AR-V7, thereby enhancing its mRNA stability. Furthermore, our domain-deletion analysis pinpoints the role of KH3 and KH4 domains of IGF2BP2 in regulating AR-V7 stability and enzalutamide resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that IGF2BP2 plays a critical role in regulating AR-V7 expression and stability, offering a novel target for developing therapeutic interventions for CRPC."
39947118,Treatment switching between Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Acetate and time to oral opioid initiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Enzalutamide (ENZ) and Abiraterone Acetate (AA) are both first-line treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC patients may switch from ENZ to AA or from AA to ENZ, if they do not respond well to the treatment, or experience intolerable side effects. This study examine treatment switching from ENZ to AA or from AA to ENZ, while investigating death as a competing risk. Whether ENZ compared to AA was associated with a longer time to starting oral opioids was also investigated. METHODS: An active comparator new-user design was used to identify 1406 men diagnosed with CRPC who received ENZ and AA using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Linked Database from 2012 to 2016. Inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW)-adjusted Fine-Gray competing risk models were used to compare the switching drugs and time-to-first use of oral opioids after initiating ENZ and AA. RESULTS: Most patients (61 %) received AA, while 39 % received ENZ. Overall, ENZ demonstrated a significant reduction in the Sub-distribution Hazard Ratio (SHR) for switching treatment (IPTW-adjusted SHR 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.54-0.73; P < 0.001), indicating a decrease in treatment switching compared to AA. Cumulative incidence curves revealed substantial differences in switching patterns over time (Gray's test, p < 0.001). For time-to-first oral opioid use, the IPTW-adjusted SHR when comparing ENZ to AA was 0.95 (95 % CI, 0.83-1.09; P = 0.48), showing no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Patients who began their treatment with ENZ exhibited a substantially lower hazard of switching to AA when compared to those who started with AA."
39946775,Dietary inflammatory index predicts cancer mortality in male patients but not female patients: Results from NHANES 1999 to 2014.,"This study explored sex differences between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and cancer prognosis and their mechanisms. We hypothesized that association between dietary inflammatory index and cancer prognosis differs by sex. The study included 2874 adults with cancer from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey covering 1999 to 2014. Mortality status was linked to National Death Index mortality data through 31 December 2019. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to calculate hazard risk and 95% confidence intervals (Cis) in male patients and female patients. Sex-specific cancer and nonsex-specific cancer subgroup analyses were performed, and the role of C-reactive protein in sex differences was analyzed. The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer transcriptome data were combined to explore the biological mechanisms of the sex differences. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher DII in male patients correlated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard risk highest vs lowest quartile = 1.57 [95% confidence intervals 1.24-1.98]; P for trend <.01), but not in female patients (P = .44). For sex-specific cancers, higher DII potentially correlated with increased mortality in prostate cancer (unadjusted P for trend = .04), but not in breast (P = .83), ovarian (P = .49), or cervical cancers (P = .91). In melanoma and colon cancer, higher DII correlated with increased mortality in male patients but not female patients. Serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-1 binding, interleukin-35 pathway, and programmed cell death protein 1 pathway may contribute to these sex differences. In conclusion, sex differences exist between DII and mortality risk in cancer patients."
39946051,"Analysis of microarray and single-cell RNA-seq identifies gene co-expression, cell-cell communication, and tumor environment associated with metabolite interconversion enzyme in prostate cancer.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignant neoplasm in males and is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Due to the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and improved biopsy techniques, persons identified with early-stage prostate cancer often have a positive prognosis after comprehensive treatment. Nonetheless, prostate cancer is a latent illness that may present as an asymptomatic tumor in individuals aged 20-30. The overall survival (OS) of men with advanced PCa is significantly diminished. Consequently, there is an immediate want for innovative, accurate biomarkers to detect early prostate cancer. METHODS: This research analyzed the interaction network of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to metabolite interconversion enzymes in PCa by gene expression microarray data, single-cell RNA sequencing, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) utilizing bioinformatics techniques. This kind of analysis has not been documented in prior studies. RESULTS: We then used a dataset acquired by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to confirm our findings. Genes including CYP3A5, PDE8B, AOX1, BNIPL, FADS2, RRM2, ALDH3B2, and GSTM2 may be significant in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. CONCLUSION: Our objective was to provide new perspectives on the molecular properties and pathways of DEGs in PCa and to uncover potential biomarkers that play a crucial role in the genesis and progression of PCa."
39946028,Identification of differentially expressed MiRNA clusters in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with cervical cancer (CC) progression. The present study aimed to identify the miRNA clusters (MCs) altered in CC, identify their clinical utility, and understand their biological functions via computational analysis. METHODS: We used small RNA sequencing and qRT‒PCR to identify and validate abnormally expressed MCs in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) samples. We compared our data with publicly available CC datasets to identify the differentially expressed MCs in CC. The potential targets, pathways, biological functions, and clinical utility of abnormally expressed MCs were predicted via several computational tools. RESULTS: Small RNA sequencing revealed that 229 miRNAs belonging to 48 MCs were significantly differentially expressed in CSCC (p-value </= 0.05). Validation by qRT‒PCR confirmed the downregulation of members of the miR-379/656, namely, hsa-miR-376c-3p (2.8-fold; p-value 0.03), hsa-miR-494-3p (3.4-fold; p-value 0.02), hsa-miR-495-3p (eightfold; p-value 0.01), and hsa-miR-409-3p (fivefold; p-value 0.03), in CSCC samples compared with normal samples. The prognostic model generated via miRNA expression and random forest analysis showed robust sensitivity and specificity (0.88 to 0.92) in predicting overall survival. In addition, we report 22 prognostically important miRNAs in CC. Pathway analysis revealed the enrichment of several cancer-related pathways, notably p53, the cell cycle, viral infection and MAPK signalling. CDC25A, CCNE1, E2F1, CCNE2, RBL1, E2F3, CDK2, RBL2, E2F2 and CCND2 were identified as the top ten gene targets of MC. Drug‒gene interaction analysis revealed enrichment of 548 approved drugs and 62 unique genes. CONCLUSION: Our study identified MCs, their target genes, their prognostic utility, and their potential functions in CC and recommended their usefulness in CC management."
39945744,The Germline and Somatic Origins of Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity.,"Newly diagnosed prostate cancers differ dramatically in mutational composition and lethality. The most accurate clinical predictor of lethality is tumor tissue architecture, quantified as tumor grade. To interrogate the evolutionary origins of prostate cancer heterogeneity, we analyzed 666 prostate tumor whole genomes. We identified a compendium of 223 recurrently mutated driver regions, most influencing downstream mutational processes and gene expression. We identified and validated individual germline variants that predispose tumors to acquire specific somatic driver mutations: these explain heterogeneity in disease presentation and ancestry differences. High-grade tumors have a superset of the drivers in lower-grade tumors, including increased frequency of BRCA2 and MYC mutations. Grade-associated driver mutations occur early in tumor evolution, and their earlier occurrence strongly predicts cancer relapse and metastasis. Our data suggest high- and low-grade prostate tumors both emerge from a common pre-malignant field, influenced by germline genomic context and stochastic mutation-timing."

39945255,Prediction of the Prognosis and Treatment Responses Based on the Characteristics of Disulfidptosis-Related Genes in Patients with Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Disulfidptosis is a new type of regulatory cell death (RCD), but the pathophysiological functions and mechanisms of DRGs in CESC remain to be examined. AIMS: This study explored the mutation status of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). OBJECTIVE: After analyzing the mutation profiles of DRGs in CESC, this study established a prognostic model for CESC and also explored the differences in immune infiltration (accumulation of immune system cells in tissues or organs), related enriched pathways, and drug sensitivity between high-risk and low-risk CESC groups. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were accessed to source related data. The mutation profiles of DRGs in CESC were analyzed using Mutect2 software, and disulfidptosis scores were calculated by ssGSEA. WGCNA was performed to identify modular genes, which were further filtered and used to formulate a risk model by applying the survival and glmnet packages. Low- and high-risk groups of CESC patients were classified using the survminer package. GSEA was performed to conduct pathway analysis, and immune infiltration was assessed using the MCPcounter package, ESTIMATE, and TIMER algorithms. Finally, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity were analyzed using the TIDE method and the pRRophetic package, respectively. RESULTS: Except for NDUFA11, ARL6IP5, EPM2AIP1, GBE1, RBM38, ULK4, and ZBTB47 were found to be the DRGs significantly mutated in CESC. The six genes were integrated to develop a RiskScore model with a relatively high Area Under the Curve (AUC) value. Significant differences between the two risk groups were determined, indicating that the model was highly reliable. Notably, the low-risk group was enriched in energy metabolism-correlated pathways, while the high-risk group was primarily enriched in immune-correlated pathways. The high-risk group showed higher immune cell activity, higher TIDE score, and more B cells than the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity study revealed that the high-risk group was more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs. CONCLUSION: This study provides novel insights into CESC prognosis, immunotherapy, and drug development, contributing to the clinical treatment for CESC."
39944833,Transcriptome profiling revealed multiple circadian rhythm-related genes associated with common gynecological cancers.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that more than half of the human genome expression is affected by circadian rhythms, which includes genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair and apoptosis that are critical in cancer biology. However, the roles of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRRGs) in cervical cancer (CC) and other common gynecologic cancers remain unclear. METHODS: The transcriptome data and clinical information related to CC and other common gynecologic cancers were extracted from the UCSC Xena and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. In this study, the differentially expressed CRRGs of CC (target genes) were obtained, and the functional enrichment analysis of these target genes was performed by ""clusterProfiler"". Then, the biomarkers of CC were screened out to construct the survival risk model (risk score). Moreover, function and tumor micro-environment (TME) analyses in different risk groups were performed for further study of the potential mechanism of CC. Furthermore, the prognostic value and function analyses of biomarkers in three common gynecologic cancers were performed to reveal the potential agreement or heterogeneity regulations. RESULTS: A total of 19 target genes were associated with pyrimidine metabolism. The survival risk model was constructed with six biomarkers, including APOBEC3B, CDA, HELLS, RHOB, SLC15A3, and UPP1. Among these, APOBEC3B, HELLS, and SLC15A3 were identified as positive factors, while CDA, RHOB, and UPP1 were identified as negative factors in CC. It is notable that multiple immune-related signaling pathways were associated with the clinical risk of CC, and the immunotherapy sensitivity was worse in the high-risk group. In addition, we found that most of biomarkers had the prognostic values in other common gynecologic cancers. It was notable that the mechanisms by which these biomarkers influence gynecologic cancers were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, focal adhesion, etc. CONCLUSION: This study identified six circadian rhythm-related biomarkers, including APOBEC3B, CDA, HELLS, RHOB, SLC15A3, and UPP1, which were associated with the prognosis of CC. The mechanisms by which these biomarkers influence gynecologic cancers were associated with ECM receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and other functions. These findings might help to deepen the understanding of the agreement or heterogeneity of CRRGs in the pathological processes of common gynecologic cancers."
39944790,Macrophage migration inhibitory factor in inflammasome formation and macrophage recruitment by cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells.,"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies in various types of cancer, their efficacy in cervical cancer is limited. A crucial pro-inflammatory cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), is highly expressed in various types of cancers and contributes to tumor progression via the regulation of inflammatory responses and the tumor microenvironment. The present study aimed to explore the role of MIF in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Cell-Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to investigate the effects of MIF on CSCC progression and in the formation of inflammasomes using SiHa cells. Transcriptome and proteome sequencing were combined to screen for key effector proteins of MIF. Moreover, in vitro co-culture experiments were used to evaluate the roles of MIF and TSC22 domain family protein 3 (TSC22D3) as inflammatory tumor-promoting factors in macrophage recruitment and polarization induction. The results indicated that MIF was highly expressed in CSCC with lymph node metastasis, positively associated with cervical cancer stage, and associated with a poor prognosis. MIF was also found to promote the progression of CSCC cells and to be associated with inflammasome activation. Multi-omics screening results indicated that TSC22D3 may be an important MIF interacting factor. Moreover, MIF and TSC22D3 facilitated inflammasome activation, THP-1 cell migration and M2 polarization. Therefore, it is suggested that MIF and TSC22D3 may induce macrophage infiltration in cervical cancer lesions and affect the tumor microenvironment by polarizing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting CSCC progression. The present study highlights the potential of the MIF-TSC22D3 axis as a novel therapeutic target, which could conceivably help to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer."
39943705,Dysregulation of G6PD by HPV E6 exacerbates cervical cancer by activating the STAT3/PLOD2 pathway.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is strongly linked to the initiation and progression of cervical cancer, yet the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain partially understood. This investigation examined differential protein expression profiles in various cohorts, including healthy controls and HPV-positive cervical cancer patients with different expression levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), shedding light on the dysregulation of oncogenic proteins by HPV. Proteomic analysis of cervical tissues revealed specific protein signatures, indicating significant upregulation of HPV E6, G6PD, STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3, and procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2) in HPV-infected cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments, involving the manipulation of G6PD and STAT3 activities in cervical cancer cells with HPV E6 modulation, demonstrated that dysregulated G6PD enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while suppressing apoptosis, primarily through the STAT3/PLOD2 pathway. Integrating these findings with the existing literature underscores the role of G6PD as an oncogene, potentially under STAT3 regulation, and highlights the role of PLOD2 as a pivotal factor in cervical cancer progression. This study also proposed a mechanism in which HPV E6-induced dysregulation of G6PD activates the STAT3-PLOD2 axis to promote cervical cancer progression. Understanding the intricate interplay between HPV E6, G6PD, STAT3, and PLOD2 offers valuable insights into the molecular landscape of cervical cancer. These findings may pave the way for targeted therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting this axis to mitigate the progression of cervical cancer."
39941889,A New Blood-Based Epigenetic Diagnostic Biomarker Test (EpiSwitch((R)(R)) NST) with High Sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value for Colorectal Cancer and Precancerous Polyps.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from the epithelial lining of the colon or rectum, often following a progression from benign adenomatous polyps to malignant carcinoma. Screening modalities such as colonoscopy, faecal immunochemical tests (FIT), and FIT-DNA are critical for early detection and prevention, but non-invasive methods lack sensitivity to polyps and early CRC. Chromosome conformations (CCs) are potent epigenetic regulators of gene expression. We have previously developed an epigenetic assay, EpiSwitch((R)(R)), that employs an algorithmic-based CCs analysis. Using EpiSwitch((R)(R)) technology, we have shown the presence of cancer-specific CCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and primary tumours of patients with melanoma and prostate cancer. EpiSwitch((R)(R))-based commercial tests are now available to diagnose prostate cancer with 94% accuracy (PSE test) and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors across 14 cancers with 85% accuracy (CiRT test). Methods/Results/Conclusions: Using blood samples collected from n = 171 patients with CRC, n = 44 patients with colorectal polyps and n = 110 patients with a 'clear' colonoscopy we performed whole Genome DNA screening for CCs correlating to CRC diagnosis. Our findings suggest the presence of two eight-marker CC signatures (EpiSwitch((R)(R)) NST) in whole blood that allow diagnosis of CRC and precancerous polyps, respectively. Independent validation cohort testing demonstrated high accuracy in identifying colorectal polyps and early versus late stages of CRC with an exceptionally high sensitivity of 79-90% and a high positive prediction value of 60-84%. Linking the top diagnostic CCs to nearby genes, we have built pathways maps that likely underline processes contributing to the pathology of polyp and CRC progression, including TGFbeta, cMYC, Rho GTPase, ROS, TNFa/NFkappaB, and APC."
39941722,Inhibition of Galectin-1 and Androgen Receptor Axis Enhances Enzalutamide Treatment in Enzalutamide Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a prevalent and deadly disease, particularly in its advanced stages. Despite various available treatments, resistance to drugs like enzalutamide continues to present significant challenges. This study aimed to investigate the role of Galectin-1 (Gal-1) in enzalutamide-resistant PCa and assess its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome resistance. METHODS: The study utilized specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gal-1 in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells to evaluate its effects on cell proliferation and response to enzalutamide treatment. An orthotopic mouse model was employed to examine the in vivo impact of Gal-1 knockdown. Pharmacological targeting of Gal-1 was conducted using LLS30, and its effects were assessed both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects. RESULTS: The findings demonstrated significant upregulation of Gal-1 in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. Gal-1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and resensitized resistant cells to enzalutamide treatment in the orthotopic mouse model. Elevated levels of androgen receptor full-length and AR-V7 are key mechanisms under-lying resistance to enzalutamide in PCa. Gal-1 knockdown suppressed AR and AR-V7 expression and their transcriptional activity. Treatment with LLS30 significantly suppressed the growth of enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells and exhibited synergistic effects when combined with enzalutamide. Notably, this combination therapy significantly inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant xenografts in vivo. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LLS30 modulates AR and AR-V7 signaling through the inhibition of associated target genes. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight Gal-1 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming enzalutamide resistance in PCa. Targeting the Gal-1/AR/AR-V7 axis with LLS30 presents a novel strategy to enhance enzalutamide efficacy and address drug resistance in advanced PCa."
39941131,Integrating Hypoxia Signatures from scRNA-seq and Bulk Transcriptomes for Prognosis Prediction and Precision Therapy in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma.,"Hypoxia, a common feature in many malignancies, is particularly prominent in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). Investigating the mechanisms underlying hypoxia is essential for understanding the heterogeneity of CESC and developing personalized therapeutic regimens. Firstly, the CESC-specific hypoxia gene sets shared between single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk data were identified through Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA)and FindMarkers analyses. A CESC-specific hypoxia-related score (CSHRS) risk model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)and Cox regression analyses based on these genes. The prognostic differences were analyzed in terms of immune infiltration, mutations, and drug resistance. Finally, a nomogram model was constructed by integrating clinicopathological features to facilitate precision treatment for CESC. This study constructed a CSHRS risk model that divides patients into two groups, and this model can comprehensively evaluate the tumor microenvironment characteristics of CESC, provide accurate prognostic predictions, and offer rational treatment options for patients."
39941009,"Allele-Specific CG/CCWGG Methylation of the PSA Promoter Discriminates Aggressive, Indolent, and Benign Prostate Cell Lines and Is Involved in the Regulation of PSA Expression.","Prostate-specific antigen remains a cornerstone biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis and management. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating its expression, particularly through DNA methylation, are not fully understood. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of allele-specific CpG and CCWGG methylation in the proximal PSA promoter across aggressive (PC3), indolent (LNCaP), benign (BPH1), and normal (HPrEpiC) prostate cell lines and provide insights into the unique methylation patterns associated with these states. Our findings reveal that PC3 cells, representing an aggressive PCa phenotype, exhibit complete biallelic methylation of the PSA promoter, leading to PSA gene silencing. Conversely, LNCaP cells display a fully unmethylated promoter with biallelic PSA expression. Interestingly, BPH1 cells display a monoallelic CG/CCWGG methylation pattern, yet fail to express PSA, suggesting imprinting defects or RNA decay mechanisms. Notably, acquisition of biallelic PSA promoter methylation status in PC3 was accompanied by upregulation of DNMT1, whereas unmethylated PSA promoter state in LNCaP was associated with downregulation of DNMT1. These findings highlight distinct methylation patterns in the PSA promoter that differentiate between aggressive, indolent, and benign prostate states. Translating this epigenetic insight into clinical diagnostics could enhance the precision of PSA-based diagnostics, addressing limitations such as false negatives in PSA testing for aggressive PCa. Further exploration of CCWGG methylation's role in imprinting and monoallelic expression is warranted, particularly in patient-derived samples."
39940865,TMEM160 Promotes Tumor Growth in Lung Adenocarcinoma and Cervical Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.,"The Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) is an international initiative. It aims to create a protein list expressed in human cells by each chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms, akin to the gene list generated by the Human Genome Project. Transmembrane protein 160 (TMEM160) is a member of the transmembrane proteins (TMEM) family. TMEM proteins have been implicated in cancer-related processes, including cell proliferation, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the role of TMEM160 in non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer using cell lines, clinical samples, and xenograft studies. Our findings demonstrated that TMEM160 knockdown decreased the proliferation of lung and cervical cancer cell lines. We observed that TMEM160 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and dynamic localization during mitosis of cancer cells and discovered a novel interaction between TMEM160 and nuclear proteins such as NUP50. Furthermore, the TMEM160 interactome was enriched in processes associated with apical junctions, xenobiotic metabolism, glycolysis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reactive oxygen species, UV response DNA, the P53 pathway, and the mitotic spindle. This study provides an initial understanding of the function of TMEM160 in lung and cervical cancer progression and clarifies the need to continue investigating the participation of TMEM160 in these cancers."
39939864,Nomogram for predicting the risk of cervical lymph node metastases and recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma based on the thyroid differentiation score system and clinical characteristics.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify independent predictors of cervical central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), cervical lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM), and recurrence in patients with PTC, which could help guide the surgical management of these patients. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from 542 patients with PTC, who underwent thyroid surgery and were enrolled in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of cervical LNM, classified as CLNM or LLNM. Data were randomly partitioned into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. Age, sex, thyroid differentiation score (TDS), and other relevant attributes, were compared between the two groups using univariate and multivariate analyses and reported as odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Independent predictors were identified and used to develop nomograms. To assess the accuracy, discrimination, and clinical utility of the prediction model, calibration, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed for both the training and validation sets. RESULTS: Of the 542 patients, 261 (48.15%) and 130 (23.99%) presented with CLNM and LLNM, respectively. The analyses identified several independent predictors for CLNM, including the presence of extrathyroidal invasion (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.60-4.00), larger tumor dimension (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.34), age over 55 years (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.82), non-classic papillary subtype (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.61), and lower TDS (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76). A greater number of excised cervical LNs (OR 12.30, 95% CI 4.35-34.77), the presence of CLNM (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and lower TDS (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.21) were independent predictors for LLNM. Additionally, the independent predictors for relapse included age greater than 55 years (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.49) and lower TDS (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.62). These predictors were used to develop nomograms for CLNM, LLNM, and recurrence. ROC and DCA confirmed the discrimination and clinical utility of the models. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified independent predictors of cervical CLNM, LLNM, and recurrence. Clinically relevant nomograms were developed that can assist in guiding cervical lymph node dissection and prediction of recurrence in patients with PTC."
39937573,PTPN9 promotes melanoma progression by regulating the ferroptosis pathway.,"In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the incidence and mortality rates of melanoma, posing a significant threat to human health and life. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPNs) have been implicated in the progression of various human cancers, including breast, lung, and cervical cancer. To investigate PTPN9 expression in melanoma, impacting the disease's survival and prognosis. Our study, which involved an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database and immunohistochemical staining of pathological sections, identified an upregulation of PTPN9 expression in melanoma, impacting the disease's survival and prognosis. At the cellular level, we investigated the effects of PTPN9 on the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells. Through various experimental techniques such as Western blot protein detection, electron microscopy, and oil red O staining, we observed that PTPN9 potentially contributes to the development of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) by regulating ferroptosis-related proteins ACSL4, FTH1, and P53, thereby influencing lipid metabolism. The results of this study highlight the unique role of PTPN9 in SKCM and suggest its potential as a biomarker for the disease."
39936957,Vesicles Secreted by Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells Cause Vascular Endothelial Cells to Express PSMA and Drive Tumor Progression.,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) protein expression is induced during prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Recently, we reported that PSMA-positive vesicles released by prostate cancer cell lines enhanced vascular endothelial cell angiogenesis and that PSMA may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. Similarly, it is known that PSMA is upregulated in peritumoral vessels in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In this study, we investigated the significance and molecular function of PSMA in RCC. PSMA immunohistochemical staining confirmed PSMA presence only in perinephric tumor vessels, and PSMA intensity was strongly correlated with recurrence rate and venous invasion. Spatial gene expression analysis revealed that FOLH1 expression, which codes PSMA, was upregulated in tumor blood vessels around renal cancer, and that angiogenesis-related pathways were enhanced. The 10,000 g pellet fraction of the renal cancer cell lines Caki1- and ACHN-conditioned medium (CM) induced PSMA positivity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and enhanced tube formation. Mass spectrometry indicated that the 10,000 g pellet fraction contained various kinds of growth factors, like GDF15 and MYDGF. RNA sequencing showed that supplementing HUVECs with RCC cell CM-enhanced angiogenesis-related signaling pathways. Conclusively, microvesicle components secreted by RCC cells transform vascular endothelial cells into PSMA-positive cells, enhancing angiogenesis."
39935910,Comprehensive Genome Profiling Test in Japanese Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents a significant difficulty in oncology, with limited treatment options and decreasing survival rates. The comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) test has appeared as a promising tool for personalizing treatment according to the genetic characteristics of tumors. In Japan, the incidence of prostate cancer (PC) has sharply increased, making it crucial to investigate effective therapies informed by genomic data. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data from 30 patients who underwent the CGP test at Kanazawa University from March 2020 to February 2024. Patient information, including age, clinical stage, and previous treatments, was collected. The CGP tests were conducted on the tumor and blood specimens using FoundationOne(R) CDx. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, with a significance level set at a p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: Genomic mutations were detected in 27 patients (90%), predominantly TP53 (19 cases) and PTEN mutations (10 cases). Five patients received treatment based on the CGP results but with no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the treated and untreated groups (p = 0.72). Notably, patients with CDK12 mutations demonstrated a significantly shorter OS (p = 0.032). Pembrolizumab in cases with high tumor mutation burden exhibited limited efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The CGP test revealed critical genetic mutations in patients with CRPC and highlighted the poor prognosis associated with CDK12 mutations. The results underscore the necessity for novel therapies tailored to these genetic profiles, emphasizing the role of the CGP in improving treatment personalization."
39935692,Mendelian randomization analysis reveals genetic evidence for a causal link between inflammatory bowel disease and uterine cervical neoplasms.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported to be associated with risk of uterine cervical neoplasm. We aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between IBD and uterine cervical neoplasm using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. METHODS: We derived instrumental variables for IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, from the IEU Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) database, and for the histological subtypes of uterine cervical neoplasm from the FinnGen repository's GWAS data. The collected GWAS data predominantly represent individuals of European ancestry. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as primary analysis approach. RESULTS: IBD (IVW odds ratio = 1.127, 95% confidence interval = 1.016-1.251; p = 0.024) and CD (IVW odds ratio = 1.119, 95% confidence interval = 1.023-1.224; p = 0.014) exhibited a significant causal effect on malignant cervical carcinoma. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Genetically predicted IBD and CD are risk factors for the development of malignant cervical carcinoma. Patients with IBD and CD require specific attention to prevent cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms may reveal new therapeutic targets."
39934021,The emerging regulatory interface between DNA repair and steroid hormone receptors in cancer.,"Human cells potentiate highly diverse functions through tight transcriptional regulation and maintenance of genome integrity. While the DNA damage response (DDR) safeguards the genome, ligand-activated transcription factors, such as steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), provide complex transcriptional outputs. Interestingly, an increasing body of evidence reveals a direct biological and functional interplay between DDR factors and SHR cascades in cancer. SHRs can directly affect DDR gene expression, but DDR factors in turn act as transcriptional coregulators, enabling oncogenic SHR-mediated signaling, which has the potential for novel therapeutic interventions. With a focus on breast and prostate cancer, we describe in this review recent developments in, and insights into, the complex interplay between SHR signaling and the DDR, highlighting opportunities for future clinical interventions."
39933395,Identification of potential drug targets for four site-specific cancers by integrating human plasma proteome with genome.,"Drug targets supported by genetic evidence with a several-fold higher probability of success in clinical trials. We performed a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify causal proteins and potential therapeutic targets for four site-specific cancers. A total of 13,248 protein quantitative trait loci for 4853 plasma proteins were utilized for proteome-wide MR analysis. Identification of cancer causal proteins in the discovery cohort and further validation in the replication cohort. Colocalization, summary-data-based MR (SMR) analysis, and transcriptome‑wide association studies (TWAS) were performed to check the accuracy of the candidate proteins. Two-step MR analysis was used to explore the effects of plasma protein-mediated 248 modifiable factors on cancer. Phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis, druggability evaluation, and single-cell type expression analysis further assessed the potential of causal proteins. Combining the results of the meta-analysis of MR estimates from the two cohorts, 21, 2, 24 and 1 causal proteins were identified in breast, lung, prostate and stomach cancers, respectively. Evidence from colocalization, SMR analysis, and TWAS highlighted CD36, DNPH1, and PLXND1 as the most promising drug targets for breast cancer, and ZNF175 for prostate cancer. 1 new potential biomarker (PLXND1) for breast cancer, 2 new promising targets (RELL1, DEFB119) for lung cancer, and 8 new circulating biomarkers (ARFIP2, CCN6, CTRB2, HTR7, MRPL33, TNFRSF6B, VAMP5, ZNF175) for prostate cancer were firstly reported. Some plasma proteins may mediate the association of these cancers with other systemic diseases. Additionally, genetically predicted higher BMI and overweight may reduce breast cancer risk by altering CASP8, ADM, PLXND1, TNFRSF9, ULK3 and VSIG4 protein levels. Causal proteins of breast and prostate cancer were expressed predominantly on macrophages in cancerous tissues. This study genetically identified several cancer causal proteins which provided new perspectives for the understanding of the etiology and development of novel targeted drugs for cancer."
39932457,"Characterization of plasma cell-free DNA variants as of tumor- or clonal hematopoiesis-origin in 16,812 advanced cancer patients.","PURPOSE: Plasma-based liquid biopsy tests can detect tumor-specific genetic alterations and offer many advantages that complement tissue-based Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP). However, age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations can confound liquid biopsy results and potentially lead to incorrect therapy choice. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the landscape of 16,812 liquid profiles across 49 cancer types using the Caris Assure assay, a whole exome and whole transcriptome NGS workflow that independently sequences both plasma-derived cell-free total nucleic acids (cfTNA) as well as the white blood cell DNA and RNA from the buffy coat. The variant source was identified algorithmically by comparing plasma and buffy coat variant frequency and read quality metrics. RESULTS: 42.3% of 16,812 patients presented at least one CH variant among reportable clinical genes. We found 39% of BRCA2 variants to be of CH origin, as well as 37.9% of CHEK2, 27.4% of BRCA1, 20.1% of ATM, 7.3% NRAS, 5.8% BRAF, 2.1% EGFR, 2.1% KRAS, and 18.5% TP53. For patients aged 65-69, the median proportion of CH variant classification was 20%, whereas it was 33% for patients aged 70-74, 33% for ages 75-79, and 50% for ages 80+. We found high rates of CH detected in what would be otherwise druggable targets in many cancer types typically treated with PARP inhibitors, including breast, female genital tract, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and endometrial cancers. CONCLUSION: This large study highlights the need for thorough CH classification during liquid biopsy to appropriately recommend therapies, especially PARP inhibitors."
39931528,"CircPRMT5, a Potential Salivary Biomarker, Facilitates the Progression of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via the IGF2BP3-SERPINE1 Pathway.","PURPOSE: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with the progression of tumors and hold promise as potential biomarkers for liquid biopsy. Among these, the role of circPRMT5 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains to be elucidated. This study aims to examine the role and underlying mechanisms of circPRMT5 in the progression of HNSCC and to assess its potential diagnostic value in saliva exosomes. METHODS: The expression of circPRMT5 and its clinical significance in HNSCC were investigated. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to elucidate the biological role of circPRMT5 in HNSCC. RNA sequencing was utilized to identify downstream mechanisms. To evaluate and validate these mechanisms, Western blotting, RNA-FISH, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RIP, and rescue experiments were employed. Finally, salivary exosomes were isolated, and the expression levels of circPRMT5 were assessed using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: The upregulation of circPRMT5 in HNSCC tissues was identified to be correlated with cervical lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical T stage. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments manifested that circPRMT5 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of HNSCC. Mechanistically, circPRMT5 was demonstrated to directly bind to and stabilize the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), which, subsequently, binds to and stabilizes the serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) mRNA, thereby enhancing SERPINE1 expression. Furthermore, rescue experiments indicated that the proliferative, invasive, and migratory effects of circPRMT5 in HNSCC were dependent on the involvement of IGF2BP3 and SERPINE1. Notably, circPRMT5 levels were significantly elevated in the saliva exosomes of HNSCC patients, exhibiting substantial diagnostic value. CONCLUSION: CircPRMT5 exhibits significant diagnostic utility through salivary exosomes and plays a crucial role in promoting the progression of HNSCC via the IGF2BP3-SERPINE1 pathway. These findings highlight the potential of circPRMT5 as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for patients with HNSCC."
39931470,Amorphous calcium phosphate-coated surfaces as a model for bone microenvironment in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Bone metastasis remains one of the biggest challenges in the treatment of prostate cancer, and other solid tumors such as breast, lung, and colon. Modeling a complex microenvironment in-vitro such as the bone niche, requires interrogation of cell-cell interactions, specific extracellular matrix proteins, and a high calcium environment. METHODS: Here, we present a fast and cost-effective system in which commercially available, non-adhesive cell culture vessels are coated with amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) as a surrogate for bone matrix. We also present modified protocols for subculturing cells and collecting nucleic acids and protein in high-calcium samples. RESULTS: We find that prostate epithelial cell lines show increased adhesion and proliferation when cultured in these amorphous calcium surfaces, accompanied by independence from androgen starvation. We observe gene expression changes on ACP surfaces in early adenocarcinoma cell lines which match alterations relevant to prostate cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating biologically relevant in-vitro systems that address the microenvironment milieu of the metastatic site is essential for accurately modeling cancer progression. In the case of bone metastasis, calcium availability, uptake, and downstream signaling are of paramount importance for the survival of the cancer cell and should be considered in the development of pre-clinical models."
39930792,Serum Matrix Metalloproteinases and Risk of Urologic Cancers: A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Many observational epidemiological studies have reported an association between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urologic cancers. However, the causal relationship between these two phenotypes remains uncertain. This study aims to examine the bidirectional causal relationship between serum MMPs and three urologic cancers: kidney, prostate, and bladder cancer. Using data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we employed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to assess the causal relationship between serum MMPs and urologic cancers. We performed inverse variance-weighted MR as the primary method for calculating the overall effects of multiple instruments, while implementing additional MR methods and sensitivity analyses. Odds ratios (ORs) were employed to evaluate the causal relationship between serum MMPs and urologic cancers risk. Our findings indicated a causal relationship between serum MMP-3 levels and prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.02, 1.11], p = .003). There was a possible causal relationship between serum MMP-1 and prostate cancer (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = [0.92, 0.99], p = .02). Serum MMP-1 may also increase the risk of bladder cancer (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.49], p = .016). We did not find significant associations of the remaining MMPs with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. In reverse MR, no significant results were observed supporting the effect of urologic cancers on MMPs (p > .05). Our study provides evidence of a potential causal relationship between serum MMPs and both prostate cancer and bladder cancer. However, large-scale studies are necessary to confirm and reveal the underlying mechanisms of this association."
39930651,The Role of Viruses in Cellular Transformation and Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections are established contributors to oncogenesis, leading to significant public health challenges. This systematic review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the mechanisms of viral cellular transformation and their association with various cancers. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies reveal key mechanisms of oncogenesis, including direct viral integration into the host genome, expression of viral oncogenes, and indirect pathways such as chronic inflammation and immune evasion. Notably, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) was linked predominantly to cervical and oropharyngeal cancers, while Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) was associated with lymphomas. Hepatitis B and C viruses were linked to liver cancer, highlighting the diverse impacts of viral infections on oncogenic processes. CONCLUSIONS: This review underscores the complexity of viral interactions with host cells and their implications for cancer development. Findings suggest that targeted interventions, such as vaccination and antiviral therapies, may play a crucial role in reducing the incidence of virus-related cancers. Further research is needed to explore novel therapeutic strategies and the role of co-factors in viral oncogenesis."
39930364,Gene-based Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test using genotype count data: application to six types of cancers.,"BACKGROUND: An alternative approach to investigate associations between genetic variants and disease is to examine deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in genotype frequencies within a case population, instead of case-control association analysis. The HWE analysis requires disease cases and demonstrates a notable ability in mapping recessive variants. Allelic heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in diseases. While gene-based case-control association analysis successfully incorporates this heterogeneity, there are no such approaches for HWE analysis. Therefore, we proposed a gene-based HWE test (gene-HWT) by aggregating single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level HWE test statistics in a gene to address allelic heterogeneity. RESULTS: This method used only genotype count data and publicly available linkage disequilibrium information and has a very low computational cost. Extensive simulations demonstrated that gene-HWT effectively controls the type I error at a low significance level and outperforms SNP-level HWE test in power when there are multiple causal variants within a gene. Using gene-HWT, we analyzed genotype count data from a genome-wide association study of six cancer types in Japanese individuals and suggest DGKE and ANO3 as potential germline factors in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, FSTL4 was suggested through a combined analysis across the six cancer types, with particularly notable associations observed in colorectal and prostate cancers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the potential of gene-HWT to elucidate the genetic basis of complex diseases, including cancer."
39930085,"Genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen levels in 392,522 men identifies new loci and improves prediction across ancestry groups.","We conducted a multiancestry genome-wide association study of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in 296,754 men (211,342 European ancestry, 58,236 African ancestry, 23,546 Hispanic/Latino and 3,630 Asian ancestry; 96.5% of participants were from the Million Veteran Program). We identified 318 independent genome-wide significant (P </= 5 x 10(-8)) variants, 184 of which were novel. Most demonstrated evidence of replication in an independent cohort (n = 95,768). Meta-analyzing discovery and replication (n = 392,522) identified 447 variants, of which a further 111 were novel. Out-of-sample variance in PSA explained by our genome-wide polygenic risk scores ranged from 11.6% to 16.6% for European ancestry, 5.5% to 9.5% for African ancestry, 13.5% to 18.2% for Hispanic/Latino and 8.6% to 15.3% for Asian ancestry and decreased with increasing age. Midlife genetically adjusted PSA levels were more strongly associated with overall and aggressive prostate cancer than unadjusted PSA levels. Our study highlights how including proportionally more participants from underrepresented populations improves genetic prediction of PSA levels, offering potential to personalize prostate cancer screening."
39929823,Breakage fusion bridge cycles drive high oncogene number with moderate intratumoural heterogeneity.,"Oncogene amplification is a key driver of cancer pathogenesis. Both breakage fusion bridge (BFB) cycles and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can lead to high oncogene copy numbers, but the impact of BFB amplifications on intratumoral heterogeneity, treatment response, and patient survival remains poorly understood due to detection challenges with DNA sequencing. We introduce an algorithm, OM2BFB, designed to detect and reconstruct BFB amplifications using optical genome mapping (OGM). OM2BFB demonstrates high precision (>93%) and recall (92%) in identifying BFB amplifications across cancer cell lines, patient-derived xenograft models, and primary tumors. Comparisons using OGM reveal that BFB detection with our AmpliconSuite toolkit for short-read sequencing also achieves high precision, though with reduced sensitivity. We identify 371 BFB events through whole genome sequencing of 2557 primary tumors and cancer cell lines. BFB amplifications are prevalent in cervical, head and neck, lung, and esophageal cancers, but rare in brain cancers. Genes amplified through BFB exhibit lower expression variance, with limited potential for regulatory adaptation compared to ecDNA-amplified genes. Tumors with BFB amplifications (BFB(+)) show reduced structural heterogeneity in amplicons and delayed resistance onset relative to ecDNA(+) tumors. These findings highlight ecDNA and BFB amplifications as distinct oncogene amplification mechanisms with differing biological characteristics, suggesting distinct avenues for therapeutic intervention."
39927213,New rectum dose surface mapping methodology to identify rectal subregions associated with toxicities following prostate cancer radiotherapy.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Growing evidence suggests that spatial dose variations across the rectal surface influence toxicity risk after radiotherapy. Existing methodologies employ a fixed, arbitrary physical extent for rectal dose mapping, limiting their analysis. We developed a method to standardise rectum contours, unfold them into 2D cylindrical surface maps, and identify subregions where higher doses increase rectal toxicities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 1,048 patients with prostate cancer from the REQUITE study were used. Deep learning based automatic segmentations were generated to ensure consistency. Rectum length was standardised using linear transformations superior and inferior to the prostate. The automatic contours were validated against the manual contours through contour variation assessment with cylindrical mapping. Voxel-based analysis of the dose surface maps for the manual and automatic contours against individual rectal toxicities was performed using Student's t permutation test and Cox Proportional Hazards Model (CPHM). Significance was defined by permutation testing. RESULTS: Our method enabled the analysis of 1,048 patients using automatic segmentation. Student's t-test showed significance (p < 0.05) in the lower posterior for clinical-reported proctitis and patient-reported bowel urgency. Univariable CPHM identified a 3 % increased risk per Gy for clinician-reported proctitis and a 2 % increased risk per Gy for patient-reported bowel urgency in the lower posterior. No other endpoints were significant. CONCLUSION: We developed a methodology that unfolds the rectum to a 2D surface map. The lower posterior was significant for clinician-reported proctitis and patient-reported bowel urgency, suggesting that reducing the dose in the region could decrease toxicity risk."
39925739,Investigating the role of exosomal long non-coding RNAs in drug resistance within female reproductive system cancers.,"Exosomes, as key mediators of intercellular communication, have been increasingly recognized for their role in the oncogenic processes, particularly in facilitating drug resistance. This article delves into the emerging evidence linking exosomal lncRNAs to the modulation of drug resistance mechanisms in cancers such as ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer. It synthesizes current research findings on how these lncRNAs influence cancer cell survival, tumor microenvironment, and chemotherapy efficacy. Additionally, the review highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting exosomal lncRNAs, proposing a new frontier in overcoming drug resistance. By mapping the interface of exosomal lncRNAs and drug resistance, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding that could pave the way for innovative treatments and improved patient outcomes in female reproductive system cancers."
39924080,Lactoferrin-encapsulated dichloroacetophenone (DAP) nanoparticles enhance drug delivery and anti-tumor efficacy in prostate cancer.,"Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 1 (PDK1) regulates glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and is linked to prostate cancer metastasis and poor prognosis. The therapeutic application of 2,2-dichloroacetophenone (DAP), a PDK1 inhibitor, remains underexplored in prostate cancer. In this study we demonstrated that DAP exhibited a superior ability to inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and colony formation at a lower concentration (20 muM) compared to a previously established inhibitor, dichloroacetate (DCA), which required concentrations of 30 mM or higher. However, poor aqueous solubility and lower stability of DAP limits its therapeutic application. Nano formulation of DAP with natural lactoferrin enhanced its dispersion and stability by increasing polydispersity index and intensity, and reduced zeta potential values upon conjugation that overcame the solubility limitations of DAP. The lactoferrin-DAP nanoparticles exhibited enhanced therapeutic efficacy by precisely targeting prostate cancer cells that express high lactoferrin receptors and high anti-tumor activity in vitro (at 1 muM) and in mouse prostate tumor xenografts (20 mg/kg). Mechanistically, these nanoparticles induce apoptosis in cancer cells by inducing caspase3/7 activity and disrupting the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Moreover, lactoferrin-conjugated DAP nanoparticles suppressed the viability of docetaxel-resistant cells exhibiting a higher inhibitory efficacy compared to free DAP and DCA. Targeting PDK1 through lactoferrin-conjugated DAP nanoparticles represents a potent targeted therapeutic strategy for disrupting prostate tumor metabolism and offers promising implications for overcoming drug resistance."
39923999,De-regulation of aurora kinases by oncogenic HPV; implications in cancer development and treatment.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause diseases ranging from benign warts to invasive cancers. HPVs are the cause of almost all cervical cancers and a sub-set of other epithelial malignancies including head and neck cancers, specifically within the oropharynx. The oncogenic properties of HPV are largely mediated through the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which disrupt many cellular pathways to drive uncontrolled cell proliferation. One family of proteins targeted by HPV is the Aurora kinase family. Aurora kinases are serine/threonine kinases including Aurora kinase A (AURKA), B (AURKB), and C (AURKC) which are often dysregulated in many cancer types, including HPV driven cancers. All three family members play essential roles in mitotic regulation and accurate cell division. The deregulation of Aurora kinases by HPV infection highlights their potential as therapeutic targets in HPV-associated malignancies. Targeting Aurora kinase activity, in combination with current HPV therapies, may provide new avenues for treating HPV-induced cancers and reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases. Combinatorial inhibition targets distinct but overlapping functions of these kinases, thereby reducing the potential for cancer cells to develop resistance. This broad impact emphasizes the capability for Aurora kinase inhibitors not only as anti-mitotic agents but also as modulators of multiple oncogenic pathways. This review explores the combinatorial effects of Aurora kinase inhibition, offering insights into novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HPV-driven cancers."
39923922,Revolutionizing prostate cancer therapy: Artificial intelligence - Based nanocarriers for precision diagnosis and treatment.,"Prostate cancer is one of the major health challenges in the world and needs novel therapeutic approaches to overcome the limitations of conventional treatment. This review delineates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AL) in enhancing nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems for prostate cancer therapy. With its ability to optimize nanocarrier design and predict drug delivery kinetics, AI has revolutionized personalized treatment planning in oncology. We discuss how AI can be integrated with nanotechnology to address challenges related to tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and systemic toxicity. Emphasis is placed on strong AI-driven advancements in the design of nanocarriers, structural optimization, targeting of ligands, and pharmacokinetics. We also give an overview of how AI can better predict toxicity, reduce costs, and enable personalized medicine. While challenges persist in the way of data accessibility, regulatory hurdles, and interactions with the immune system, future directions based on explainable AI (XAI) models, integration of multimodal data, and green nanocarrier designs promise to move the field forward.

39923095,ANO7 expression in the prostate modulates mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is a significant health concern, ranking as the second most common cancer in males globally. Genetic factors contribute substantially to PrCa risk, with up to 57% of the risk being attributed to genetic determinants. A major challenge in managing PrCa is the early identification of aggressive cases for targeted treatment, while avoiding unnecessary interventions in slow-progressing cases. Therefore, there is a critical need for genetic biomarkers that can distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive PrCa cases. Previous research, including our own, has shown that germline variants in ANO7 are associated with aggressive PrCa. However, the function of ANO7 in the prostate remains unknown. METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on RWPE1 cells engineered to express ANO7 protein, alongside the analysis of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset and RNA-seq from prostate tissues. Differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted to identify key pathways. Additionally, we assessed oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolysis, and targeted metabolomics. Image analysis of mitochondrial morphology and lipidomics were also performed to provide further insight into the functional role of ANO7 in prostate cells. RESULTS: ANO7 expression resulted in the downregulation of metabolic pathways, particularly genes associated with the MYC pathway and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in both prostate tissue and ANO7-expressing cells. Measurements of OXPHOS and glycolysis in the ANO7-expressing cells revealed a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Targeted metabolomics showed reduced levels of the amino acid aspartate, indicating disrupted mitochondrial function in the ANO7-expressing cells. Image analysis demonstrated altered mitochondrial morphology in these cells. Additionally, ANO7 downregulated genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and induced changes in lipid composition of the cells, characterized by longer acyl chain lengths and increased unsaturation, suggesting a role for ANO7 in regulating lipid metabolism in the prostate. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the function of ANO7 in prostate cells, highlighting its involvement in metabolic pathways, particularly OXPHOS and lipid metabolism. The findings suggest that ANO7 may act as a key regulator of cellular lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in the prostate, shedding light on a previously unknown aspect of ANO7's biology."
39920561,Thioridazine Induces Increase in Expression of the Pyruvate Transporter MPC1 Associated with Immune Infiltration in Malignant Tumors.,"The MPC1 gene is involved in the transport of pyruvate into mitochondria, playing an important role in metabolic processes. Recently, it has been reported that higher MPC1 expression correlates with an increased number of immune cells in human cervical and lung cancers, indicating an enhanced antitumor immune response. Reduced MPC1 levels in gastric tumors are associated with a more severe disease course. Correlational analysis of the MPC1 gene in human lung, hippocampus and frontal cortex tissue samples based on data from the GTEx database revealed associations of this gene with schizophrenia, non-small cell lung cancer, and immune diseases. Our experiments showed that the mRNA level of the MPC1 gene in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 increases 5-fold under the influence of the schizophrenia neuroleptic thioridazine. The observed elevation of MPC1 level may cause tumor infiltration by immune cells, complementing the previously reported data indicating the ability of thioridazine to slow cell growth, induce apoptosis and reduce the ability of cells to migrate."
39920261,Causal associations between socioeconomic status and prostate cancer using two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common form of malignancy among men. The associations between socioeconomic status (SES) indicators and PCa risks remain incompletely elucidated. Through two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), this research seeks to assess the causal links between 4 genetically predicted SES indicators-average total household income before tax, the Townsend deprivation index at recruitment, unemployed status and college or university degree in the household-and PCa. Genetic variants were extracted from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) under stringent threshold as instrumental variables (IVs). We employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode and MR-Egger to estimate the causal effect, with sensitivity analyses such as Cochran's Q tests, MR-Egger, MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out performed to detect potential heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Our MR analysis revealed a causal association between unemployment and prostate cancer (OR: 3.07, 95%CI:1.12-8.42, P = 0.03). No causal associations were identified between other SES components and prostate cancer. The MR-PRESSO suggested 2 outliers in the association between college or university degree in household and prostate cancer, which rendered the association significant after outliers were removed. The heterogeneity and pleiotropy are unlikely to affect our causal estimate. Our results indicated that unemployment poses a potential risk factor for the incidence of PCa. The findings highlight the necessity for further exploration into the underlying etiology of PCa."
39916610,The inflammasome adaptor pycard is essential for immunity against Mycobacterium marinum infection in adult zebrafish.,"Inflammasomes regulate the host response to intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria. We have previously shown that the course of Mycobacterium marinum infection in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) mimics the course of tuberculosis in human. To investigate the role of the inflammasome adaptor pycard in zebrafish M. marinum infection, we produced two zebrafish knockout mutant lines for the pycard gene with CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. Although the zebrafish larvae lacking pycard developed normally and had unaltered resistance against M. marinum, the loss of pycard led to impaired survival and increased bacterial burden in the adult zebrafish. Based on histology, immune cell aggregates, granulomas, were larger in pycard-deficient fish than in wild-type controls. Transcriptome analysis with RNA sequencing of a zebrafish haematopoietic tissue, kidney, suggested a role for pycard in neutrophil-mediated defence, haematopoiesis and myelopoiesis during infection. Transcriptome analysis of fluorescently labelled, pycard-deficient kidney neutrophils identified genes that are associated with compromised resistance, supporting the importance of pycard for neutrophil-mediated immunity against M. marinum. Our results indicate that pycard is essential for resistance against mycobacteria in adult zebrafish."
39915876,Sideroflexin family genes were dysregulated and associated with tumor progression in prostate cancers.,"Sideroflexin (SFXN) family genes encode for a group of mitochondrial proteins involved in cellular processes such as iron homeostasis, amino acid metabolism, and energy production. Recent studies showed that they were aberrantly expressed in certain human cancers. However, there is a paucity of information about their expression in prostate cancer. In this study, we took a comprehensive approach to investigate their expression profiles in benign prostate tissue, prostate-derived cell lines, and prostate cancer tissues using multiple transcriptome datasets. Our results showed that SFXN1/3/4 genes were predominantly expressed in prostate tissue and cell lines. SFXN2/4 genes were significantly upregulated while the SFXN3 expression was significantly downregulated in malignant tissues compared to benign tissues. SFXN4 expression was identified as a diagnostic biomarker and prognostic factor for unfavorite survival outcomes. In advanced prostate cancers, SFXN2/4 expressions were positively correlated with the androgen receptor signaling activity but negatively correlated with the neuroendocrinal features. Further analysis discovered that SFXN5 expression was significantly elevated in neuroendocrinal prostate cancers. In conclusion, SFXN2/4 expressions are novel biomarkers in prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis."
39914385,Homologous recombination repair status in metastatic prostate cancer by next-generation sequencing and functional immunofluorescence.,"Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) is enriched for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations, which have prognostic and predictive value. Routine clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is still limited. We investigated the association between genomic and functional loss of HRR, using NGS and RAD51 immunofluorescence (RAD51-IF) in 219 primary or metastatic biopsies from 187 patients with stage IV prostate cancer. NGS showed frequent genomic alterations in TP53 (40%), AR (15%), PTEN (14%), FOXA1 (12%), MYC (10%), BRCA2 (9%), ATM (8%), and BRCA1 (2%). We pursued RAD51-IF in 206 samples; of those, 139/206 (67%) were evaluable. 21% of samples had RAD51-low score compatible with HRR deficiency (HRD). RAD51-IF showed high sensitivity (71%) and specificity (86%) for BRCA1/2 alterations. Patients with RAD51-low scores experienced longer progression-free survival (PFS) on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) or platinum chemotherapy. RAD51-IF is feasible in routine clinical samples from patients with mPC and is associated with clinically relevant HRR gene alterations."
39914081,Radiation-induced impacts on mitochondrial DNA and the transgenerational genomic instability.,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial genomes are dynamically evolving and are shaped by somatic mutation and selection throughout the female germline. In this study, we investigated the radiation-induced impacts on mitochondrial DNA in vitro and in vivo, as well as the transgenerational inheritance. METHODS: Human cervical cancer HeLa cells and telomerase-immortalized normal fibroblast BJ1-hTERT cells were exposed to X-rays at 0.5-8 Gy. Also, we exposed 8-week-old female C57BL/6N mice to a single whole-body dose of 2 Gy of X-rays and mated them with healthy males 1 day after irradiation. We extracted DNA from the irradiated cells, female mice, and the 2-week-old pups, then examined the mitochondrial DNA copy numbers (mtDNAcns) and radiation-induced damage by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The mtDNAcn levels in cells increased and the intact copy ratios decreased 24 h after irradiation, resulting in the delayed shift of heteroplasmy. Also, the peripheral blood-derived mtDNAcn levels in irradiated females increased 1 day after irradiation and the intact copy rates decreased, supporting the results in vitro. Furthermore, whole blood-derived mtDNAcn levels decreased in 2-week-old pups born from irradiated mothers, indicating the mitochondrial genomic instability. DISCUSSION: We found the delayed induction of mtDNA damage in human cancer and noncancerous cells after irradiation, as well as the same trend in mice. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is first to demonstrate the hereditary effects of radiation on the regulation of mitochondrial genome. These provide novel insights into the significance of radiation protection and preventive medicine for not only pre-pregnancy females but also the next generation."
39913513,Molecular epidemiology of human papillomavirus variants in cervical cancer in India.,"Background & objectives Cervical cancer (CC) has been documented as the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) have been suggested in the development of CC. Although prophylactic vaccines are available for the prevention of prevalent hr-HPV types, intra-type variations exist within a particular HPV type that has varying oncogenic potential as well as the mechanism of pathogenicity and varying neutralization by antibodies. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review to determine the distribution of HPV intra-typic variations in different geographical locations of India and their reported implications. Methods Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to retrieve relevant articles from the standard databases using appropriate keywords. Consequently, 17 articles were included in the current review after screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results The majority of articles included in this review reported variations within the HPV16 E6 gene, followed by the L1 and E7 genes. Analysis of available data indicated the differential regional distribution of some variations. These variations have also been reported to impact the biological functions of various viral proteins. Interpretation & conclusions The distribution of lineages varied with the different genomic regions sequenced. Additionally, there were certain unique and common variations in the HPV genome with respect to geographical regions. Hence, we suggest the identification of region-specific variations for the development of diagnostic and prognostic interventions."
39912912,High-purity CTC RNA sequencing identifies prostate cancer lineage phenotypes prognostic for clinical outcomes.,"The development of treatment resistance remains universal for patients with metastatic prostate cancer, driven by AR alterations and lineage state transitions. Identifying the evolution of lineage transitions in treatment resistance has been limited by the challenges of collecting serial tissue biopsies on treatment, which can be overcome using blood-based liquid biopsies. Utilizing a novel circulating tumor cell (CTC) isolation approach, we collected 273 CTC samples from 117 patients with metastatic prostate cancer for RNA sequencing. 146 samples from 70 patients had tumor purity comparable to tissue biopsies. We identified four CTC transcriptional phenotypes, mirroring lineage states identified in tissue. Patients with a luminal-B-like CTC phenotype defined by persistent AR signaling and high proliferation, as well as those with a neuroendocrine CTC phenotype, had significantly shorter survival than patients with luminal-A-like and low proliferation phenotypes. In a prospective substudy, pre-treatment CTC luminal-B-like phenotype was associated with early progression on 177Lu-PSMA-617."
39911580,"Immune regulatory genes impact the hot/cold tumor microenvironment, affecting cancer treatment and patient outcomes.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immunologically hot tumors, characterized by an inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME), contrast significantly with immunologically cold tumors. The identification of these tumor immune subtypes holds clinical significance, as hot tumors may exhibit improved prognoses and heightened responsiveness to checkpoint blockade therapy. Nevertheless, as yet there is no consensus regarding the clinically relevant definition of hot/cold tumors, and the influence of immune genes on the formation of hot/cold tumors remains poorly understood. METHODS: Data for 33 different types of cancer were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and their immune composition was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Tumors were categorized as either hot or cold based on their distinct immune composition, ongoing immune response, and overall survival. A customized immunogram was created to identify important immunological characteristics. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Hallmark pathway enrichment were evaluated through gene set variation analysis. Additionally, hub genes that regulate the tumor microenvironment were identified, and their expression patterns were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing. Furthermore, drug sensitivity and molecular docking analyses were performed to identify potential drug candidates capable of transforming cold tumors into hot tumors. For validation, a clinical cohort of patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma was examined using multiplex immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We were able to differentiate between hot and cold tumors in various types of cancer (bladder urothelial carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma) by analyzing the presence of CD8+ T cells, activated natural killer cells, and M2-type macrophages, as well as the cytolytic activity and T cell proliferation. Hub genes that regulate the TME, including PDCD1, CD276, and NT5E, were discovered. The increased expression of NT5E and its prognostic significance were confirmed through multiplex immunohistochemistry in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Finally, dasatinib and tozasertib were identified as drug candidates capable of converting cold pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors into hot tumors. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed a framework for discerning clinically significant immune subtypes across various cancer types, further identifying several potential targets for converting cold tumors into hot tumors to enhance anticancer treatment efficacy."

39910262,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tumor heterogeneity in small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma.,"Small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma (SCNECC) is an aggressive gynecological malignancy with poor prognosis. The precision therapeutic strategies for SCNECC are severely limited by the complex tumor microenvironment. Here, we mapped the single-cell landscape of a total of six samples from matched SCNECC cancerous foci and normal adjacent cervical tissues. Through analysis of 68,455 high-quality cells, malignant epithelial cells were identified with increased neuroendocrine differentiation and reduced keratinization. Within four epithelial cell clusters, the key transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 defined molecular subtypes. Transitional trajectory among subtypes characterized two distinct carcinogenesis pathways in SCNECC. The P-type SCNECC showed potentially enhanced immune infiltration over other subtypes. Intercellular communication analysis identified several immune checkpoints and differentially expressed signaling pathways among subtypes. Through western blotting, the TC-YIK cell line was identified as an N-type SCNECC cell with high expression of SLFN11 and mTOR. Based on immunohistochemical staining of malignant subtyping markers, a cohort of 66 SCNECC patients from our hospital were divided into five subtypes. We further combined YAP1 expression with other clinicopathological factors (Cox p < 0.05) to establish a prognostic nomogram. Overall, these findings provide clues for tumorigenesis, precision treatments and prognostic prediction in SCNECC."
39910021,Adult head circumference and the risk of cancer: a retrospective cohort study.,"PURPOSE: Cancer-related genes and pathways have recently been implicated in a genome-wide meta-analysis of head size. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the association between adult head circumference and the risk of cancer. METHODS: This is a cohort study using data from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study, where 1,301 participants aged 27-96 years with head circumference measured between 2015 and 2019, and without a history of cancer, were followed up to 15 January 2024. Incident cancers were identified using electronic medical records from a territory-wide database. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, height, weight, education, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and family history of cancer, as well as accounting for familial clustering. RESULTS: The median head circumference was 53 cm (interquartile range [IQR]: 51-54) and 54 cm (IQR: 53-55) for women and men, respectively. During a median follow-up of 6.9 years, 66 individuals were diagnosed with cancer. In the adjusted model, a larger head circumference was associated with an increased risk of any cancer (HR per cm increase: 1.17; 95% CI 1.00-1.36). Results remained similar when adjusting for waist-to-hip ratio instead of weight or when additionally adjusting for serum calcium and phosphorus levels. When stratified by cancer sites, head circumference was most strongly associated with colorectal cancer (HR per cm increase: 1.81; 95% CI 1.14-2.90) and prostate cancer (HR per cm increase: 1.58; 95% CI 1.16-2.16). CONCLUSION: Head circumference is positively associated with the risk of cancer independently of height, weight, and other cancer risk factors."
39908142,Phosphorylation of SIRT7 by ATM causes DNA mismatch repair downregulation and adaptive mutability during chemotherapy.,"Drug resistance significantly limits the efficacy of chemotherapy. The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system maintains genomic stability by correcting DNA errors. During DNA-damaging treatments, cancer cells transiently increase their adaptive mutability, also known as microsatellite instability (MSI), to evade therapeutic pressure through MMR downregulation, conferring drug resistance. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of MMR protein downregulation under DNA-damaging drugs remains limited. Our study reveals a negative correlation between SIRT7 protein levels and MMR core protein MSH2 levels in cervical and lung cancer tissues. SIRT7 destabilizes MSH2, promoting MSI and mutagenesis. Molecularly, DNA damage triggers ATM kinase-dependent phosphorylation and subcellular redistribution of SIRT7. Phosphorylated SIRT7 interacts with and deacetylates MSH2, impairing MMR, and inducing MSI and drug resistance. Our findings suggest that SIRT7 drives MMR downregulation under therapeutic stress and that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of SIRT7 may serve as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapeutic efficacy and a target for cancer treatment."
39906184,Exploring the molecular interface of gene expression dynamics and prostate cancer susceptibility in response to HBCD exposure.,"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), a brominated flame retardant, is linked to various health implications, including prostate cancer. This study explored the molecular mechanisms and potential biomarkers associated with HBCD exposure using data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 7,147 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 46 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, with significant enrichment in cancer-related pathways and xenobiotic metabolism. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analyses revealed four hub genes: DNAJC12, PKMYT1, RRM2, and SLC12A5. These genes displayed notable expression changes in response to HBCD exposure and were strongly correlated with survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients, as demonstrated by Cox regression and ROC curve analyses. Additionally, miRNA correlation analyses indicated robust positive associations, highlighting a coordinated regulatory network. Experimental expression analyses on HBCD-treated cell lines further validated these findings. This study sheds light on the significant impact of HBCD on gene and miRNA expression in prostate cancer, emphasizing the potential of the identified hub genes and miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By elucidating the pathways and regulatory networks influenced by HBCD, the findings provide a foundation for developing strategies to mitigate its carcinogenic effects and improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients."
39905466,Improving drug repositioning with negative data labeling using large language models.,"INTRODUCTION: Drug repositioning offers numerous advantages, such as faster development timelines, reduced costs, and lower failure rates in drug development. Supervised machine learning is commonly used to score drug candidates but is hindered by the lack of reliable negative data-drugs that fail due to inefficacy or toxicity- which is difficult to access, lowering their prediction accuracy and generalization. Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning has been used to overcome this issue by either randomly sampling unlabeled drugs or identifying probable negatives but still suffers from misclassification or oversimplified decision boundaries. RESULTS: We proposed a novel strategy using Large Language Models (GPT-4) to analyze all clinical trials on prostate cancer and systematically identify true negatives. This approach showed remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy on independent test sets with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.76 (+/- 0.33) compared to 0.55 (+/- 0.15) and 0.48 (+/- 0.18) for two commonly used PU learning approaches. Using our labeling strategy, we created a training set of 26 positive and 54 experimentally validated negative drugs. We then applied a machine learning ensemble to this new dataset to assess the repurposing potential of the remaining 11,043 drugs in the DrugBank database. This analysis identified 980 potential candidates for prostate cancer. A detailed review of the top 30 revealed 9 promising drugs targeting various mechanisms such as genomic instability, p53 regulation, or TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. CONCLUSION: By expanding our negative data labeling approach to all diseases within the ClinicalTrials.gov database, our method could greatly advance supervised drug repositioning, offering a more accurate and data-driven path for discovering new treatments."
39905145,Elevated POSTN expression predicts poor prognosis and is associated with radioresistance in cervical cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a significant global health issue and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in women. Radiotherapy is a crucial treatment modality for CC; however, tumor heterogeneity and resistance to radiotherapy often result in suboptimal outcomes for some patients, including recurrence and metastasis. Periostin (POSTN), a matricellular protein within the tumor microenvironment, has been implicated in the promotion of tumor progression and treatment resistance, particularly through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Despite this, the role of POSTN in radiotherapy resistance in CC patients remains underexplored. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of POSTN expression in CC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy and explored potential mechanisms underlying radiotherapy resistance. We analyzed data from 92 CC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 153 patients from our institution, assessing POSTN expression levels through mRNA analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Our findings revealed that high POSTN expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stages, poorer radiotherapy outcomes, and worse overall survival (OS). Additionally, multivariate Cox regression analysis identified POSTN as an independent prognostic factor for CC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy. A prognostic nomogram integrating POSTN expression and clinicopathological features demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for OS. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that high POSTN expression may be linked to resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified EMT as a top enriched pathway in patients with high POSTN expression, suggesting it may play a critical role in radiotherapy resistance. Subsequently, in vitro experiments confirmed that POSTN knockdown significantly inhibited HeLa cell proliferation, invasion, and enhanced radiosensitivity, while promoting apoptosis. These findings indicate that high POSTN expression is a risk factor for poor prognosis in CC patients undergoing radical radiotherapy, and targeting POSTN may improve radiotherapy efficacy by reducing tumor proliferation and resistance."
39903954,"Neuroendocrine cervical carcinomas: genomic insights, controversies in treatment strategies, and future directions: a NeCTuR study.","Neuroendocrine cervical carcinomas are rare, aggressive tumors with a high risk of early metastasis and poor survival outcomes. Despite existing therapies, over half of patients experience recurrence or progression after primary treatment, and survival after recurrence remains limited. Survival rates have not significantly improved over the past several decades, underscoring an urgent need for better therapeutic options. The rarity of neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma has precluded randomized trials, leaving treatment strategies to be guided by small retrospective studies or adapted from protocols for small cell lung cancer. However, as we gain a deeper understanding of its unique origin, genomic landscape, and biological characteristics, it has become clear that neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma requires distinct management strategies. Key questions in managing neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma remain unanswered: does adjuvant radiation therapy improve outcomes for early-stage disease? Should neoadjuvant chemotherapy be considered for patients with bulky, localized tumors? Can immunotherapy improve outcomes when added to chemoradiation in locally advanced cases? Should immunotherapy be a standard option for recurrent disease? Addressing these questions requires a thorough understanding of the unique molecular and biological characteristics of neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma and its clinical behavior. This review aims to provide an updated summary of the molecular landscape of neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma, highlighting features that distinguish it from small cell lung cancer and align with other types of cervical cancer. We discuss current treatment approaches, identify gaps in knowledge, and examine paradigm-shifting clinical trials that have significantly impacted survival outcomes in cervical cancer and small cell lung cancer, translating these insights into potential strategies for neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma. By focusing on the unique aspects of neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma, this review emphasizes the need for specialized treatment strategies for this challenging disease."
39903771,Radiotherapy-Associated Cellular Senescence and EMT Alterations Contribute to Distinct Disease Relapse Patterns in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.,"A notable number of locally advanced cervical carcinoma (LACC) patients experience local or distant disease relapse following radiotherapy. The contribution of tumor microenvironment (TME) to tumor recurrence at different sites remains unclear. Here, single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from 28 pre- and on-treatment LACC samples from patients with different disease relapse patterns is analyzed. The findings revealed opposing alterations in the expression levels of the cellular senescence pathway after radiotherapy in patients with local and distant relapses. In contrast, an increase in the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition module after radiotherapy in both relapse groups is observed. Cell-cell interactions, drug-target expression analyses in malignant cells after radiation, and multiplex immunofluorescence of tumor tissue identified interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) as a potential therapeutic target. It is demonstrated that combining the IL1R1 inhibitor anakinra with radiation can mitigate the effects of radiation on tumor cells. This study highlights the distinct roles of cellular senescence and EMT in tumor recurrence."
39903534,Characterization of the vaginal microbiome of postmenopausal patients receiving chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer.,"The standard-of-care treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer includes pelvic radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy and is associated with a 30%-50% failure rate. New prognostic and therapeutic targets are needed to improve clinical outcomes. The vaginal microbiome has been linked to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, but little is known about the vaginal microbiome in locally advanced cervical cancer as it relates to chemoradiation. In this pilot study, we utilized 16S rRNA gene community profiling to characterize the vaginal microbiomes of 26 postmenopausal women with locally advanced cervical cancer receiving chemoradiation. Our analysis revealed diverse anaerobe-dominated communities whose taxonomic composition, diversity, or bacterial abundance did not change with treatment. We hypothesized that characteristics of the microbiome might correlate with treatment response. Pretreatment microbial diversity and bacterial abundance were not associated with disease recurrence. We observed a greater relative abundance of Fusobacterium in patients who later had cancer recurrence, suggesting that Fusobacterium could play a role in modifying treatment response. Taken together, this hypothesis-generating pilot study provides insight into the composition and dynamics of the vaginal microbiome, offering proof of concept for the future study of the microbiome and its relationship with treatment outcomes in locally advanced cervical cancer."
39902633,Detection and Quantification of Polymorphic MICA and MICB Molecules in Immunoassays: Initial Insights.,"The MICA and MICB molecules, expressed on the cell membrane in response to cellular stress or cancer transformation, pose significant challenges for immunoassays. They exhibit high sequence and structural similarity, alongside considerable allelic polymorphism, with 291 and 53 known protein sequences, respectively. Some researchers treat MICA and MICB as a unified target because of their structural and functional similarities, while others distinguish between them. However, which approach is superior and under what circumstances remains unknown. Moreover, information about assays' reactivity with MICA and MICB allelic variants is often missing. In this study, we developed 10 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and two sandwich ELISAs for the detection and quantification of these molecules. We assembled a panel of recombinant proteins representing the diversity of MICA and MICB in the European population and profiled the reactivities of the mAbs and ELISAs. The performance of these sandwich ELISAs was evaluated using samples from prostate cancer patients and pregnant women experiencing premature rupture of membranes. Our study assessed the impact of MICA and MICB polymorphism on their detection and quantification by immunological methods, providing evidence to support differential or non-differential approaches for their detection."
39902297,Therapeutic target genes and regulatory networks of gallic acid in cervical cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to identify the therapeutic targets and regulatory mechanisms of the antitumor drug gallic acid (GA) in cervical cancer (CC). METHODS: HeLa cells were treated with GA and subjected to RNA-sequencing using the DNBSEQ platform. By combining the results of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis and RNA-seq, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including those upregulated and downregulated genes in CC compared with the normal cervix in the GEO and TCGA database, while expressed reversed after treatment with GA, were identified. Subsequently, the function enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction of the DEGs were conducted. The candidate genes were identified using the Cytoscape software Gentiscape2.2 and MCODE plug-ins. Furthermore, the upstream microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) of the candidate genes were predicted using the online tools of MirDIP, TarBase, and ENCORI. Finally, the regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. RESULTS: CC cells are significantly inhibited by GA. Combining the GEO and TCGA databases and RNA-seq analyses, 127 DEGs were obtained and subjected to functional enrichment analysis. This analysis revealed that 221 biological processes, 82 cellular components, 63 molecular functions, and 36 KEGG pathways were employed to identify three therapeutic candidate genes, including CDC20, DLGAP5, and KIF20A. The upstream 13 miRNAs, 4 lncRNA, and 42 circRNAs were detected and used to construct a lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA-pathway regulatory network. CONCLUSION: This study identified candidate genes and the regulatory networks underlying the therapeutic effects of GA on CC using GA data mining methods, thus establishing a theoretical basis for targeted therapy of CC."
39901166,SELP(+) TEC:CD8(+) T cell crosstalk associates with improved radiotherapy efficacy in cervical cancer.,"P-selectin (SELP) expression in tumor cells has been implicated in promoting tumor progression and treatment resistance across various cancers. However, our prior study identified SELP expression in a specific subpopulation of endothelial cells within cervical cancer (CC) and potentially linked to anti-cancer immune response. The precise mechanisms by which SELP influences anti-cancer immunity and its involvement in radiotherapy response in CC, however, remain elusive. To address these gaps, this study analyzed tumor tissue samples from 205 CC patients undergoing radiotherapy, scRNA-seq data from 42,159 cells of eight patients, and bulk RNA-sequencing data from 187 radiotherapy-treated patients. The results revealed that elevated SELP expression in tumor endothelial cells (TECs) was significantly correlated with improved survival outcomes in patients treated with radiotherapy. The SELP(high) group exhibited a prominent enrichment of immune-related pathways, coupled with a diminished enrichment in epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis pathways. Notably, this group demonstrated increased infiltration of CD8(+) T cells and enhanced expression of chemokine receptors, including ACKR1. Furthermore, our data suggest that SELP(+) TECs engage in crosstalk with CD8(+) T cells via the ACKR1-CCL5 axis, which is associated with improved radiotherapy efficacy. In conclusion, these findings underscore the pivotal role of SELP(+) TEC:CD8(+) T cell interactions through the ACKR1-CCL5 pathway in enhancing radiotherapy response in CC. Targeting this crosstalk may offer novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate treatment resistance and improve patient survival."

39900986,"Elevated serum levels of GPX4, NDUFS4, PRDX5, and TXNRD2 as predictive biomarkers for castration resistance in prostate cancer patients: an exploratory study.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease affecting over 14% of the male population worldwide. Although patients often respond positively to initial treatments within the first 2-3 years, many eventually develop a more lethal form of the disease known as castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). At present, no biomarkers that predict the onset of CRPC are available. This study aims to provide insights into the diagnosis and prediction of CRPC emergence. METHODS: Protein expression dynamics were analysed in drug (androgen receptor inhibitor)-tolerant persister (DTP) and drug withdrawal cells using proteomics to identify potential biomarkers. These biomarkers were subsequently validated using a mouse model, 180-paired carcinoma/benign tissues, and 482 serum samples. Five machine learning algorithms were employed to build clinical prediction models, wherein the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) framework was used to interpret the best-performing model. Moreover, three regression models were developed to determine the Time from initial PCa diagnosis to CRPC development (TPC) in patients. RESULTS: We identified that the protein expression levels of GPX4, NDUFS4, PRDX5, and TXNRD2 were significantly upregulated in PCa patients, particularly in those with CRPC. Among the tested machine learning models, the random forest and extreme gradient boosting models performed best on tissue and serum cohorts, achieving AUCs of 0.958 and 0.988, respectively. In addition, a significant inverse correlation was observed between TPC and serum levels of these four biomarkers. This correlation was formulated in three regression models, which achieved the smallest mean absolute error of 1.903 on independent datasets for predicting CRPC emergence. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into the role of DTP cells in CRPC development. The quad protein panel identified in our study, along with the post hoc and intrinsically explainable prediction models, may serve as a convenient and real-time prognostic tool, addressing the current lack of clinical biomarkers for CRPC."
39895895,Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia diagnosed during surveillance for Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome: A case report.,"BACKGROUND: Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH) is a benign cervical condition that has been proposed as a precursor lesion to minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA), a rare but highly aggressive subtype of well-differentiated gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (GAS). MDA is more frequently observed in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) and is strongly associated with mutations in the STK11 gene. While LEGH is not inherently linked to PJS, its potential progression to MDA warrants vigilance, particularly in patients with PJS due to their heightened risk of gynecologic malignancies. Here, we report a case of LEGH diagnosed during surveillance for PJS, analyzed via whole genome sequencing. LEGH is a benign cervical condition, considered a precursor lesion to minimal deviation adenocarcinoma, often observed in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) and potentially linked to mutations in the STK11 gene. CASE: A 23-year-old woman, diagnosed with PJS at age 11, was referred to a gynecologist after a cystic lesion was detected in the cervix during a follow-up computed tomography scan. Initial examinations, including imaging and colposcopy, did not indicate LEGH or a malignant tumor. Imaging alone is insufficient to exclude premalignant or malignant conditions, as abnormal cervical lesions often require biopsy for a definitive diagnosis. However, cervical cytology showed nuclear atypia was minimal, but some clusters exhibited disordered alignment, and the cytoplasm contained yellowish mucus suggestive of LEGH. Based on these findings, cytology follow-up was planned. However, the patient did not return for further follow-up. After one year and five months, the patient presented with increased mucous vaginal discharge. Cervical cytology indicated atypical glandular cells, and magnetic resonance imaging with contrast enhancement revealed an enlarged cervical lesion, suggesting minimal deviation adenocarcinoma. We performed cervical conization, and a histopathological examination helped confirm LEGH. High-throughput next-generation sequencing of the excised cervical tissue revealed a missense mutation in the serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) gene on chromosome 19 (c.1062C > G) and three missense mutations in STK11 interacting protein (STK11IP) on chromosome 2 (c.2G > T, c.1687G > A, c.2255C > T). Mutations in STK11, particularly those affecting its regulatory domains, may significantly increase cancer risk in patients with PJS, and that STK11IP plays a crucial role in modulating STK11 activity. The patient, seeking to preserve fertility, has been monitored for five years post-surgery without evidence of malignant transformation. Continuous monitoring with periodic imaging and cytological assessments has shown no evidence of malignant transformation. The absence of elevated tumor markers further supports the conservative approach. While there are no tumor markers specific to cervical cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were measured as part of the screening process in this case. CONCLUSION: We conclude that whole genome sequencing in patients with PJS and LEGH could be pivotal in predicting cervical malignancy. This case emphasizes the utility of whole genome sequencing in predicting the risk of cervical malignancy in patients with PJS and LEGH and highlighting the critical role of genetic factors in the management and surveillance of these patients. Continuous monitoring post-surgery showed no evidence of malignant transformation, supporting a conservative approach in fertility-preserving treatment scenarios."
39895102,Alpha-linolenic acid-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of cervical cancer cell lines.,"Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer globally and the second most prevalent cancer among women in India, is primarily caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). The association of diet with cancer etiology and prevention has been well established and nutrition has been shown to regulate cancer through modulation of epigenetic markers. Dietary fatty acids, especially omega-3, reduce the risk of cancer by preventing or reversing the progression through a variety of cellular targets, including epigenetic regulation. In this work, we have evaluated the potential of ALA (alpha linolenic acid), an omega-3 fatty acid, to regulate cervical cancer through epigenetic mechanisms. The effect of ALA was evaluated on the regulation of histone deacetylases1, DNA methyltransferases 1, and 3b, and global DNA methylation by ELISA. RT-PCR was utilized to assess the expression of tumor regulatory genes (hTERT, DAPK, RARbeta, and CDH1) and their promoter methylation in HeLa (HPV18-positive), SiHa (HPV16-positive) and C33a (HPV-negative) cervical cancer cell lines. ALA increased DNA demethylase, HMTs, and HATs while decreasing global DNA methylation, DNMT, HDMs, and HDACs mRNA expression/activity in all cervical cancer cell lines. ALA downregulated hTERT oncogene while upregulating the mRNA expression of TSGs (Tumor Suppressor Genes) CDH1, RARbeta, and DAPK in all the cell lines. ALA reduced methylation in the 5' CpG island of CDH1, RARbeta, and DAPK1 promoters and reduced global DNA methylation in cervical cancer cell lines. These results suggest that ALA regulates the growth of cervical cancer cells by targeting epigenetic markers, shedding light on its potential therapeutic role in cervical cancer management."
39894193,CRISPR integrated biosensors: A new paradigm for cancer detection.,"Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally, necessitating need for advancements of technologies for early therapeutics. Conventional detection methodologies often lag behind in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness, leading to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment. The need of advanced diagnostic techniques has considerably increased and led to the development of biosensors. Biosensing technologies offer several advantages over conventional methods hence, overcome limitations and improve diagnostic accuracy. Biosensors, particularly CRISPR-Cas based biosensors have emerged as a revolutionary technology for oncology diagnostics due to their high precision and adaptability. CRISPR-based biosensors provide remarkable precision, sensitivity, multiplexing capabilities, specificity, and rapidness for developing a cost-effective and portable point of care diagnostic device for cancer detection. In this review, we have discussed cancer pathogenicity, assessed the traditional detection techniques, and explored the advancements and advantages of biosensors, particularly CRISPR-based biosensors, in the detection of some major cancer types, namely lung, liver, colorectal, prostate, and cervical cancers. CRISPR-based biosensors represent a significant potential in cancer diagnostics, offering precise, cost-effective, and rapid detection of cancer biomarkers. The integration of CRISPR technology with biosensors holds substantial promise for enhancing early detection and improving patient outcomes in cancer diagnostics."
39893332,Analysing DNA methylation and transcriptomic signatures to predict prostate cancer recurrence risk.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant global health challenge, with approximately 1.6 million new cases and 366,000 deaths annually. Despite high survival rates for localized prostate cancer, recurrence poses a substantial risk due to inherent biological factors and residual disease. Early detection and intervention are essential for enhancing patient outcomes and reducing mortality. However, traditional diagnostics such as PSA tests, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies often lack specificity resulting in overdiagnosis. There is a pressing need for novel biomarkers to enhance precision medicine approaches for PCa. This study employs a machine learning approach to identify DNA methylation and RNA expression biomarkers predictive of PCa recurrence using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We analyzed 49,133 genes, identifying 684 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and 691 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between recurrence and non-recurrence groups. Ten genes (TNNI2, SPIN2, COL5A3, RNF169, CCND1, FGFR1, SLC17A2, FAMM71F2, RREB1, AOX1) were found to have significant correlations between methylation and expression, forming the basis for our predictive model. A support vector machine (SVM) model was developed using these ten genes, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.773, demonstrating robust predictive capability. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed the SVM score as an independent predictor of recurrence (HR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.28-0.69, P < 0.001). The analysis of recurrence-free survival suggested that patients with low-risk scores experienced significantly better outcomes compared to those with high-risk scores. Functional enrichment analyses of DMGs revealed significant involvement in biological processes such as transcription regulation, signal transduction, and immune response, highlighting the potential mechanistic pathways of these biomarkers. Validation using real-time PCR confirmed differential expression and methylation patterns of the identified genes in prostate cancer (PC3) and non-cancerous cell lines (PNT2). In conclusion, our study hihglights the DNA methylation biomarkers linked to PCa recurrence and introduces a promising SVM model for early prediction, potentially improving treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the biological roles of these genes in PCa aiming to refine therapeutic approaches."
39893002,Metformin in overcoming enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation is the standard treatment for patients with prostate cancer. However, the disease eventually progresses as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, is a typical drug for treating CRPC and with continuous reliance on the drug, can lead to enzalutamide resistance. This highlights the necessity for developing novel therapeutic targets to combat the gain of resistance. Metformin has been recently investigated for its potential antitumorigenic effects in many cancer types. In this study, we used enzalutamide and metformin in combination to explore the possible rescued efficacy of enzalutamide in the treatment of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. We first tested the effects of this combination treatment on cell viability, drug synergy, and cell proliferation in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cell lines. After combination treatment, we observed a decrease in cell proliferation and viability as well as a synergistic effect of both enzalutamide and metformin in vitro. Following these results, we sought to explore how combination treatment affected mitochondrial fitness using mitochondrial stress test analysis and mitochondrial membrane potential shifts due to metformin's action in inhibiting complex I of oxidative phosphorylation. We employed 2 different strategies for in vivo testing using 22Rv1 and LuCaP35CR xenograft models. Finally, RNA sequencing revealed a potential link in the downregulation of rat sarcoma-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling following combination treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative phosphorylation might play a critical role in the development of resistance to cancer therapy. This study showed that targeting oxidative phosphorylation with metformin can enhance the efficacy of enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro."
39891432,Genome-Wide Association Analyses of HPV16 and HPV18 Seropositivity Identify Susceptibility Loci for Cervical Cancer.,"Infection by high-risk human papillomavirus is known to exacerbate cervical cancer development. The host immune response is crucial in disease regression. Large-scale genetic association studies for cervical cancer have identified few susceptibility variants, mainly at the human leukocyte antigen locus on chromosome 6. We hypothesized that the host immune response modifies cervical cancer risk and performed three genome-wide association analyses for HPV16, HPV18 and HPV16/18 seropositivity in 7814, 7924, and 7924 samples from the UK Biobank, followed by validation genotyping in the German Cervigen case-control series of cervical cancer and dysplasia. In GWAS analyses, we identified two loci associated with HPV16 seropositivity (6p21.32 and 15q26.2), two loci associated with HPV18 seropositivity (5q31.2 and 14q24.3), and one locus for HPV16 and/or HPV18 seropositivity (at 6p21.32). MAGMA gene-based analysis identified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 as genome-wide significant (GWS) genes. In validation genotyping, the genome-wide significant lead variant at 6p21.32, rs9272293 associated with overall cervical disease (OR = 0.86, p = 0.004, 95% CI = 0.78-0.95, n = 3710) and HPV16 positive invasive cancer (OR = 0.73, p = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.59-0.91, n = 1431). This variant was found to be a robust eQTL for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1-AS1, C4B, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DRB6, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DPB1 in a series of cervical epithelial tissue samples. We additionally genotyped twenty-four HPV seropositivity variants below the GWS threshold out of which eleven variants were found to be associated with cervical disease in our cohort, suggesting that further seropositivity variants may determine cervical disease outcome. Our study identifies novel genomic risk loci that associate with HPV type-specific cervical cancer and dysplasia risk and provides evidence for candidate genes at one of the risk loci."
39890303,"Tissue-Based Biomarkers Important for Prognostication and Management of Genitourinary Tumors, Including Surrogate Markers of Genomic Alterations.","A better understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie urologic malignancies and advances in targeted therapies has impacted classification, prognostication, and treatment. In bladder tumors, these advances include the development of antibody-drug conjugates targeting nectin-4 and Trop-2, as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and immunotherapy. In prostate cancer, assessment of the percentage of Gleason pattern 4, presence of cribriform glands, and molecular alterations, including PTEN and mismatch repair protein loss, have become standard for clinical care. In renal malignancies, alterations in TSC1/2, mammalian target of rapamycin, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and other genes impact classification and therapeutic decisions."
39889174,Effect of weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Cancer incidence and development are strongly correlated with obesity, however there is insufficient data to support a causal relationship between intentional weight loss and the prevention or promotion of cancer. We investigated the causal relationship between weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and the incidence of 18 cancers using Mendelian randomization (MR). A genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data related to weight loss following RYGB from the GWAS catalog database were used as exposure, and GWAS data related to 18 cancers from the Medical Research Council integrative epidemiology unit open GWAS project were used as outcomes. In order to investigate the causal relationship between exposure and results, we used a two-sample MR approach. The primary analysis technique was inverse variance weighting, with weighted median, and MR-Egger regression utilized as supplemental techniques to confirm the findings. Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were investigated using a variety of sensitivity studies, including the Cochran Q test, MR-Egger regression pleiotropy test, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier, and leave-one-out analysis. We included a total of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables through rigorous quality control screening. Under the limitations of Bonferroni correction threshold (P < 2.78 x 10-3), our results suggest that the weight loss following RYGB has a significant causal relationship with a reduced risk of breast (odds ratio [OR]: 0.784; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.762-0.808; P = 2.167e-58) and lung cancer (OR: 0.992; 95% CI: 0.987-0.997; P = .0023), and a potential causal relationship with a decreased risk of hematological cancer (OR: 0.9998462; 95% CI: 0.9997088-0.9999836; P = .028) and an increased risk of cervical cancer (OR: 1.000123; 95% CI: 1.0000313-1.000215; P = .009). Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our analysis results. Genetically predicted weight loss following RYGB has significant causal effects in reducing the risk of breast and lung cancer. It also has potential benefits in lowering the risk of hemotological cancers and increasing the risk of cervical cancer. Considering the limitations of our study, the reliability of its results and the underlying mechanisms require further investigation."
39887785,Immunohistochemical Analysis of Androgen Receptor Expression Predicts the Prognosis of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Abiraterone Acetate.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of abiraterone acetate varies among patients with high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Both androgen receptor (AR) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18) are markers of the luminal lineage of prostate cancer, and their expression levels have been suggested to affect the response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This study aimed to predict the efficacy of abiraterone acetate in high-risk mCSPC via immunohistochemical staining of biopsy specimens obtained at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients treated with abiraterone acetate in combination with ADT. AR and CK18 expression in prostate biopsy specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: AR and CK18 staining was not significantly associated with overall survival (OS). However, low AR staining was significantly associated with a shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC) compared with high AR staining (log-rank test, p = 0.018). Similarly, low CK18 staining was significantly associated with a shorter TTCRPC compared with high CK18 staining (log-rank test, p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical analysis of AR or CK18 expression in biopsy specimens may serve as a predictive biomarker of high-risk mCSPC treated with abiraterone acetate. TRIAL REGISTRATION: None."
39887605,The role and mechanism of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta in the occurrence and development of different human tumors: A pan-cancer analysis.,"Carcinomatosis is one of the leading threats to human public fitness. HNF1B is a critical transcription element in vertebrate proliferation and oncogenesis, which has been shown to play roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Our previous results have identified HNF1B as a tumor suppressor that could inhibit the malignant progression of prostate cancer. Yet there is no pan-carcinomatosis analysis of HNF1B, which could help us better understand common and unique underlying mechanisms in mankind knubs to enhance novel and competent treatment. Here, in our research, we evaluated the utterance pattern and explored the function of HNF1B in 33 knub categories using the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and CLNICAL PROTEOMICTUMOR ANALYSIS CONSORTIUM (CPTAC) dataset. We found different HNF1B roles in various cancer types. HNF1B was upregulated in CHOL, STAD, KIRP, and THCA, and was downregulated in GBM, KICH, COAD, KIRC, LUSC, SARC, PAAD, and TGCT. Prognostic analyses indicated that higher HNF1B displayed better illness outcomes in BLCA, READ, and PRAD, while poorer outcomes in LUSC and THYM. HNF1B mutation was most frequent in endometrial cancer but was not associated with disease prognosis. It was discovered that HNF1B utterance relevant to endothelial cell penetration status in BLCA, ESCA, LUAD, LUSC, and TGCT, and carcinomatosis-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in ESCA, KIRC, LIHC, and TGCT. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis disclosed that metabolism-related functions were implicated in the function of HNF1B. Taken together, our pan- carcinomatosis analysis showed the complicated roles of HNF1B in a variety of carcinomatoses, being able to improve the extensive comprehension of HNF1B's role in tumorigenesis."
39885371,Genomic biomarkers of survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer undergoing intensified androgen deprivation therapy.,"INTRODUCTION: Androgen deprivation therapy intensification (ADTi) with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI), docetaxel or both has been shown to improve survival outcomes in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Currently, baseline tumor genomic markers have no role in clinical decision-making in patients with mHSPC. METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective study, patients diagnosed with mHSPC who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling from primary tissue or metastatic sites and treated with ADTi were included. Genomic alterations with an incidence >/=5% were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were eligible and included in the study. In the multivariable analysis, TP53 (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.17-2.49, p = 0.006), RB1 (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.28-4.18, p = 0.006), PTEN (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12-2.7, p = 0.014), and BRCA2 (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.42-4.92, p = 0.003) were associated with significantly shorter PFS, while TP53 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.00-2.64, p = 0.049), RB1 (HR 4.5, 95% CI 2.32-8.70, p < 0.001), and PTEN (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.38-4.2, p = 0.003) were associated with significantly worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest studies to show the association of baseline tumor genomic markers with survival in patients with mHSPC treated with ADTi. Upon external validation, these results may aid in developing a clinical-genomic risk stratification model, patient counseling, and prognostication."
39884884,Final Overall Survival and Molecular Data Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Patients Receiving Ipatasertib and Abiraterone in the Phase 3 IPATential150 Trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the phase 3 IPATential150 trial, ipatasertib addition to abiraterone significantly reduced the risk of disease progression in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with PTEN loss on immunohistochemistry (IHC), but not in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Here we report the final overall survival (OS) analysis and present results for prespecified and exploratory biomarker analyses. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive ipatasertib (400 mg once daily) or placebo. All patients received abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily). OS was assessed in patients with PTEN loss on IHC and the ITT population. Exploratory biomarker analyses included PTEN status via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other key genomic alterations. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: At final analysis (median follow-up 33.9 mo), ipatasertib addition did not improve OS for patients with PTEN loss in IHC (n = 521; stratified hazard ratio [sHR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.17; p = 0.57) or the ITT population (n = 1101; sHR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.07; not formally tested). Exploratory NGS assessments identified subgroups with genomic PTEN loss (n = 208) or PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations (n = 250), with potentially better outcomes from ipatasertib (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.07; and HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.96, respectively). Limitations include the exploratory nature of the analysis, incomplete availability of NGS data, and potential intrapatient heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Ipatasertib addition to abiraterone did not improve OS for men with mCRPC, regardless of PTEN status on IHC. Exploratory biomarker analyses identified additional genomic alterations of potential clinical relevance for AKT blockade in mCRPC that require further validation in prospective studies."
39883857,Effects of Chemical Pretreatments of Wood Cellulose Nanofibrils on Protein Adsorption and Biological Outcomes.,"Wood-based nanocellulose is emerging as a promising nanomaterial in the field of tissue engineering due to its unique properties and versatile applications. Previously, we used TEMPO-mediated oxidation (TO) and carboxymethylation (CM) as chemical pretreatments prior to mechanical fibrillation of wood-based cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to produce scaffolds with different surface chemistries. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of these chemical pretreatments on serum protein adsorption on 2D and 3D configurations of TO-CNF and CM-CNF and then to investigate their effects on cell adhesion, spreading, inflammatory mediator production in vitro, and the development of foreign body reaction (FBR) in vivo. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the surface chemistry played a key role in determining the proteomic profile and significantly influenced the behavior of periodontal ligament fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2). The surface of TO-CNF 2D samples showed the highest protein adsorption followed by TO-CNF 3D samples. CM-CNF 2D samples adsorbed a higher number of proteins than their 3D counterparts. None of the CNF scaffolds showed toxicity in vitro or in vivo. However, carboxymethylation pretreatment negatively affected the adhesion, morphology, and spreading of both cell types. Although the CNF materials displayed clear differences in surface chemistry and proteomic profiles, both triggered the same foreign body response after being subcutaneously implanted in rats for 90 days. This observation highlights that the degradation rate of CNF scaffolds plays a central role in maintaining the foreign body response in vivo. It is imperative to comprehend the impact of chemical pretreatments of CNFs on protein adsorption and their interaction with diverse host cell types prior to the investigation of potential modifications. This knowledge is indispensable for the advancement of CNFs in regenerative applications within tissue engineering."
39882449,"Gut microbiota, metabolites, and cytokines in relation to the risk of prostate cancer in the Asian population.","PURPOSE: Studies have shown that gut microbiota is involved in the tumorigenesis and development of prostate cancer. We aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of causal associations of gut microbiota, metabolites, and cytokines with prostate cancer in the Asian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets were collected from the public databases. There were 418 bacterial traits, 452 metabolites, 91 cytokines, 5408 cases of prostate cancer from East Asia, and 109,347 controls included. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate their causal relationships. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the reliability of MR results. Furthermore, the FinnGen database was used to assess the generalizability of our findings based on Asians. RESULTS: There were a total of 17 bacterial traits, 28 metabolites (including 2 microbiota-associated metabolites), and 9 cytokines to be significantly associated with prostate cancer in Asians (P < 0.05). Further MR analyses of these positive results indicated that G_Ruminococcaceae UCG014/TNFSF10 axis, G_Anaerofilum/TNFRSF14 axis, G_Erysipelotrichaceae UCG003/TNFSF10 axis, and P_Proteobacteria/cholesterol axis were key signaling pathways involved in the progression of prostate cancer. Notably, G_Ruminococcaceae UCG014/TNFSF10 axis and G_Anaerofilum/TNFRSF14 axis were found to act as protective factors, while the other two signaling axes played a crucial role in promoting the progression of prostate cancer. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the reliability of our findings. Using the European population as outcome, we further assessed the generalizability of our conclusions and found limited applicability to Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: We found that there were causal associations of gut microbiota, metabolites, and cytokines with prostate cancer in Asians. The causal effects of gut microbiota on prostate cancer were partially mediated by metabolites and cytokines. These findings might contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer."
39881417,Comprehensive analysis of the interaction microbiome and prostate cancer: an initial exploration from multi-cohort metagenome and GWAS studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States with a high mortality rate. In recent years, the traditional opinion about prostate microbiome was challenged. Although there still are some arguments, an escalating number of researchers are shifting their focus toward the microbiome within the prostate tumor environment. METHODS: We mined the data of the microbiome extracted from the metagenome, and it offers a broader taxonomic coverage and accurate functional profiling. We used Kraken2, a mapping tool, to mine the gut microbiota of prostate cancer patients. A two-sample Mendelian Randomization was conducted to reflect the association between gut microbiome and cancer. RESULTS: In the study, we found the consistency of the special intratumor microbiome of both non-metastatic tumors and metastatic tumors. And we dig the gut microbiome in patients with different treatments. We found that some microbiotas may be associated with prostate cancer progression and a special microbiome in metastatic prostate cancer may exist. The anti-androgen therapy can significantly change both the intratumor and gut microbiome. CONCLUSION: With the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer, some intratumor microbiome changes. And anti-androgen influences both the intratumor and gut microbiome. Our discovery may help researchers further understand the progression, metastasis, and resistance of prostate cancer from the perspective of microbiome level."
39879834,"Pan-cancer analysis of DCBLD1 and its association with the diagnosis, immunotherapy, and prognosis of cervical cancer.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CESC) is a leading cause of death attributed to cancer worldwide. Advanced-stage cervical cancer presents unique challenges, such as few treatment modalities. Though DCBLD1 has been earlier connected to a variety of cancers, there has been no extensive investigation on DCBLD1 regarding cervical cancer. This study seeks to assess the expression and prognostic significance of DCBLD1 in multiple cancer types, heavily relying on cervical cancer, as well as its implications on immune modulation. METHODS: The pan-cancer expression of box-like genes in DCBLD1 was investigated in 33 cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Survival analyses involving Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS) were conducted to evaluate the relationship between DCBLD1 expression and the prognosis of these neoplasms. Furthermore, immune infiltration gene co-expression and tumor microenvironment (TME) analyses were performed. In vitro assays in cervical cancer cell lines were done to analyze the functional impact of silencing DCBLD1 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. RESULTS: DCBLD1 was significantly overexpressed in 16 cancer types, including cervical cancer, and was associated with poor prognosis for several of these cancer types. In CESC, the expression of DCBLD1 was significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS. While immune infiltration analysis showed a significant association for DCBLD1 with several immune cells, including CD4+ memory T cells and macrophages, the functional assays demonstrated that silencing DCBLD1 in cervical cancer cells inhibited their cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, implicating it in tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: DCBLD1 could serve as an amendable biomarker of poor prognosis in cervical cancer and other cancers whose high expression level correlates with immune infiltration, which may suggest its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment. This shows that targeting DCBLD1 could prove effective as a potential therapeutic modality in conjunction with other immune-based therapies for cervical cancer."
39878408,Transcriptome-Wide Association Study Identified Novel Blood Tissue Gene Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Risk.,"OBJECTIVE: A number of susceptibility genes in prostate tissue have been identified to be associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk. However, the reported genes based on assessing prostate tissue could not fully explain PCa genetic susceptibility. It is believed that genes functioning in the immune system may fill in the gap of some missing heritability. METHODS: To study potential susceptibility genes acting in such pathways, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of 79,194 PCa cases and 61,112 control of European ancestry by using three sets of gene expression prediction models of blood tissue. RESULTS: A total of 470 genes were associated at false discovery rates-corrected p-value < 0.05, of which 51 were implicated as likely causal genes based on fine-mapping analysis. Compared with previous literature, 133 novel genes were reported for the first time. Of the identified genes, five (CREB3L4, GSTP1, MAPK3, NKX3-1, and PIK3C2B) were enriched in a PCa signaling pathway, and 128 genes were enriched in five PCa categories. Importantly, 13 genes (SCP2, LMNA, ZNF148, H2AFV, TACC1, FLII, SUPT4H1, CD300LF, MYO9B, COX6B1, CTSA, EP300, and TSPO) showed consistent effect directions for the measured levels in circulating immune cells between PCa cases and controls, and 14 genes (SLC39A1, ZBTB7B, TRIM59, NCEH1, N4BP2, TAGAP, TACC1, TRAF1, AIP, SECTM1, C18orf54, ZNF793, YIF1B, and TSPO) showed consistency for levels in blood exosomes between PCa patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The identified blood-based candidate susceptibility genes provide further insights into the genetic basis of PCa risk."
39875925,Risk of residual/recurrent cervical diseases in HPV-positive women post-conization depends on HPV integration status.,"BACKGROUND: It is crucial to identify post-operative patients with HPV infection who are at high risk for residual/recurrent disease. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HPV integration and clinical outcomes in HPV-positive women after cervical conization, as well as to identify HPV integration breakpoints. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data of 791 women who underwent cervical conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (CIN2-3) between September 2019 and September 2023, sourced from the Fujian and Hubei cervical lesion screening cohorts. Among these, 73 women with HPV infection post-conization underwent HPV integration test within 3 months after a positive HPV test. HPV integration test was performed using the high-throughput viral integration detection (HIVID), a sensitive method for genome-wide survey of HPV integration breakpoints. RESULTS: Among the 73 participants with HPV infection post-conization, 10 cases (13.7%) were positive for HPV integration. The logistic regression analysis showed a higher residual/recurrent lesions risk in patients with HPV integration (OR = 3.917, p = 0.048). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, age >/= 45 years (p = 0.016) and HPV integration (p = 0.035) were associated with a higher risk of residual/recurrent CIN at the 1-year follow-up. HPV 52 accounted for the majority of HPV integration genotype (3/10, 30.0%). Surprisingly, HPV 16 had the highest number of HPV average integration sequencing reads (n = 129), followed by HPV 31, 58, 52, 59, 35, and 39. The study also identified 13 HPV breakpoints, including TP63, TLR4, USP10, etc. CONCLUSIONS: HPV integration was identified as an independent risk factor for residual/recurrent CIN in HPV-positive women post-conization. Women with positive HPV integration should pay attention to careful post-treatment follow-up."
39875232,"Interleukin-17: A pleiotropic cytokine implicated in inflammatory, infectious, and malignant disorders.","IL-17A, referred to as IL-17, is the founding member of a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (or IL-25), and IL-17F, which act via receptors IL-17RA to IL-17RE, and elicit potent cellular responses that impact diverse diseases. IL-17's interactions with various cytokines include forming a heterodimer with IL-17F and being stimulated by IL-23's activation of Th17 cells, which can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. IL-17 is implicated in infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, promoting neutrophil recruitment and anti-bacterial immunity, but potentially exacerbating fungal and viral infections, revealing its dual role as protective and pathologic. IL-17 is also involved in various cancers, including breast, colon, cervical, prostate, and skin cancer, contributing to proliferation, immune invasion, and metastases, but also playing a protective role in certain instances. Four FDA-approved drugs-secukinumab (for ankylosing spondylitis, enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis), ixekizumab (for ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis), brodalumab (for plaque psoriasis), and bimekizumab (for plaque psoriasis)-suppress the IL-17 pathway, with more in development, including netakimab, sonelokimab, izokibep, and CJM112. These agents and others are being studied across a spectrum of disorders. Understanding the complicated interplay between IL-17 and other immune mediators may yield new treatments for inflammatory/autoimmune conditions and malignancies."
39875054,The urinary eccDNA landscape in prostate cancer reveals associations with genome instability and vital roles in cancer progression.,"INTRODUCTION: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays significant roles in cancer progression and prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether cell-free eccDNA, considered more stable than linear DNA, possesses cancer-specific genomic features. Furthermore, the biogenesis and function of eccDNAs are not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize the genomic landscape of urinary cell-free eccDNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) and non-cancer (NC) individuals, elucidate their biogenesis and PCa-specific genomic features, and investigate their roles in PCa progression. METHODS: We conducted urine Circle-seq for 21 PCa patients and 16 NC individuals, performed integrated analysis with other omics datasets, and finally validated the function of eccDNA by in vitro transfection and RNA-seq. RESULTS: We pioneered the profiling of urinary cell-free eccDNAs landscape in PCa and uncovered a high association between eccDNA generation and active chromatin status as well as gene transcription. Double strand breaks and R-loops, which preferentially occur in active genomic sites and cause genome instability, can promote eccDNA generation. Genome instability frequently results in genomic mutations, and our study further established a link between eccDNA generation and oncogenic mutations. Additionally, genes specifically exhibiting high eccDNA generation frequency (HFGs) in PCa contributed to PCa progression and were associated with poorer survival outcomes in PCa patients. Finally, we demonstrated that eccDNAs derived from PCa-specific HFGs, in contrast to intergenic eccDNAs, could suppress PCa cell proliferation and migration, which was independent of their host gene expression. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrated the biogenesis of eccDNAs from DSBs in active genes, revealed PCa-specific eccDNA features and suggested new mechanisms underlying eccDNA function."
39874495,Coding Variants of the Genitourinary Development Gene WNT9B Carry High Risk for Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Considerable genetic heterogeneity is currently thought to underlie hereditary prostate cancer (HPC). Most families meeting criteria for HPC cannot be attributed to currently known pathogenic variants. METHODS: To discover pathogenic variants predisposing to prostate cancer, we conducted a familial case-control association study using both genome-wide single-allele and identity-by-descent analytic approaches. Sequence of high-risk haplotype carriers was used for variant detection. Candidate pathogenic variants were tested for association with prostate cancer across independent biobanks for replication of observations. RESULTS: Pathogenic variants within WNT9B were associated with familial prostate cancer and observations replicated within four of four independent biobanks. WNT9B E152K carried 2.5-fold risk and reached genome-wide significance under meta-analysis, collectively encompassing a half million patients. WNT9B Q47R was also associated with prostate cancer with genome-wide significance among Finns, for which identity-by-descent analyses confirmed a founder effect. WNT9B shares an unexpected commonality with the previously established prostate cancer risk genes HOXB13 and HNF1B: they are each required for embryonic prostate development. With this recognition, we further evaluated two additional genes known to cause Mendelian genitourinary developmental defects, KMT2D and DHCR7. These too were nominally associated with prostate cancer under meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: WNT9B and additional genes that are required for early genitourinary development are also involved in the later development of prostate cancer."
39874304,Bacterial vaginosis is associated with transcriptomic changes but not higher concentrations of cervical leukocytes in a study of women at high risk for HIV acquisition.,"BACKGROUND: The association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and increased HIV acquisition risk may be related to concentrations of HIV-susceptible immune cells in the cervix. METHODS: Participants (31 with BV and 30 with normal microbiota) underwent cervical biopsy at a single visit. Immune cells were quantified and sorted using flow cytometry (N=55), localization assessed by immunofluorescence (N=16), and function determined by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of live CD45+ cells (N=21). RESULTS: Linear regression analyses demonstrated no differences in mean log2 [cells/mg tissue] between women with BV vs normal microbiota for antigen presenting cell (APC) subtypes linked to HIV risk (including CD1a+HLA-DR+ Langerhans cells, CD11c+CD14+ dendritic cells [DCs], and CD11c+HLA-DR+ DCs) and CD4+ T cells. Women with BV had a higher median proportion of CD11c+HLA-DR+ APCs (out of total cells) in cervical epithelium (0.1% vs 0.0%; p=0.03 using Mann-Whitney testing). RNA-seq identified 1,032 differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value <0.05) in CD45+ cells between women with BV vs normal microbiota. Women with BV demonstrated downregulation of pathways linked to translation, metabolism, cell stress, and immune signaling. CONCLUSIONS: BV alters immune cell localization and function; future studies are needed to address how these changes may mediate HIV acquisition risk."
39873931,"BRN3A, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of genes involved in biological processes shaping the HPV induced cervical cancer.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide in females. This occurs primarily due to the infection of high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), although in advanced stages it requires support from host cellular factors. BRN3A is one such host cellular factors, whose expression remains high in cervical cancers and upregulates tumorigenic HPV gene expression. The effect of BRN3A on HPV-mediated cervical cancer and the underlying mechanism remains obscure. OBJECTIVE: To investigates the effect of BRN3A on cancer-promoting biological processes in HPV-positive uterine cervix cancer cells. METHODS: We have altered the expression of BRN3A through over-expression (OE) and knock-down (KD) constructs in cervical cancer cell line, SiHa, and did transcriptome profiling through next-generation RNA-sequencing, validation through RT-PCR and BRN3A binding study with in silico promoter study and ChIP PCR methods. RESULTS: This study revealed a substantial change in the expression of several genes associated with cancer-promoting biological processes including viral processes, immune response, cell-death, cell-proliferation, different signaling pathways, etc. Additionally, promoter analysis through in silico mode revealed that a total of 32.7% of genes possess BRN3A binding sites at their promoters. Physical interaction of BRN3A with IFITM1, OAS3, ISG15, BCL2L1 and HSP90AB1 genes was also confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified molecular targets of BRN3A and provided new insight into the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. According to our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect on eukaryotic transcriptomes after over-expression and knocking down BRN3A."
39873726,Size-Dependent Separation of Extracellular Vesicle Subtypes with Exodisc Enabling Proteomic Analysis in Prostate Cancer.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as crucial biomarkers in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics with their heterogeneity presenting both challenges and opportunities in prostate cancer research. However, existing methods for isolating and characterizing EV subtypes have been limited by inefficient separation and inadequate proteomic analysis. Here we show an optimized centrifugal microfluidic device, Exodisc, that efficiently isolates large quantities of EV subtypes from particle-enriched medium, enabling comprehensive proteomic analysis of small (EV-S, 20-200 nm) and large (EV-L, >200 nm) EVs. Using this device, we successfully separated EV-S and EV-L from prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC3. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics revealed that EV proteins reflect parental cell characteristics more than EV size, with EV-L demonstrating increased expression of PSMA-correlated proteins. Our optimized protocol addresses challenges in EV isolation and characterization, providing a more effective method for studying cellular and molecular mechanisms of specific EV subtypes. This study extends the potential use of EVs as a liquid biopsy for cancer theranostics, paving the way for more precise isolation of EV subtypes and potentially leading to improved biomarker discovery and the development of personalized treatments."
39872368,"Integrative analysis of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs: Unveiling prognostic significance, immune microenvironment, and copper-induced mechanisms in prostate cancer.","BACKGROUND: Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and influence cancer development and progression. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered form of cell death, plays an important role in cancer. Nonetheless, additional research investigating the association between cuproptosis-related lncRNAs and prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis is required. METHODS: Sequencing data and copy number variant data were obtained from 492 patients with PCa from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program. Prognostic models of PCa based on cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were constructed using a multi-level attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN) deep learning algorithm. Immune escape scoring was performed using Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion. Cellular experiments were conducted to explore the correlation between key lncRNAs and cuproptosis. RESULTS: Data from 492 patients with PCa were randomized into two groups at a 1:1 ratio. Prognostic modeling was successfully established using MLA-GNN. Survival analysis suggested that patients could be divided into high- and low-risk groups according to model scores and that there was a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) (P < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) indicated a strong predictive performance for the model, with AUCs of 0.913, 0.847, and 0.863 for the training group and 0.815, 0.907, and 0.866 for the test group at 12, 36, and 60 months, respectively. The immune escape score and immune microenvironment analysis suggested that the high-risk group corresponded to a stronger immune escape and a poorer immune microenvironment (P < 0.05). Cellular experiments revealed that the expression of all six key lncRNAs was upregulated in the presence of copper ion carriers (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified cuproptosis-related lncRNAs that were strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Key lncRNAs could affect copper metabolism and may serve as new therapeutic targets."
39870236,Lactoferrin conjugated radicicol nanoparticles enhanced drug delivery and cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells.,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) plays a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism by regulating the glycolytic pathway. Although, inhibitors targeting PDK1 have been effective in inhibiting glycolysis in multiple cancers, their lack of selectivity leading to off-target effects limit their therapeutic benefit. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory potential of six PDK1 inhibitors on cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-negative PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Of the six PDK1 inhibitors, radicicol and dicumarol significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and exhibited lower metabolic activity in both LNCaP and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells. Radicicol was highly effective at lower concentration. Moreover, radicicol significantly inhibited migration and invasion in PC-3 cells. We then developed a lactoferrin nanoparticle (LF-NP) encapsulated with Radicicol (Ra-LF-NP), using a rotary evaporation method. Spheroid assays confirmed the higher inhibitory potential of Ra-LF-NP with a reduction in spheroid area by 80%, and invasiveness compared to radicicol alone. Lactoferrin receptors are overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cells, including prostate cancer. Conjugating radicicol with lactoferrin nanoparticles, potentially enhanced the specific uptake of the drug by prostate cancer cells while minimizing the off-target effects on healthy cells. This targeted therapy approach could lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects. Our study demonstrated the potential of radicicol delivery by lactoferrin-conjugated nanoparticle as an efficient drug delivery strategy for prostate cancer treatment."
39869819,An Artificial Intelligence Model Using Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging Metrics Accurately Predicts Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Conventional prostate magnetic resonance imaging has limited accuracy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We performed diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) before biopsy and applied artificial intelligence models to these DBSI metrics to predict csPCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2020 and March 2024, 241 patients underwent prostate MRI that included conventional and DBSI-specific sequences before prostate biopsy. We used artificial intelligence models with DBSI metrics as input classifiers and the biopsy pathology as the ground truth. The DBSI-based model was compared with available biomarkers (PSA, PSA density [PSAD], and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS]) for risk discrimination of csPCa defined as Gleason score > 7. RESULTS: The DBSI-based model was an independent predictor of csPCa (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.52-2.73, P < .01), as were PSAD (OR 2.02, 95%CI 1.21-3.35, P = .01) and PI-RADS classification (OR 4.00, 95%CI 1.37-11.6 for PI-RADS 3, P = .01; OR 9.67, 95%CI 2.89-32.7, for PI-RADS 4-5, P < .01), adjusting for age, family history, and race. Within our data set, the DBSI-based model alone performed similarly to PSAD + PI-RADS (AUC 0.863 vs 0.859, P = .89), while the combination of the DBSI-based model + PI-RADS had the highest risk discrimination for csPCa (AUC 0.894, P < .01). A clinical strategy using the DBSI-based model for patients with PI-RADS 1-3 could have reduced biopsies by 27% while missing 2% of csPCa (compared with biopsy for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our DBSI-based artificial intelligence model accurately predicted csPCa on biopsy and can be combined with PI-RADS to potentially reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies."
39869504,Label-Free and Sequence-Independent Isothermal Amplification Strategy for the Simultaneous Detection of Genomic 5-Methylcytosine and 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine.,"5-Methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are crucial epigenetic modifications in eukaryotic genomic DNA that regulate gene expression and are associated with the occurrence of various cancers. Here, we combined bisulfite conversion with 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxopiperridinium tetrafluoroborate (ACT(+)BF(4)(-), TCI) oxidation to develop a label-free and sequence-independent isothermal amplification (BTIA) assay for a genome-wide 5mC and 5hmC analysis. The BTIA strategy can distinguish 5mC and 5hmC signatures from other bases with high sensitivity and good specificity, avoiding sophisticated chemical modifications and expensive protein labeling. Moreover, the utilization of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enables the proposed strategy to detect global 5mC and 5hmC without sequence dependence. With only 78 ng of input of genomic DNA, global 5mC and 5hmC levels were accurately quantified in cells (including cancer cells of A549, T47D, and K562 and normal cells of HEK-293T, CHO, and NRK-52E) and clinical whole blood samples (including healthy control, precancerous cervical cancer, and confirmed cervical cancer) within 18 h. The detection results suggested that 5mC was highly expressed in cancer cells. More importantly, a significant increase in 5mC was observed in precancerous cervical cancer and further upregulation in confirmed cervical cancer, suggesting a correlation between 5mC and cancer occurrence and development. However, 5hmC showed the reverse result in these tested cells and clinical samples. Collectively, the BTIA strategy can be easily performed on the ordinary heating apparatus in almost all research and medical laboratories, showing a significant application in the early screening of cervical cancer in the clinic."
39867862,"Pan-Cancer Analysis Identifies YKT6 as a Prognostic and Immunotherapy Biomarker, with an Emphasis on Cervical Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion is crucial for autophagy, making YKT6, a key modulator of cell membrane fusion, a potential target for cancer therapy. However, its oncogenic role across different cancers remains unclear. This study was to investigate the prognostic value and potential immunological functions of YKT6, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). METHODS: Multiple bioinformatics databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases, were used to investigate the correlation of the YKT6 expression pattern with the pathological stage and survival rate across cancers. Furthermore, ImmuCellAI, the UCSC Xena platform, and the ESTIMATE algorithm were subsequently utilized to explore the potential relationship between YKT6 expression, the tumor microenvironment, and tumor immune infiltration. Profiling of YKT6 gene mutation and amplification, methylation, and copy number alteration (CNA) was performed on the basis of the TCGA database. Moreover, q-PCR, TMA staining, and siRNA assays were used to validate the cancer-promoting role of YKT6 in CESCs. RESULTS: Our results reveal that YKT6 is a potential prognostic and cancer immunity biomarker. Elevated YKT6 expression is correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Distinct gene mutation, methylation, and CNA patterns for YKT6 were found in certain types of cancers. The correlation of YKT6 expression with tumor-infiltrating immune cells was verified by analyzing the StromalScore, ESTIMATEScore, ImmuneScore, and tumor purity. In vitro analysis confirmed that YKT6 was highly expressed in advanced-grade CESCs and that the knockdown of YKT6 inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The SNARE protein YKT6 serves as a biomarker and candidate oncogene with actionable mutations. Moreover, YKT6 has the potential to be a prognostic indicator in CESCs. Targeting YKT6 could enhance autophagy regulation and improve therapeutic strategies for personalized cancer treatment."
39864534,Future directions in the evaluation and management of newly diagnosed metastatic cancer.,"There is much debate regarding optimal selection in patients with metastatic cancer who should undergo local treatment (surgery or radiation treatment) to the primary tumor and/or metastases. Additionally, the optimal treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic cancer is largely unclear. Current prognostication systems to best inform these clinical scenarios are limited, as all metastatic patients are grouped together as having Stage IV disease without further incorporation of patient and disease-specific covariates that significantly impact patient outcomes. Therefore, improving current prognostic scoring systems and incorporation of these covariates is essential to best individualize treatment for patients with metastatic cancer. In this narrative review article, we provide a detailed review of prognostication systems that can be used for both the site of metastasis and primary site to best tailor treatment in these patients. Additionally, we discuss the incorporation and ongoing developments in radiographic, genomic, and biostatistical techniques that can be used as prognostication tools."
39863927,GITRL enhances cytotoxicity and persistence of CAR-T cells in cancer therapy.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success in treating hematological malignancies. However, its clinical efficacy in solid tumors is less satisfactory, partially due to poor in vivo expansion and the limited persistence of CAR-T cells. Here, we demonstrated that the overexpression of GITR ligand enhances the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells. Compared to prostate-specific membrane antigen-BB-Z (PSMA-BB-Z) CAR-T, PSMA-BB-Z-GITRL CAR-T cells have much more interferon (IFN)-gamma, TNF-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-9 secretion, a higher proportion of central memory T (T(CM)) cells and T helper 9 (Th9) cells, less expression of exhaustion markers, and robust proliferation capacity. Consequently, PSMA-BB-Z-GITRL CAR-T cells exhibited more potent anti-tumor activity against established solid tumors in vivo than PSMA-BB-Z CAR-T cells. The results of the in vivo persistence experiment also indicated that PSMA-BB-Z-GITRL CAR-T cells exhibited much more retention in mouse blood, spleen, and tumor tissue than PSMA-BB-Z CAR-T cells 15 days after CAR-T cell therapy. In addition, PSMA-BB-Z-GITRL CAR-T cells produce higher levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-9 in mouse blood, exhibiting a higher proportion of T(CM) cells and a lower proportion of Treg cells compared to PSMA-BB-Z CAR-T cells. Our results demonstrate that the overexpression of GITRL has important implications for improving CAR-T cell-based human solid tumor immunotherapy."
39863894,Reverse-engineering the FLT3-PI3K/AKT axis to enhance TILs function and improve prognosis in ovarian and cervical cancers.,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancers (OC) and cervical cancers (CC) have poor survival rates. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play a pivotal role in prognosis, but shared immune mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to explore immune regulation in OC and CC, focusing on the PI3K/AKT pathway and FLT3 as key modulators. Seurat and Harmony were employed for batch correction and dimensionality reduction. FLT3 expression was mapped with spatial data from 10 x Genomics. RESULTS: FLT3, identified as a regulator through the PI3K/AKT pathway, showed positive correlations with T cells, NK cells, and B cells. FLT3-high regions exhibited increased immune infiltration, particularly in CC, enhancing survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first spatially resolved evidence of FLT3's immune-modulatory role in OC and CC, positioning it as a promising immunotherapeutic target. FLT3-targeted strategies may offer new options for patients resistant to conventional therapies."
39859530,A Haplotype GWAS in Syndromic Familial Colorectal Cancer.,"A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with gastric and/or prostate cancer in their families suggested genetic loci with a shared risk for these three cancers. A second haplotype GWAS was undertaken in the same colorectal cancer patients and different controls with the aim of confirming the result and finding novel loci. The haplotype GWAS analysis involved 685 patients with colorectal cancer cases and 1642 healthy controls from Sweden. A logistic regression model was used with a sliding window haplotype approach. Whole-genome and exome sequencing datawere used to find candidate SNPs to be tested in a nested case-control study. In the analysis of 685 colorectal cancer cases and 1642 controls, all ten candidate loci from the previous study were confirmed. Fifty candidate loci were suggested with a p-value < 5 x 10(-6) and odds ratios between 1.35-6.52. Two of the 50 loci, on 13q33.3 and 16q23.3, were the same as in the previous study. Whole-genome or exome data from 122 colorectal cancer patients was used to search for candidate variants in these 50 loci. A nested case-control study was performed to test genetic variants at 11 loci in a cohort of 827 familial colorectal cancer and a sub-cohort of 293 familial CRC cases with colorectal, gastric, and/or prostate cancer within their families and 1530 healthy controls. One SNP, rs115943733 on 10q11.21, reached statistical significance (OR = 3.26, p = 0.009). Seven SNPs in 4 loci had a higher OR in the smaller cohort compared to the larger study CRC cases. The results in this GWAS gave support for suggested loci with an increased shared risk of CRC, gastric, and/or prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm the shared risk to be able to use this information in cancer prevention."
39859392,Clinical and Genomic Features of Androgen Indifferent Prostate Cancer.,"Androgen-indifferent prostate cancer (AIPC) is increasingly common and particularly lethal. Data describing these tumors are sparse, and AIPC remains a poorly understood malignancy. Utilizing the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) database, we enriched for tumors with features of AIPC using previously described characteristics. Our AIPC cohort included three subgroups: aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), neuroendocrine PC (NEPC), and double-negative PC (DNPC). Of 1496 total PC patients available for analysis, we identified 323 (22%) as MCRPC. Of those, 39 (12%) met AIPC criteria (17 AVPC, 13 NEPC, 9 DNPC) and 284 (88%) were non-AIPC. Forty-three percent of AIPC patients had de novo metastatic disease vs. 15% for non-AIPC (p = 0.003). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not differ between cohorts, but microsatellite instability scores (MSI) were significantly higher in AIPC (p = 0.019). Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we found that genes defining response to androgens and genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation were the most downregulated, whereas genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune signaling were significantly upregulated in AIPC vs. non-AIPC. Our study demonstrates the potential for predefined criteria that aim to enrich for AIPC and suggests opportunities for therapeutic investigation."
39859345,"Molecular Mechanisms of Dietary Compounds in Cancer Stem Cells from Solid Tumors: Insights into Colorectal, Breast, and Prostate Cancer.","Cancer stem cells (CSC) are known to be the main source of tumor relapse, metastasis, or multidrug resistance and the mechanisms to counteract or eradicate them and their activity remain elusive. There are different hypotheses that claim that the origin of CSC might be in regular stem cells (SC) and, due to accumulation of mutations, these normal cells become malignant, or the source of CSC might be in any malignant cell that, under certain environmental circumstances, acquires all the qualities to become CSC. Multiple studies indicate that lifestyle and diet might represent a source of wellbeing that can prevent and ameliorate the malignant phenotype of CSC. In this review, after a brief introduction to SC and CSC, we analyze the effects of phenolic and non-phenolic dietary compounds and we highlight the molecular mechanisms that are shown to link diets to CSC activation in colon, breast, and prostate cancer. We focus the analysis on specific markers such as sphere formation, CD surface markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and on the major signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-kappaB, Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt/beta-catenin in CSC. In conclusion, a better understanding of how bioactive compounds in our diets influence the dynamics of CSC can raise valuable awareness towards reducing cancer risk."
39858458,SNP rs9364554 Modulates Androgen Receptor Binding and Drug Response in Prostate Cancer.,"(1) Background: Prostate cancer treatment efficacy is significantly influenced by androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. SLC22A3, a membrane transporter, has been linked to SNP rs9364554 risk loci for drug efficacy in prostate cancer. (2) Methods: We examined the location of SNP rs9364554 in the genome and utilized TCGA and other publicly available datasets to analyze the association of this SNP with SLC22A3 transcription levels. We verified onco-mining findings in prostate cancer cell lines using quantitative PCR and Western blots. Additionally, we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to detect the binding affinity of transcription factors to this SNP. The ChIP-Seq was used to analyze the enrichment of H3K27ac on the SLC22A3 promoter. (3) Results: In this study, we revealed that SNP rs9364554 resides in the SLC22A3 gene and affects its transcription. The downregulation of SLC22A3 is associated with drug resistance. More importantly, we found that this SNP has different binding affinities with transcription factors, specifically FOXA1 and AR, which significantly affects their regulation of SLC22A3 transcription. (4) Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential of using this SNP as a biomarker for predicting chemotherapeutic outcomes and uncover possible mechanisms underlying drug resistance in advanced prostate cancers. More importantly, it provides a clinical foundation for targeting FOXA1 to enhance drug efficacy in prostate cancer patients."
39857769,Identifying MTHFD1 and LGALS4 as Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer Through Multi-Omics Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Background: Prostate cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide. The treatment of it is currently based on surgical removal, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy. It is crucial to improve therapeutic prospects for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer via drug target screening. Methods: We integrated eQTL data from the eQTLGen Consortium and pQTL data from UK Biobank Proteome Plasma Proteins (UKB-PPP) and deCODE health datasets. MR analyses (SMR, heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI), IVW, Wald ratio, weighted median, and MR-Egger) were used to screen candidate genes associated with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) risk. Candidate genes were further verified through TCGA-based gene expression profile, survival analysis, and immune microenvironment evaluations. TIDE analysis was utilized to investigate gene immunotherapy response. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GSE176031 dataset were used to investigate the gene expression patterns. The Drug Bank, Therapeutic Target Database and Drug Signatures Database were utilized to predict targeted drugs for candidate genes. Results: MTHFD1 and LGALS4 were identified as promising therapeutic targets for PRAD, with evidence provided at multi-omics levels. LGALS4 was predominantly expressed in malignant cells and was correlated with enhanced immune checkpoint pathways, increased TIDE scores, and immunotherapy resistance. In contrast, MTHFD1was expressed in both tumor and microenvironmental cells and was associated with poor survival. Drug target prediction suggested that there are no currently approved drugs specifically targeting MTHFD1 and LGALS4. Conclusions: Our study identified MTHFD1 and LGALS4 as potential preventive targets for PRAD. However, future experiments are warranted to assess the utility and effectiveness of these candidate proteins."
39857609,Unveiling DENND2D as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Recurrence: From Gene to Prognosis.,"Background: Prostate cancer is a major global health burden, with biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy affecting 20-40% of patients and posing significant challenges to prognosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests a critical role for differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cell (DENN) domain-containing genes in oncogenesis; however, their implications in prostate cancer and BCR risk remain underexplored. Methods: This study systematically evaluated 151 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in DENN domain-containing genes in 458 patients with prostate cancer and BCR, followed by validation in an independent cohort of 185 patients. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified DENND2D rs610261 G>A as significantly associated with improved BCR-free survival in both cohorts (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.66, p = 0.001). Functional analysis revealed rs610261's regulatory potential, with the protective A allele correlating with increased DENND2D expression in various human tissues. Compared to normal prostate tissues, DENND2D expression was reduced in prostate cancer, with higher expression being linked to favorable patient prognosis (p = 0.03). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed an association between DENND2D expression and the negative regulation of MYC target genes, including MAD2L1, ERH, and CLNS1A, which are overexpressed in prostate cancer and associated with poor survival. Furthermore, the elevated DENND2D expression promotes immune infiltration in prostate cancer, supporting its role in immune modulation. Conclusions:DENND2D is a prognostic biomarker for BCR in prostate cancer and offers new avenues for personalized treatment strategies."
39856701,Circular RNA circBNC2 inhibits tumorigenesis by modulating ferroptosis and acts as a nanotherapeutic target in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related death in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of the metastasis of various cancers. However, the functional effects and regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) remain largely unknown. METHODS: The expression of circBNC2 in prostate cancer (PCa), CRPC and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) tissues was analyzed through bioinformatics analysis. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and ferroptosis, were conducted in vitro and in vivo. The interactions between circBNC2, miR-4298, and ACSL6 were explored via luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and western blotting analysis. In addition, for the first time in PCa, we developed novel nanobowls (NBs) loaded with docetaxel (DTX) and circBNC2 (Dc-NBs) and evaluated the antitumor efficacy of Dc-NBs in a photothermal therapy (PTT) strategy. RESULTS: We identified a novel tumor-suppressive circRNA, circBNC2, in human PCa, CRPC and NEPC samples via bioinformatic analysis. CircBNC2 expression was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and PCa cell lines. Functional assays demonstrated that circBNC2 inhibited PCa cell proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circBNC2 acted as a sponge for miR-4298, and ACSL6 was identified as a direct target of the circBNC2/miR-4298 axis. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACSL6 is essential for mediating circBNC2-regulated ferroptosis in PCa cells. More importantly, we demonstrated the nanodelivery of Dc-NBs, which exhibited significant antitumor effects in both subcutaneous and metastatic PCa models. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the tumor-suppressive role of circBNC2 in mCRPC by driving ferroptosis via the circBNC2/miR-4298/ACSL6 axis. Additionally, we developed an efficient and safe PTT strategy based on a nanodelivery system that codelivers circBNC2 and DTX, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for mCRPC."
39855832,Exploring the mechanism of Xiaoaiping Injection inhibiting autophagy in prostate cancer based on proteomics.,"Xiaoaiping (XAP) Injection demonstrates the anti-prostate cancer (PCa) effects, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the impact of XAP on PCa and elucidate its mechanism of action. PCa cell proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed through Hoechst staining and Western blotting assays. Proteomics technology was employed to identify key molecules and significant signaling pathways modulated by XAP in PCa cells. To further validate potential key genes and important pathways, a series of assays were conducted, including acridine orange (AO) staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence assays. The molecular mechanism of XAP against PCa in vivo was examined using a PC3 xenograft mouse model. Results demonstrated that XAP significantly inhibited cell proliferation in multiple PCa cell lines. In C4-2 and prostate cancer cell line-3 (PC3) cells, XAP induced cellular apoptosis, evidenced by reduced B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) levels and elevated Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) levels. Proteomic, immunofluorescence, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) investigations revealed a strong correlation between forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) autophagic degradation and the anti-PCa action of XAP. XAP hindered autophagy by reducing the expression levels of autophagy-related protein 5 (Atg5)/autophagy-related protein 12 (Atg12) and enhancing FoxO3a expression and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, XAP exhibited potent anti-PCa action in PC3 xenograft mice and triggered FoxO3a nuclear translocation in tumor tissue. These findings suggest that XAP induces PCa apoptosis via inhibition of FoxO3a autophagic degradation, potentially offering a novel perspective on XAP injection as an effective anticancer therapy for PCa."
39853587,Epigenomics-guided precision oncology: Chromatin variants in prostate tumor evolution.,"Prostate cancer is a common malignancy that in 5%-30% leads to treatment-resistant and highly aggressive disease. Metastasis-potential and treatment-resistance is thought to rely on increased plasticity of the cancer cells-a mechanism whereby cancer cells alter their identity to adapt to changing environments or therapeutic pressures to create cellular heterogeneity. To understand the molecular basis of this plasticity, genomic studies have uncovered genetic variants to capture clonal heterogeneity of primary tumors and metastases. As cellular plasticity is largely driven by non-genetic events, complementary studies in cancer epigenomics are now being conducted to identify chromatin variants. These variants, defined as genomic loci in cancer cells that show changes in chromatin state due to the loss or gain of epigenomic marks, inclusive of histone post-translational modifications, DNA methylation and histone variants, are considered the fundamental units of epigenomic heterogeneity. In prostate cancer chromatin variants hold the promise of guiding the new era of precision oncology. In this review, we explore the role of epigenomic heterogeneity in prostate cancer, focusing on how chromatin variants contribute to tumor evolution and therapy resistance. We therefore discuss their impact on cellular plasticity and stochastic events, highlighting the value of single-cell sequencing and liquid biopsy epigenomic assays to uncover new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Ultimately, this review aims to support a new era of precision oncology, utilizing insights from epigenomics to improve prostate cancer patient outcomes."
39849679,Exploring the potential of BOLA3-DT as a diagnostic biomarker in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Exploring the potential of BOLA3-DT as a diagnostic biomarker in prostate cancer. METHODS: Expression of the lncRNA BOLA3-DT was analyzed between normal and tumor samples in the GDC TCGA PRAD (Genomic Data Commons: The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma Collection) dataset. Disease progression-related clinicopathological parameters such as serum PSA level (ng/ml) and Gleason score were associated with the expression of BOLA3-DT using the same GDC TCGA PRAD dataset. To validate these findings, the expression of BOLA3-DT was checked in our sample set of 15 PCa (prostate cancer) and 15 BPH (benign hypertrophy of the prostate) patients. RESULTS: In the GDC TCGA PRAD dataset, the expression of the lncRNA BOLA3-DT was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer tissue samples (n = 492) compared to adjacent normal (n = 52; p < 0.0001), and, there was a significant negative correlation between the expression of the lncRNA BOLA3-DT and the serum PSA level (p < 0.01). However, no significant association was found between the lncRNA BOLA3-DT expression and the Gleason score (p > 0.05). In this study, it was found that BOLA3-DT was downregulated in PCa tissue samples compared to BPH samples (p > 0.05). In the GDC TCGA PRAD dataset, it was revealed that BOLA3-DT could serve as an excellent diagnostic marker with a sensitivity of 86.9% and a specificity of 84.6% (AUC-0.916). CONCLUSION: LncRNA BOLA3-DT, a novel long non-coding RNA, was found to be downregulated in prostate cancer. The expression of the lncRNA BOLA3-DT can serve as a diagnostic marker in prostate cancer."
39847876,Association between DNA damage repair alterations and outcomes to (177)Lu-PSMA-617 in advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: (177)Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 (LuPSMA) is a radionuclide therapy approved for patients with PSMA-avid metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We evaluated whether alterations in the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway were associated with outcomes to LuPSMA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified an institutional cohort of men (n = 134) treated with >/=2 cycles of LuPSMA who had panel-based germline and/or tumor genomic sequencing. Mutations or two-copy losses in any of BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDK12, PALB2, RAD51, and MSH2 were considered DDR defects. The primary outcome was a >/=50% reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level during LuPSMA therapy (PSA50); secondary outcomes were PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS). Models were adjusted for age, number of prior systemic therapies, sites of metastasis, and log-transformed PSA at cycle 1. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (25%) harbored DDR alterations, most commonly in BRCA2 and ATM (both n = 13). The presence of a DDR defect was not associated with PSA50 [adjusted odds ratio 0.48 (0.20-1.09), P = 0.08], PSA-PFS [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.29 (0.79-2.10), P = 0.30], or OS [adjusted HR 1.42 (0.74-2.72), P = 0.29], with a non-significant trend toward poorer outcomes among DDR-altered patients. CONCLUSIONS: DDR alterations were not associated with outcomes following LuPSMA. This has implications for treatment sequencing in mCRPC, particularly in patients with DDR alterations."
39847481,CPSF1 inhibition promotes widespread use of intergenic polyadenylation sites and impairs glycolysis in prostate cancer cells.,"Localized prostate cancer can be cured by radiation or surgery, but advanced prostate cancer continues to be a clinical challenge. Altered alternative polyadenylation occurs in numerous cancers and can downregulate tumor-suppressor genes and upregulate oncogenes. We found that the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex factor CPSF1 is upregulated in patients with advanced prostate cancer, with high CPSF1 expression correlating with worse progression-free survival. Knockdown of CPSF1 selectively inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells and reduced glycolytic output. Evaluating the changes in global poly(A) site usage in prostate cancer cells following CPSF1 knockdown revealed widespread usage of intergenic poly(A) sites distal to annotated 3' UTRs, which lengthened 3' UTRs and decreased levels of thousands of mRNAs, including key glycolysis genes. These findings uncover a role for CPSF1 in the suppression of intergenic poly(A) sites in prostate cancer and nominate CPSF1 as a therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer."
39846984,Pembrolizumab +/- paricalcitol in metastatic pancreatic cancer postmaximal cytoreduction.,"LESSONS LEARNED: Intravenous paricalcitol did not improve the efficacy of pembrolizumab, likely related to the short half-life. BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has limited benefit in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with the tumor microenvironment playing a key role in immune resistance. In preclinical studies, vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists have been shown to sensitize pancreatic tumors to PD-1 blockade. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial to evaluate pembrolizumab with or without paricalcitol as maintenance therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Participants were >/=18 years; histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic PDAC showing no disease progression after frontline systemic therapy, and achieving maximal cytoreduction (eg, with no further antitumor effect), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 or 1; adequate organ function. Study treatment included: pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks and either paricalcitol 25 mcg IV 3 times per week or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate 6-month progression free survival (PFS). Secondary objectives include evaluating the toxicity of the combination and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in 6-month PFS, median PFS, median OS, nor treatment-related AEs between the 2 arms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Paricalcitol did not improve the efficacy of pembrolizumab likely related to its short half-life of only 5-7 hours. Microbiome analysis revealed significant difference between long-term (>12 weeks) and short-term (<12 weeks) survival groups across treatment arms. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment will likely require more sustained VDR activity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, ID: NCT03331562."
39846340,"Study on Interaction Between 5-(4 Methoxyphenyl)-1-Phenyl-1H-1,2,3-Triazole with High-Abundant Blood Proteins and Identification of Low-Abundant Proteins by Serum Proteomics.","A comprehensive strategy, including spectroscopic, molecular simulation, proteomics, and bioinformatics techniques, was employed to investigate a novel triazole, 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole, its interactions with high-abundance blood proteins, and identification of low-abundance proteins. The binding constants and thermodynamic parameters of the triazole to two high-abundance blood globular proteins, human serum albumin, and human immunoglobulin G (HIgG), were obtained by spectroscopic techniques and computational chemistry. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to isolate and identify differentially expressed low-abundance proteins in human blood serum samples following exposure to the triazole. The results indicated that there is strong binding of the triazole to human serum albumin/HIgG and hydrophobic interaction plays a main role in the system. There were 21 highly expressed proteins identified from blood serum samples intervened by the triazole. By bioinformatics analysis, one of the differential proteins, kininogen-1 protein, was to explore the mechanism of action of 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole intervention on the kallikrein-kinin signaling pathways related to HeLa cervical cancer cells. The triazole displayed antiproliferative activity and significantly altered a kallikrein-10 expression, suggesting a possible antitumor mechanism involving the kallikrein-kinin system. These research findings provide scientific insights for further development and application of the 1,2,3-triazole compound. The study highlights the potential of the compound as a multifunctional pharmaceutical agent, particularly in cancer therapies, and lays the foundation for its future clinical applications in targeting drug-protein interactions."
39845739,"A Cross-sectional Survey of Physicians to Understand Biomarker Testing and Treatment Patterns in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the USA, EU5, Japan, and China.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Treatment landscape in advanced prostate cancer (PC) is evolving. There is limited understanding of the factors influencing decision-making for genetic/genomic testing and the barriers to recommending testing and treatment in international real-world clinical practice following the approval of poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC). This work aims to assess genetic/genomic testing patterns and methods, including for homologous recombination repair mutation (HRRm), and treatment decisions among physicians caring for patients with PC across the USA, Europe, and Asia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of physicians treating patients with advanced PC was administered in the USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Japan, and China. Physicians were recruited (from August to December 2022) via clinical panels and provided informed consent. Survey questions covered factors influencing HRRm testing and treatment decision-making. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Physicians reported that 50% of patients with mCRPC are recommended for HRRm testing, and among those recommended for testing, 60% are recommended for BRCA1/2 mutation testing and 65% go on to receive HRRm testing. Overall proportions of patients recommended for testing increased following PARPi approval (from 20% to 50%) and following updated practice guidelines (from 25% to 50%). Perceived barriers to the use of genetic/genomic testing included patient refusal, lack of insurance/reimbursement, and lack of availability of adequate tissue for testing. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Overall, testing rates increased following PARPi approval and updated clinical practice guidelines; yet, there was a wide variation in the proportions of patients with mCRPC recommended for testing, and perceived barriers to testing remain, suggesting unmet needs for patients and physicians. PATIENT SUMMARY: We surveyed physicians globally about their experience in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer and genetic testing. Physicians reported that half of patients are recommended for genetic testing, which varied across countries. We conclude that barriers to testing remain for patients and physicians."
39845214,Therapeutic Challenges in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Case Study and Review of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Therapy Failures in Highly Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Avid Disease.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) posing significant treatment challenges. This case report discusses a 65-year-old male with mCRPC who initially responded to hormonal therapy but later showed disease progression despite additional chemotherapy. He subsequently received (177)Lu-PSMA and (225)Ac-PSMA therapies, both of which failed to halt disease progression despite having an intense PSMA avid metastatic disease. This case highlights the complexity of treatment responses in mCRPC, particularly when intense PSMA avidity does not correlate with therapeutic effectiveness. It suggests that underlying genomic alterations may contribute to resistance, highlighting the potential role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in identifying biomarkers that predict treatment outcomes. Further research is necessary to explore these genomics, along with other potential resistance mechanisms, to enhance personalized treatment strategies for patients with mCRPC."
39844192,A novel peptide encoded by circSRCAP confers resistance to enzalutamide by inhibiting the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of AR-V7 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The sustained activation of androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) is a key factor in the resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to second-generation anti-androgens such as enzalutamide (ENZ). The AR/AR-V7 protein is regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 and a complex involving HSP70, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) in ENZ-resistant and control CRPC cells. The coding potential of circSRCAP was confirmed by polysome profiling and LC-MS. The function of circSRCAP was validated in vitro and in vivo using gain- and loss-of-function assays. Mechanistic insights were obtained through immunoprecipitation analyses. RESULTS: A novel ENZ-resistant circRNA, circSRCAP, was identified and shown to be upregulated in ENZ-resistant C4-2B (ENZR-C4-2B) cells, correlating with increased AR-V7 protein levels. circSRCAP is generated via splicing by eIF4A3, forming a loop structure and is exported from the nucleus by the RNA helicase DDX39A. Mechanistically, circSRCAP encodes a 75-amino acid peptide (circSRCAP-75aa) that inhibits the ubiquitination of AR/AR-V7's co-chaperone protein HSP70 by disrupting the interaction with the E3 ligase STUB1. This process results in the upregulation of AR-V7 expression and promotes ENZ resistance in CRPC cells. Xenograft tumor models further confirmed the role of circSRCAP in CRPC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target for ENZ-resistant CRPC. CONCLUSIONS: circSRCAP provides an epigenetic mechanism influencing AR-V7 stability and offers a promising therapeutic target for treating ENZ-resistant CRPC."
39842705,Prostate cancer-selective anticancer action of an oxindole derivative via HO-1-mediated disruption of metabolic reprogramming.,"Prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men, exhibits distinct metabolic reprogramming involving zinc and citrate metabolism. This study investigated whether targeting this unique metabolic profile could offer an effective therapeutic approach. A series of novel oxindole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory effects on transcription factors (TFs) and antiproliferative activity across various cancer cell lines. Among these, compound 3D showed the strongest inhibition of master TFs (HIF-1alpha, c-Myc, and SP-1) and demonstrated selective antiproliferative activity in prostate cancer cells. In PC-3 and LNCaP cells, compound 3D suppressed aerobic glycolysis by downregulating lactate-modulating genes (LDHA, MCT1/4, and CAIX) and the zinc influx transporter (ZIP1), without affecting the zinc efflux transporter (ZnT4). Notably, 3D selectively increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels in prostate cancer cells, as shown by the proteome profiler oncogene array assay and confirmed by Western blotting. This response was reversed by ZnCl(2) treatment. The decreases in LDHA, mitochondrial mass (measured by FACS), and cell proliferation induced by compound 3D were blocked by HO-1-IN-1, an HO-1 inhibitor, and ZnCl(2). Furthermore, 3D induced a more pronounced reduction in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) than in the extracellular acidification rate (EACR), indicating a strong effect on oxidative metabolism. 3D exhibited dose-dependent antitumour efficacy in vivo comparable to that of docetaxel. These findings reveal that the oxindole derivative 3D substantially lowers intracellular zinc levels, yielding potent antitumour effects in prostate cancer through HO-1 upregulation, which impairs mitochondrial function more significantly than aerobic glycolysis."
39842564,Mitochondrial oxidative stress related LncRNA predict cervical cancer prognosis and immunotherapy response: Molecular structure and protein interaction of ribosomal protein L34.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of mitochondrial oxidative stress-related LncRNA in cancer prognosis and immunotherapy response, and to further analyze the molecular structure of ribosomal protein L34 and its interaction mechanism with the protein. We screened lncrnas associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress, evaluated their expression patterns in different cancer types, and analyzed the three-dimensional structure of ribosomal protein L34 and its interaction network with other proteins. In this study, public databases were used to screen out lncrnas associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress. Bioinformatic analysis, including gene expression profile analysis, survival analysis and functional enrichment analysis, was used to evaluate the expression patterns of these lncrnas in different cancer types and their relationship with prognosis. The interacting proteins of ribosomal protein L34 were identified by proteomic techniques. The three-dimensional structure of ribosomal protein L34 and its binding mode with interacting proteins were studied by molecular docking and dynamic simulation methods. The results showed that the screened lncrnas showed significant expression differences in multiple cancer types and were closely related to the survival rate of patients. The three-dimensional structure of ribosomal protein L34 reveals key amino acid residues and binding sites for its interactions with specific proteins. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these lncrnas may affect the development of cancer through regulating oxidative stress response, cell cycle and apoptosis. The interaction network of ribosomal protein L34 reveals its central role in protein synthesis and cellular stress response."
39840708,"Exploring Cervical Adenocarcinoma: Epidemiological Insights, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges, and Pathogenetic Mechanisms.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer poses a significant threat to women's health and encompasses various histological types, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), cervical adenocarcinoma (CA), and adenosquamous carcinoma. CA, in particular, presents a formidable challenge in clinical management due to its low early detection rate, pronounced aggressiveness, high recurrence rate, and mortality, compounded by the complexities associated with late-stage treatment. There is limited understanding of the similarities and differences in the pathogenesis mechanisms between CA and SCC, such as tumor heterogeneity and the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). METHODS: A literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using the following research terms: ""gynecological oncology,"" ""cervical cancer,"" ""cervical adenocarcinoma,"" ""epidemiology,"" ""diagnosis and treatment of cervical adenocarcinoma,"" ""Human papillomavirus,"" ""World Health Organization,"" ""tumor microenvironment,"" ""single-cell RNA sequencing,"" ""molecular mechanism,"" and ""preclinical research model."" CONCLUSION: This review consolidates the epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic and therapeutic hurdles, and the latest advances in research on CA. It aims to highlight the significant heterogeneity of the TME characteristics exhibited by CA compared to SCC. Additionally, we also summarize the common preclinical models for CA and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using various models in research. We aspire that the discussions presented herein will offer novel insights and directions for subsequent research, as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies for CA."
39840054,Single-cell RNA sequencing and immune microenvironment analysis reveal PLOD2-driven malignant transformation in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally, and the main cause of the disease has been found to be ongoing HPV infection. Cervical cancer remains the primary cause of cancer-related death despite major improvements in screening and treatment approaches, especially in low- and middle-income nations. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the tumor microenvironment in advanced cervical cancer in order to identify possible treatment targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to better understand malignant cervical cancer epithelial cells (EPCs), this study used bulk RNA-seq data from UCSC in conjunction with single-cell RNA sequencing data from the ArrayExpress database. After putting quality control procedures into place, cell type identification and clustering analysis using the Seurat software were carried out. To clarify functional pathways, enrichment analysis and differential gene expression were carried out. The CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE R packages were used to evaluate the immune microenvironment characteristics, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to extract prognostic features. Furthermore, assessments of drug sensitivity and functional enrichment were carried out. RESULTS: Eight cell types were identified, with EPCs showing high proliferative and stemness features. Five EPC subpopulations were defined, with C1 NNMT+ CAEPCs driving tumor differentiation. A NNMT CAEPCs Risk Score (NCRS) model was developed, revealing a correlation between elevated NCRS scores and adverse patient outcomes characterized by immune evasion. In vitro experiments validated that the prognostic gene PLOD2 significantly enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells. CONCLUSION: This investigation delineated eight cell types and five subpopulations of malignant EPCs in cervical cancer, establishing the C1 NNMT+ CAEPCs as a crucial therapeutic target. The NCRS model demonstrated its prognostic capability, indicating that higher scores are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The validation of PLOD2 as a prognostic gene highlights its therapeutic potential, underscoring the critical need for integrating immunotherapy and targeted treatment strategies to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in cervical cancer."
39838347,Resolution of oncogene-induced senescence markers in HPV-infected cervical cancer tissue.,"BACKGROUND: Oncogene-Induced Senescence (OIS) is a form of senescence that occurs as a consequence of oncogenic overstimulation and possibly infection by oncogenic viruses. Whether senescence plays a role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer (CC) is not well understood. Moreover, whether cervical epithelial cells that are part of the premalignant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), exhibit markers of OIS in Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-infected tissue, has not been investigated. METHODS: We utilized a set of patient-derived premalignant and malignant tissue samples to investigate the protein (Ki67 and Lamin B1) and gene (TP53, IL1A, CCL2, and MMP9) expression of several OIS-associated biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qRT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, we characterized the HPV status of all tissue samples. RESULTS: Most of the CC samples (34/37) were positive for HPV, mainly HPV-16 which was observed in 62.2% of the CC samples. Among CINs, HPV infection was found in 60.2% of the 32 samples with HPV-16 as the dominant genotype in 58.5% of the CINs. IHC analysis revealed a significant increase in the expression levels of both Ki67 and Lamin B1 proteins in CC tissue compared to CIN. On average, 93% of tumor cells were positive for Ki67 in comparison to only 25% of premalignant cells in CIN samples. Similarly, Lamin B1 expression was observed in 89% of tumor cells in malignant tissue on average, compared to 60% in CIN samples. Importantly, Lamin B1 expression was elevated in nonmalignant cervical tissue suggesting that its downregulation is more predominant in the premalignant state. Furthermore, RT-PCR revealed a significant decrease in the expression of TP53, IL1a, CCL2, and MMP9 markers in CC samples compared to CINs. Specifically, 84% of CC samples showed reduced TP53 expression, 90% showed reduced IL1a expression, 74% showed reduced CCL2 expression, and 76% showed reduced MMP9 expression when compared with their premalignant baseline. Infection of HPV was confirmed in 61% of the tumor tissues while only 25% of the CINs were positive for HPV. CONCLUSION: This work shall provide an opportunity to further examine the role of OIS in the process of HPV-driven CC development."
39837949,Exploring the protective role of caffeine against Taraxacum-Induced ribotoxic stress mediated through autophagy and mitochondrial depolarization.,"The ribotoxic stress response is a pathway that gets activated when ribosomes get impaired, leading to disruptions in protein synthesis, increased inflammatory signaling, and cell death if left unresolved. Taraxacum can induce apoptosis-associated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) cleavage, however, the exact working mechanism of Taraxacum-induced rRNA cleavage remains unclear. In this study, we used the RNA integrity (RIN) value and 28S/18S ratio to confirm the integrity of experiments. Our RNA sequencing data showed that Taraxacum formosanum (T. formosanum) upregulated 893 genes and downregulated 509 genes and triggered hallmark genes of spliceosomes, TNF-alpha signaling via NF-kappaB, inflammatory response, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Additionally, T. formosanum imbalanced the levels of ribosomal proteins of the large and small subunits. We found that caffeine was the only screening agent that could rescue the cleavage of 28S and 18S rRNA induced by T. formosanum. However, caffeine failed to rescue T. formosanum-targeted mRNAs when the RIN values were relatively lower. T. formosanum induced the N-terminal clipping of histone H3, which was observed not only in human HeLa cervical cancer cells but also in human Huh6 and HepG2 liver cancer cells. Our study revealed that caffeine could reverse the effects of T. formosanum on the reduction of autophagy and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. However, caffeine could only change the populations of necrotic and apoptotic cells but not T. formosanum-induced cell death. By providing detailed information on Taraxacum-induced rRNA cleavage and N-truncated histone H3's mechanisms of gene regulation, we hope to understand their respective cellular death and survival stresses."
39837010,Phthalate exposure induces microRNA-5010/Nrf2-EGR1/GDF15 signaling expression in prostate cancer.,"Phthalate exposure is linked to prostate enlargement through sex hormonal changes and oxidative stress. However, its role and action mechanism in prostate cancer remain unclear. This study examined two patient cohorts: 204 patients undergoing prostate biopsy (24 benign and 180 malignancies) and 85 with confirmed prostate cancer receiving robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Urine samples, collected with informed consent, were analyzed for urinary DEHP metabolites using HPLC-MS and ELISA. Patients with prostate cancer exhibited significantly higher urinary MEOHP and SigmaDEHP metabolite levels than those who underwent benign biopsy (unpaired t-test, p = 0.027 and 0.039, respectively). MIR-5010 upregulation and MIR-205 downregulation were observed in two paired small RNA sequencing analyses (urine pellets of benign vs. malignant patients and PC3 cells without or with DEHP treatment), correlating with tumor staging in the TCGA prostate cancer cohort. Unlike MIR-205, a known tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that higher MIR-5010 expression was linked to increased Nrf-2 downstream signaling (enriched score: 0.35; p = 0.17). In vitro assays in prostate cancer cells showed that DEHP enhanced Nrf-2 protein expression and its downstream signaling molecules (i.e., SOD2, Heme oxygenase-1, and EGR-1) while increasing GDF15 mRNA expression via EGR-1 regulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, urinary GDF15 levels were positively associated with urinary MEOHP and MEHP metabolites in the biopsy cohort (p = 0.0007 and 0.011, respectively) and with urinary oxidative stress marker 8-OHdG, aggressive marker VEGF, and CCL2/MCP-1 levels in the prostatectomy cohort (p = 0.0004, 0.006, and 0.0034, respectively). These findings suggest that phthalate exposure induces Nrf-2 and its downstream signaling (i.e., EGR-1/GDF-15) through microRNA regulation, contributing to prostate cancer aggressiveness."
39836322,"Rare cancer survivorship research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 2017 to 2023.","PURPOSE: Rare cancers are defined as those for which there are less than 15 cases per 100,000 in the population annually. While much progress in detection and treatment has been made over the past decade for many rare cancers, less progress has been made in understanding survivorship needs. The objective of this study was to characterize the National Institutes of Health (NIH) cancer survivorship grant portfolio focused on rare cancers and to identify gaps specific to this area of science. METHODS: Newly awarded grants focused on rare cancers in the NIH cancer survivorship research portfolio from Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 to FY2023 were identified. Grant characteristics were abstracted and described. In addition, the number of grants for each rare cancer type was mapped to current Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program incidence and relative survival rates. RESULTS: A total of 93 survivorship grants focused on one or multiple rare cancer types were funded from FY2017 to FY2023. Approximately 85% of these grants investigated one of four cancer types: leukemia, head & neck, ovarian and brain. Few grants focused on other rare cancer types, such as multiple myeloma (n = 5), testicular cancer (n = 3), rectal cancer (n = 1), thyroid cancer (n = 1), and cervical cancer (n = 0). About half of the grants (50.5%) were observational studies; 34.4% focused explicitly on pediatric cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Survivorship research for many rare cancer types is limited. This paucity of research is a barrier to the identification of survivorship needs and the development of interventions to address these needs."
39834542,Exploring the prognostic significance of lactate-mitochondria-related genes in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common and serious health issue among older men globally. Metabolic reprogramming, particularly involving lactate and mitochondria, plays a key role in PCa progression, but studies linking these factors to prognosis are limited. To identify novel prognostic markers of PCa based on lactate-mitochondria-related genes (LMRGs), RNA sequencing data and clinical information of PCa from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the cBioPortal database were used to construct a lactate-mitochondria-related risk signature. Here, we established a novel nine-LMRG risk signature for PCa, and Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed a worse prognosis for high-risk subgroups in the TCGA dataset. Meanwhile, a nomogram that effectively predicts the prognosis of PCa patients was also constructed. Next, close associations between the lactate-mitochondria-related signature and the immune microenvironment were examined to clarify the role of LMRGs in shaping the immune landscape. Furthermore, as the only lactate-related gene among the nine key prognostic risk genes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) was identified as a key factor that mediates lactate production in vitro and in vivo through attenuation of the glycolytic pathway. More importantly, MPO significantly inhibited PCa cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), indicating its potential as an anticancer gene. Additionally, PCa with high MPO expression is highly sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents and mitochondrial inhibitors, highlighting its potential as an improved therapeutic strategy for PCa management."

Its high specificity and low off-target effects make it exceptionally effective in applications involving Human Papillomavirus (HPV) related diseases, most notably cervical cancer. This approach offers a refined methodology for the rapid detection of viral infections and provides a robust platform for the safe and effective treatment of diseases associated with viral infections through gene therapy.Purpose: Gene therapy, within this context, involves the strategic delivery of genetic material into target cells via a vector. This is followed by the meticulous modulation of gene expression, whether through correction, addition, or suppression, specifically honed to target tumor cells while sparing healthy cells. This dual capacity to diagnose and treat at such a precise level underscores the transformative potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in contemporary medical science, particularly in oncology and virology.Research Design: This article provides an overview of the advancements made in utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a research tool for HPV-related treatments while summarizing its application status in basic research, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV.Data Collection: Furthermore, it discusses the future prospects for this technology within emerging areas of HPV research and precision medicine in clinical practice, while highlighting technical challenges and potential directions for future development."
39832373,Impact of Genomic Classifiers on Risk Stratification and Treatment Intensity in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer : A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Tissue-based genomic classifiers (GCs) have been developed to improve prostate cancer (PCa) risk assessment and treatment recommendations. PURPOSE: To summarize the impact of the Decipher, Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS), and Prolaris GCs on risk stratification and patient-clinician decisions on treatment choice among patients with localized PCa considering first-line treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science published from January 2010 to August 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently identified studies on risk classification and treatment choice after GC testing for patients with localized PCa considering first-line treatment. DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data extracted by 1 researcher and overread by a second. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed in duplicate. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ten studies reported risk reclassification after GC testing. In low ROB observational studies, very low- or low-risk patients with PCa were more likely to have their risk levels classified as the same or lower (GPS, 100% to 88.1%; Decipher, 87.2% to 82.9%; Prolaris, 76.9%). However, 1 randomized trial found that GC testing with GPS reclassified 34.5% of very low-risk and 29.4% of low-risk patients to a higher risk category. Twelve observational studies indicated that treatment decisions after GC testing either remained unchanged or slightly favored active surveillance. In contrast, analyses from a single randomized trial found fewer choices for active surveillance after GPS testing. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity in screening patterns, risk-determination cutoffs, pathology, and clinical practices. Studies on treatment choice were moderate to high ROB. CONCLUSION: Although GC tests do not consistently influence risk classification or treatment decisions, the differences observed between observational and randomized studies highlight a need for well-designed trials to explore the role of GC tests in patients with newly diagnosed PCa considering first-line treatment.

39831355,Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals the Cellular Origin and Evolution of Small-Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Cervix.,"Small-cell neuroendocrine cancer (SCNEC) of the uterine cervix is an exceedingly rare, highly aggressive tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. The cellular heterogeneity, origin, and tumorigenesis trajectories of SCNEC of the cervix remain largely unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing on tumor tissues and adjacent normal cervical tissues from two patients diagnosed with SCNEC of the cervix. Here, we provide the first comprehensive insights into the cellular composition, HPV infection-related features, and gene expression profiles of SCNEC of the cervix at single-cell resolution. Correlation analyses suggested that SCNEC of the cervix may originate from squamous epithelial cells, and this observation was validated with bulk RNA-seq data from external cervical neuroendocrine cancer. Furthermore, sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), a key transcription factor that functions in direct neural differentiation, was located in the copy number gain region and highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumor cells from both patients. Notable, the distributions of the HPV-infected epithelium and SOX2 highly expressed epithelium were consistent with each other. Therefore, we supposed that high-risk HPV infection and amplification of SOX2 in the squamous epithelium may contribute to the progression of small-cell neuroendocrine tumorigenesis in the cervix."
39830266,"Serum, Cell-Free, HPV-Human DNA Junction Detection and HPV Typing for Predicting and Monitoring Cervical Cancer Recurrence.","Almost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). In most cases, HPV DNA is integrated into the human genome. We found that tumor-specific, HPV-human DNA junctions are detectable in serum cell-free DNA of a fraction of cervical cancer patients at the time of initial treatment and/or at six months following treatment. Retrospective analysis revealed these junctions were more frequently detectable in women in whom the cancer later recurred. We also found that cervical cancers caused by HPV types outside of phylogenetic clade alpha9 had a higher recurrence frequency than those caused by alpha9 types in both our study and The Cancer Genome Atlas cervical cancer database, despite the higher prevalence of alpha9 types including HPV16 in cervical cancer. Thus, HPV-human DNA junction detection in serum cell-free DNA and HPV type determination in tumor tissue may help predict recurrence risk. Screening serum cell-free DNA for junctions may also offer an unambiguous, non-invasive means to monitor absence of recurrence following treatment."
39830250,The Association between Proteomic Aging Clocks and the Risk of Cancer in Midlife Individuals.,"BACKGROUND: To measure the aging process before a cancer diagnosis, we developed the first cancer-specific proteomic aging clock (CaPAC) and examined its association with cancer risk in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) studies. METHODS: Using the SomaScan assay, ARIC measured 4,712 proteins in plasma samples collected in 1990-92 from 3,347 participants who developed cancer over follow-up until 2015 and 7,487 who remained cancer-free, all aged 46-70. We constructed CaPAC0 using elastic net regression among two-thirds randomly selected cancer-free participants (N=4,991, training set) and calculated age acceleration for CaPAC0 (CaPAA0) as residuals of CaPAC0 on chronological age in all remaining ARIC participants. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of overall, obesity-related, smoking-related, and the most common cancers (prostate, lung, breast, colorectal) with CaPAA0 using a case-cohort design. We replicated the analysis in 3,893 MESA participants aged 46-70 at Exam 1 (456 incident cancer). RESULTS: CaPAC0 was correlated with chronological age in ARIC and MESA (r=0.82 and 0.86, respectively). In both ARIC and MESA, CaPAA0 was significantly (p<0.05) associated with the risk of overall [HRs per 5-years=1.08 and 1.23, respectively], smoking-related [HRs=1.30 and 1.54, respectively], and lung cancers [HRs=1.54 and 1.94, respectively]. CaPAA0 was also significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk in ARIC [HR=1.31], but not in MESA. CaPAA0 was not associated with obesity-related, breast, or prostate cancers. CONCLUSION: CaPAA0 was associated with several types of cancer with the strongest association observed for lung cancer risk."
39827882,Mammalian nucleophagy: process and function.,"The nucleus is a highly specialized organelle that houses the cell's genetic material and regulates key cellular activities, including growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell division. Its structure and function are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms to ensure cellular integrity and genomic stability. Increasing evidence suggests that nucleophagy, a selective form of autophagy that targets nuclear components, plays a critical role in preserving nuclear integrity by clearing dysfunctional nuclear materials such as nuclear proteins (lamins, SIRT1, and histones), DNA-protein crosslinks, micronuclei, and chromatin fragments. Impaired nucleophagy has been implicated in aging and various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegeneration, autoimmune disorders, and neurological injury. In this review, we focus on nucleophagy in mammalian cells, discussing its mechanisms, regulation, and cargo selection, as well as evaluating its therapeutic potential in promoting human health and mitigating disease.Abbreviations: 5-FU: 5-fluorouracil; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG, autophagy related; CMA, chaperone-mediated autophagy; DRPLA: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ESCRT: endosomal sorting complex required for transport; HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MEFs: mouse embryonic fibroblasts; mRNA: messenger RNA; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; PCa: prostate cancer; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PtdIns3K: class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PtdIns3P: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; rRNA: ribosomal RNA; SCI: spinal cord injury; SCLC: small cell lung cancer; SNARE: soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SupraT: supraphysiological levels of testosterone; TOP1cc: TOP1 cleavage complexes."
39825869,BRCA Mutation Testing in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Practical Guidance for Australian Clinical Practice.,"Some patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) possess germline or acquired defects in the DNA damage repair (DDR) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Tumors with BRCA mutations exhibit sensitivity to poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) such as olaparib and rucaparib. As a result, molecular diagnostic testing to identify patients with BRCA mutations eligible for the PARPi therapy has become an integral component of managing patients with mCRPC. There are practical challenges in the current molecular testing pathway in Australia that can compromise testing success. Testing success is often contingent on quality of tissue handling and laboratory processing techniques to minimize DNA degradation and suboptimal sequencing data quality. Greater adoption of best testing practices in Australia can be facilitated with education and greater awareness of expert recommendations. Here, we provide expert recommendations on how to optimize BRCA molecular diagnostic testing in patients with mCRPC. Optimization and standardization of molecular diagnostic testing will support health care providers and institutes in establishing more efficient testing pathways, enabling access to targeted therapies such as PARPi, and improving patient outcomes."
39825401,"Meta-analyses of mouse and human prostate single-cell transcriptomes reveal widespread epithelial plasticity in tissue regression, regeneration, and cancer.","BACKGROUND: Despite extensive analysis, the dynamic changes in prostate epithelial cell states during tissue homeostasis as well as tumor initiation and progression have been poorly characterized. However, recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have greatly facilitated studies of cell states and plasticity in tissue maintenance and cancer, including in the prostate. METHODS: We have performed meta-analyses of new and previously published scRNA-seq datasets for mouse and human prostate tissues to identify and compare cell populations across datasets in a uniform manner. Using random matrix theory to denoise datasets, we have established reference cell type classifications for the normal mouse and human prostate and have used optimal transport to compare the cross-species transcriptomic similarities of epithelial cell populations. In addition, we have integrated analyses of single-cell transcriptomic states with copy number variants to elucidate transcriptional programs in epithelial cells during human prostate cancer progression. RESULTS: Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles toward a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and gland regeneration. In the human prostate, we find substantial rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-naive prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within luminal acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that luminal acinar tumor cells in treatment-naive prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between AR-positive and AR-low profiles with similarity to PrU-like states. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our analyses of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity provide important translational insights into the origin and treatment response of prostate cancer. In particular, the identification of AR-low tumor populations suggests that castration-resistance and predisposition to neuroendocrine differentiation may be pre-existing properties in treatment-naive primary tumors that are selected for by androgen-deprivation therapies."
39823710,Vitamin D-related genetic variants and prostate cancer risk in Black men.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer has primarily been characterized among White men. Black men, however, have higher prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, chronically low circulating vitamin D levels, and ancestry-specific genetic variants in vitamin D-related genes. Here, we examine critical genes in the vitamin D pathway and prostate cancer risk in Black men. METHODS: We assessed a total of 73 candidate variants in genes (namely GC, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and RXRA) including functional variants previously associated with prostate cancer and circulating 25(OHD) in White men. Associations with prostate cancer risk were examined using genome-wide association study data for approximately 10,000 prostate cancer cases and 10,000 controls among Black men and over 85,000 cases and 91,000 controls among White men for comparison. A statistical significance threshold of 0.000685 was used to account for the 73 variants tested. RESULTS: None of the variants examined were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk among Black men after multiple comparison adjustment. Suggestive associations (P < 0.05) for four variants were found in Black men, including two in RXRA (rs41400444 OR=1.09, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.17, P = 0.024 and rs10881574 OR = 0.93, 0.87-1.00, P = 0.046) and two in VDR (rs2853563 OR = 1.07, 1.01-1.13, P = 0.017 and rs1156882 OR = 1.06, 1.00-1.12, P = 0.045). Two variants in VDR were also positively associated with risk in White men (rs11568820 OR = 1.04, 1.02-1.06, P = 0.00024 and rs4516035 OR = 1.03, 1.01-1.04, P = 0.00055). CONCLUSION: We observed suggestive associations between genetic variants in RXRA and VDR and prostate cancer risk in Black men. Future research exploring the relationship of vitamin D with cancer risk in Black men will need larger sample sizes to identify ancestry-specific variants relevant to risk in this population."
39821470,Role of long non-coding RNAs and natural products in prostate cancer: insights into key signaling pathways.,"Prostate cancer (PC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers in males. Recent studies have highlighted intricate connections between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), natural products, and cellular signaling in PC development. LncRNAs, which are RNA transcripts without protein-coding function, influence cell growth, programmed cell death, metastasis, and resistance to treatments through pathways like PI3K/AKT, WNT/beta-catenin, and androgen receptor signaling. Certain lncRNAs, including HOTAIR and PCA3, are associated with PC progression, with potential as diagnostic markers. Natural compounds, such as curcumin and resveratrol, demonstrate anticancer effects by targeting these pathways, reducing tumor growth, and modulating lncRNA expression. For instance, curcumin suppresses HOTAIR levels, hindering PC cell proliferation and invasion. The interaction between lncRNAs and natural compounds may open new avenues for therapy, as these substances can simultaneously impact multiple signaling pathways. These complex interactions offer promising directions for developing innovative PC treatments, enhancing diagnostics, and identifying new biomarkers for improved prevention and targeted therapy. This review aims to map the multifaceted relationship among natural products, lncRNAs, and signaling pathways in PC pathogenesis, focusing on key pathways such as AR, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, WNT/beta-catenin, and MAPK, which are crucial in PC progression and therapy resistance. Regulation of these pathways by natural products and lncRNAs could lead to new insights into biomarker identification, preventive measures, and targeted PC therapies."
39816560,Association of branched-chain amino acids and risk of three urologic cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple studies suggest a plausible connection between urologic cancers and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) breakdown metabolic enzymes. Nevertheless, there is scarce exploration into the variations in circulating BCAAs. In our research, we utilize bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to predict the link between BCAAs levels and three distinct types of urological tumors. METHODS: The study examined data from the UK Biobank, including a comprehensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) of total BCAAs, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, alongside three urological system tumors [prostate cancer (PCa), kidney cancer, and bladder cancer] sourced from the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MRC-IEU) and FinnGen Consortium databases. The primary analytical approach involved the use of the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, complemented by MR-PRESSO global testing and MR-Egger regression to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran Q test. RESULTS: The levels of circulating total BCAAs [odds ratio (OR) =1.002688, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000, 1.005, P=0.03], leucine (OR =1.0038, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.007, P=0.008), isoleucine (OR =1.003352, 95% CI: 1.000, 1.007, P=0.04), and valine (OR =1.00279, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.005, P=0.009) showed positive associations with PCa risk. However, there was inadequate evidence to establish a link between BCAAs and bladder or kidney cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, an association existed between elevated levels of circulating total BCAAs, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and an increased risk of PCa. However, no correlation was detected between BCAAs and kidney or bladder cancer."
39816557,Percentage of fat in milk consumption and risk of six cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: The causal relationship between percentage of fat in milk consumption and cancer risk lacks sufficient investigation. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the percentage of fat in milk consumption is a factor that affects the risk variation of several common types of cancer. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to estimate the unconfounded causal relationship between the percentage of fat in milk consumption and the risk of six cancers related to milk intake, as well as to assess the associations between body fat percentage and these cancers. Data corresponding to the percentage of fat in milk consumption (n=411,503), body fat percentage (n=401,772), breast cancer (n=139,274), ovarian cancer (n=66,450), endometrial cancer (n=121,885), colorectal cancer (n=32,072), prostate cancer (n=140,254), and bladder cancer (n=373,295) were obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) or the genome-wide association study (GWAS) Catalog databases. The primary analytical strategy employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. Sensitivity analysis, including assessments of heterogeneity and pleiotropy, was conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: The percentage of fat in milk consumption only exhibited a causal relationship with breast cancer (beta=2.993, P=0.01). The study identified significant causal effects of body fat percentage on the risk of several cancers, including ovarian cancer (beta=0.225, P=0.002), endometrial cancer (beta=0.669, P<0.001), and colorectal cancer (beta=0.344, P<0.001), as well as a protective effect on prostate cancer (beta=-0.104, P=0.046). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the findings were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings indicated that a higher percentage of fat in milk consumption was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, providing valuable insights for cancer prevention strategies among the European population."
39816554,KIF18A and CDK1 as combined therapeutic targets in cervical and endometrial carcinomas: based on bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Chromosomal instability (CIN) has been identified as a factor that increases the susceptibility of tumor cells to kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A) inhibitors. Limited research exists on genes that are associated with sensitization to KIF18A inhibitors (KIF18Ais). Our study aimed to identify a gene linked to heightened sensitivity to KIF18Ais in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and X2K Appyter databases were used to analyze potential kinases associated with KIF18A-related genes in CESC and UCEC. In vitro assessments, such as Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell, and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays, were performed to evaluate the combined effects of KIF18A and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 inhibitors (CDK1is) in CESC and UCEC cell lines. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that the combination of KIF18A with kinases may potentially augment the efficacy of KIF18Ais, given its close involvement in cell cycle and chromosome segregation. Through bioinformatics analysis, we observed a significant up-regulation of CDK1 expression in CESC and UCEC, which exhibited a strong correlation with KIF18A expression. Our hypothesis regarding the potential of CDK1 as a combination therapeutic target for KIF18A was supported by our cell experiments, which demonstrated that inhibition of CDK1 notably increased the sensitivity of CESC and UCEC cells to KIF18Ais. The combined use of CDK1is and KIF18Ais exhibited a synergistic effect in inhibiting cell migration and inducing apoptosis in CESC and UCEC cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that targeting both KIF18A and CDK1 exerts synergistic anti-tumor effects in CESC and UCEC via inhibiting cell proliferation and migration and inducing apoptosis, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for these cancers."
39816079,Promising candidate drug target genes for repurposing in cervical cancer: A bioinformatics-based approach.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally, and studies have shown that genetic variants play a significant role in its development. A variety of germline and somatic mutations are associated with cervical cancer. However, genomic data derived from these mutations have not been extensively utilized for the development of repurposed drugs for cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to identify novel potential drugs that could be repurposed for cervical cancer treatment through a bioinformatics approach. A comprehensive genomic and bioinformatics database integration strategy was employed to identify potential drug target genes for cervical cancer. Using the GWAS and PheWAS databases, a total of 232 genes associated with cervical cancer were identified. These pharmacological target genes were further refined by applying a biological threshold of six functional annotations. The drug target genes were then cross-referenced with cancer treatment candidates using the DrugBank database. Among the identified genes, LTA, TNFRSF1A, PRKCZ, PDE4B, and PARP were highlighted as promising targets for repurposed drugs. Notably, these five target genes overlapped with 12 drugs that could potentially be repurposed for cervical cancer treatment. Among these, talazoparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, emerged as a particularly promising candidate. Interestingly, talazoparib is currently being investigated for safety and tolerability in other cancers but has not yet been studied in the context of cervical cancer. Further clinical trials are necessary to validate this finding and explore its potential as a repurposed drug for cervical cancer."
39814835,Elucidating the role of pyrimidine metabolism in prostate cancer and its therapeutic implications.,"Our study aims to investigate the role of pyrimidine metabolism in prostate cancer and its associations with the immune microenvironment, drug sensitivity, and tumor mutation burden. Through transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we explored metabolic pathway enrichment, immune infiltration patterns, and differential gene expression in prostate cancer samples. The results showed that pyrimidine metabolism-related genes were significantly upregulated in the P2 subgroup compared to the P1 subgroup, with enhanced metabolic activity observed in basal and luminal epithelial cells. In addition, immune infiltration analysis revealed a strong correlation between pyrimidine metabolism and immune cell regulation, particularly involving T cell activity. Tumors in the P2 subgroup, characterized by higher pyrimidine metabolism, exhibited greater infiltration of activated CD4 + T cells and M2 macrophages, indicating a potential link between metabolic reprogramming and the immune response in prostate cancer. Drug sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that tumors with elevated pyrimidine metabolism displayed increased responsiveness to several chemotherapeutic agents, including BI-2536, JW-7-24-1, and PAC-1, suggesting that targeting pyrimidine metabolism may enhance treatment efficacy. Moreover, key genes involved in pyrimidine de novo synthesis, such as RRM2, were identified as potential drivers of tumor progression, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. In conclusion, pyrimidine metabolism plays a critical role in prostate cancer progression, influencing immune infiltration and drug sensitivity. Targeting this metabolic pathway offers a promising strategy for the development of new therapeutic approaches, particularly for overcoming drug resistance and improving outcomes in patients with advanced prostate cancer."
39812346,Transcriptomic and functional characterization of megakaryocytic-derived platelet-like particles: impaired aggregation and prominent anti-tumor effects.,"Platelet-like particles (PLPs), derived from megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01 and K-562, are widely used as a surrogate to study platelet formation and function. We demonstrate by RNA-Seq that PLPs are transcriptionally distinct from platelets. Expression of key genes in signaling pathways promoting platelet activation/aggregation, such as the PI3K/AKT, protein kinase A, phospholipase C, and alpha-adrenergic and GP6 receptor pathways, was missing or under-expressed in PLPs. Functionally, PLPs do not aggregate following epinephrine, collagen, or ADP stimulation. While PLPs aggregated in response to thrombin, they did not display enhanced expression of surface markers P-selectin and activated alpha(2b)beta(3), in contrast to platelets. We have previously demonstrated that platelets physically couple to MDA-PCa-2b and RC77T/E prostate cancer (PCa) cells via specific ligand-receptor interactions, leading to platelet-stimulated cell invasiveness and apoptotic resistance, and reciprocal cell-induced platelet aggregation. In contrast, PLP interactions with PCa cells inhibited both cell invasion and apoptotic resistance while failing to promote PLP aggregation. Moreover, PLPs reduced platelet-PCa cell interactions and antagonized platelet-stimulated oncogenic effects in PCa cells. RNA-Seq analysis identified candidate ligand-transmembrane protein combinations involved in anti-tumorigenic signaling of PLPs to PCa cells. Antibody neutralization of the TIMP3-MMP15 and VEGFB-FGFR1 signaling axes reversed PLP-mediated anti-invasion and apoptotic sensitization, respectively. In summary, PLPs lack many transcriptomic, molecular and functional features of platelets and possess novel anti-tumorigenic properties. These findings indicate that PLPs may have a potential therapeutic role in targeting and disrupting the oncogenic signaling between platelets and cancer cells, offering a new avenue for anti-cancer strategies."
39812059,TSPOAP1-AS1: A Novel Biomarker for the Prognosis and Therapeutic Target in Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: TSPOAP1 antisense RNA 1 (TSPOAP1-AS1) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has received widespread attention in oncology research in recent years. Its role and mechanism in some cancers have gradually been revealed. However, it is not clear what role TSPOAP1-AS1 plays in cervical cancer (CESC). OBJECTIVE: In this study, bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation were carried out to investigate the relationship between TSPOAP1-AS1 and CESC. METHODS: The relationships between clinical characteristics in patients with CESC, TSPOAP1-AS1 expression, prognostic factors, regulation network, and immune infiltration of TSPOAP1-AS1 were evaluated using statistics and The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR was used to test TSPOAP1-AS1, miR-17-5p, and AGFG2 expression in CESC cell lines. RESULTS: CESC patients exhibited markedly reduced expression of TSPOAP1-AS1. There was a significant correlation between low expression of TSPOAP1-AS1 in CESC patients and the clinical stage (p < 0.05), weight (p < 0.05), and BMI (p < 0.05). Lower expression of TSPOAP1-AS1 in patients with CESC was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.014) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (p = 0.030). There was also an independent correlation between high expression of TSPOAP1- AS1 (p = 0.036) and DSS in patients with CESC. TSPOAP1-AS1 was involved in the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), the chemokine signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and primary immunodeficiencies. The infiltration of immune cells and the expression of TSPOAP1-AS1 were found to be correlated. A ceRNA network of TSPOAP1-AS1/miR-17-5p/AGFG2 was constructed in CESC. In CESC, a ceRNA network involving TSPOAP1-AS1/miR-17-5p/AGFG2 was successfully established. When comparing CESC cell lines with HcerEpic, the expression of TSPOAP1-AS1 and AGFG2 decreased significantly, and the expression of miR-17-5p increased significantly. CONCLUSION: In CESC patients, low expression of TSPOAP1-AS1 was associated with poor survival and immune infiltration. It may be effective to use TSPOAP1-AS1 as a biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic target in CESC."
39810899,Precision medicine in gynecological cancer (Review).,"The advent of personalized and precision medicine has revolutionized oncology and treatment of gynecological cancer. These innovative approaches tailor treatments to individual patient profiles beyond genetic markers considering environmental and lifestyle factors, thereby optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. Precision medicine uses advanced genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing to perform comprehensive tumor profiling. This allows identification of distinct genetic mutations, expression patterns and signaling pathway alterations, revealing the complex molecular landscape of gynecological cancer such as ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer. A major challenge in treating these cancers is their inherent molecular heterogeneity, which can influence tumor behavior, therapy response and prognosis. Precision medicine aims to overcome this by identifying biomarkers and molecular drivers for targeted therapy selection. For example, the identification of breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutations in ovarian cancer has guided the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, leading to more effective treatments with fewer side effects. Similar targeted therapies and immunotherapies have also been developed for cervical and uterine cancer, marking progress toward personalized care. Future directions in gynecological oncology emphasize the importance of molecular profiling and development of targeted therapies. By understanding the unique molecular features of each patient, clinicians can select the most effective personalized treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes and quality of life."
39810624,Single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis reveal a distinct population of APOE(-) cells yielding pathological lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine tumors worldwide, especially among women and the metastatic mechanism of papillary thyroid carcinoma remains poorly understood. METHODS: Thyroid cancer tissue samples were obtained for single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, aiming to intratumoral and antimetastatic heterogeneity of advanced PTC. The functions of APOE in PTC cell proliferation and invasion were confirmed through in vivo and in vitro assays. Pseudotime analysis and CellChat were performed to explore the the molecular mechanisms of the APOE in PTC progression. RESULTS: We identified a subpopulation of tumor cells with lower expression levels of APOE, associated with advanced stages of PTC and cervical metastasis. APOE overexpression significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating the ABCA1-LXR axis. APOE(-) tumor cells may promote tumor growth by interacting with dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells via CD99- rather than CD6-regulated signaling. We established a machine learning-based scRNA-seq data, 13-gene signature predictive of lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a distinct APOE(-) tumor cell population associated with cervical metastasis and poor prognosis. Our results and models have potential clinical, prognostic, and therapeutic implications for advanced PTC. KEY POINTS: A subpopulation of tumor cells with lower expression levels of APOE was strongly associated with more advanced stages and metastasis of PTC. APOE-negative (APOE(-)) cellsoverall exhibited weaker interactions with immune cells. A machine-learning bioinformatics model based on scRNA-seq data of in-situ thyroid cancer tissue was established to predict lymph node metastasis."
39810181,Single-cell transcriptomics unveils multifaceted immune heterogeneity in early-onset versus late-onset cervical cancer.,"Early-onset (EOCC) and late-onset cervical cancers (LOCC) represent two clinically distinct subtypes, each defined by unique clinical manifestations and therapeutic responses. However, their immunological profiles remain poorly explored. Herein, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomic data from 4 EOCC and 4 LOCC samples to compare their immune architectures. Epithelial cells in EOCC exhibited a notable dual immunological phenotype, characterized by immune-suppressive properties driven by elevated CXCL production, alongside immune-stimulatory features linked to heightened HLA molecule expression. CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in LOCC demonstrated a heightened activation state, while NK cells exhibited diminished cytotoxicity. Macrophages in LOCC displayed enhanced polarization towards both M1 and M2 phenotypes, along with dendritic cells showing augmented antigen-presenting capacity. Regarding cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), EOCC was enriched with inflammatory CAFs, whereas LOCC harbored a higher proportion of antigen-presenting CAFs. These findings reveal the multifaceted immune heterogeneity between EOCC and LOCC, underscoring the imperative for age-tailored immunotherapeutic strategies."
39808208,Berberine inhibits prostate cancer progression by inducing ferroptosis: evidence from network pharmacology.,"The uncertain ferroptosis-related role of berberine in prostate cancer was explored using network pharmacology methodology. Integration of ferroptosis targets in prostate cancer from the Genecard database and berberine targets from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and SwissTargetPrediction databases revealed 17 common targets. Among these, 10 hub genes, including CCNB1 , CDK1 , AURKA , AR , CDC42 , ICAM1 , TYMS , NTRK1 , PTGS 2, and SCD , were identified. Enrichment analyses yielded 799 Gene Ontology terms and 23 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with berberine-related targets. Molecular docking simulations indicated berberine's binding capacity to all hub genes. In-vitro studies on LNCaP and PC3 cells demonstrated berberine's inhibition of cell proliferation and significant downregulation of TYMS , CCNB1 , AURKA , CDK1 , and SCD in both cell lines. Berberine exhibited cell line-specific effects by reducing AR expression in LNCaP cells and suppressing ICAM1 in PC3 cells. Overall, berberine shows promise in inhibiting prostate cancer progression through modulation of ferroptosis-related genes, including TYMS , AR , CCNB1 , AURKA , CDK1 , ICAM1 , NTRK1 , SCD , and CDC42 ."
39807632,"UBE2S, downregulated by miR-152-3p, facilitates prostate cancer progression through the PTEN-mediated AKT/mTOR pathway.","OBJECTIVES: In recent years, the incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) have still not been significantly reduced and the mechanisms of tumor onset and progression are still not fully understood. The pathogenic mechanisms and upstream regulation of UBE2S expression in prostate cancer have not been elucidated. METHODS: Here, we performed bioinformatic analysis of public databases to reveal the expression of UBE2S in PCa and its association with Gleason score, tumor staging, biochemical recurrence, and survival. Subsequently, the effect of UBE2S on the proliferation and invasive capacity of PCa cells was explored. Next, miR-152-3p was identified to bind to the 3'-UTR of UBE2S mRNA and down-regulated in PCa through luciferase reporter assays. Dual immunofluorescence assay and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to verify the regulatory role of UBE2S on PTEN. Finally, the molecular mechanism of UBE2S regulation of PCa progression was further confirmed by rescue experiments and in vivo nude mouse subcutaneous transplantation tumor experiments. RESULTS: UBE2S expression was upregulated in PCa and correlated with patient Gleason score, TNM stage, biochemical recurrence, and disease-free survival. miR-152-3p regulated UBE2S expression in PCa by binding to the UBE2S mRNA 3'-UTR. Mechanistically, UBE2S combines with PTEN and ubiquitinates it, leading to PTEN degradation and ultimately promoting PCa progression via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: UBE2S, down-regulated by miR-152-3p, plays an important role in the onset and progression of PCa through the PTEN-mediated Akt/mTOR pathway and may become a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for PCa."
39807621,Prospective validation study of a combined urine and plasma test for predicting high-grade prostate cancer in biopsy naive men.,"OBJECTIVE: Early and accurate diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC) is crucial for effective treatment. Diagnosing  clinically insignificant cancers can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, highlighting the importance of accurately selecting patients for further evaluation based on improved risk prediction tools. Novel biomarkers offer promise for enhancing this diagnostic process. In this study, we aimed to externally validate a previously developed urine and plasma biomarker test in a biopsy-naive population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine and blood samples were prospectively collected from 362 biopsy-naive men with suspected PC before they underwent transrectal prostate biopsies. The expression levels of a 10-gene mRNA panel were quantified using reverse transcription/quantitative polymerase chain reaction of both urine and plasma. These gene expression levels, combined with clinical features and plasma prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, were used to predict the presence of International Society of Urological Pathology grade group >/= 2 PC. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 314 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker test were 87% (95% CI: 79-93%) and 42% (95% CI: 36-49%), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.7-0.82) for the biomarker test probability and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.59-0.72) for PSA (p = 0.02). The test's negative predictive value was 89% (CI: 81-94%). CONCLUSION: This study did not replicate the previously reported high accuracy of the biomarker test, highlighting the need for further refinement and robust external validation to ensure reliable performance across diverse patient populations."
39807103,Analysis of endometrial liquid‑based cytology samples to detect somatic mutations and classify ovarian cancer.,"Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, and screening methods have not been established. Biomarkers based on molecular genetic characteristics must be identified to develop diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for all cancer types, particularly ovarian cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of genetic analysis of cervical and endometrial liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens for detecting somatic mutations in patients with ovarian cancer. The data of 19 patients with ovarian cancer treated between August 2019 and July 2022 were analyzed. LBC specimens from the cervix and endometrium of patients with preoperatively suspected ovarian cancer were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted from these LBC specimens and surgically removed cancer tissue sections for genetic analysis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of cervical and endometrial LBC revealed genetic mutations similar to those in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues in 42% of ovarian cancer cases, including negative cervical and endometrial cytology cases and early-stage cases. The pathogenic variants detected were PIK3CA (n=1), RB1 (n=1) and TP53 (n=6). In high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) cases, the diagnosis rate was 54.5%, which was higher than that of other histological types. In univariate analysis of patients with HGSC, the presence of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma tended to be associated with the detection of somatic mutations in LBC samples. NGS analysis of cervical and endometrial LBC samples revealed genetic variants similar to those in FFPE tissues from ovarian cancer cases and may be useful as a noninvasive screening method for detecting somatic mutations and classifying ovarian cancer."
39803822,Identification of pyrimidine metabolism-based molecular subtypes and prognostic signature to predict immune landscape and guide clinical treatment in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We previously described the enrichment of plasma exosome metabolites in CRPC, PCa, and TFC cohorts, and found significant differences in pyrimidine metabolites. The PMGs is associated with the clinical prognosis of several cancers, but its biological role in PCa is still unclear. METHODS: This study extracted 98 reliable PMGs, and analyzed their somatic mutations, expression levels, and prognostic significance. Unsupervised clustering was applied to classify patients with PCa into clusters based on six PMGs that were related to the prognosis of PCa. The TME, gene mutations, and immune escape ability were compared among the clusters. A scoring algorithm based on prognostic PMGs, referred to as the PMGscore, was developed. TK1 was identified and the biological functions of TK1 were determined using loss-of-function experiments. RNA sequencing was subsequently performed to determine the molecules associated with the underlying mechanisms of TK1 function. RESULTS: In total, six out of 98 PMGs simultaneously exhibited differential expression in PCa and were correlated with BCR. Patients were clustered into two clusters according to the expression levels of these six PMGs, which reflected distinct clinical outcomes and immune cell infiltration characteristics. Clinical features, tumor prognosis, and functional annotation were analyzed. Subsequently, we constructed a prognostic signature using these six PMGs. In combination with other clinical traits, we found that the six PMGs' prognostic signature was an independent prognostic factor for patients with PCa. Finally, we found that the expression of TK1 was higher in CRPC tissues than in PCa tissues in three GEO datasets. The results indicated that TK1 promotes the growth and metastasis of PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for a PMG signature for PCa patients to accurately predict clinical prognosis. TK1 plays crucial roles in the progression of PCa cells and can be used as a potential therapeutic target for CRPC."
39803322,Temporally and Spatially Controlled Age-Related Prostate Cancer Model in Mice.,"The initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) are associated with aging. In the history of age-related PCa research, mice have become a more popular animal model option than any other species due to their short lifespan and rapid reproduction. However, PCa in mice is usually induced at a relatively young age, while it spontaneously develops in humans at an older age. Thus, it is essential to develop a method by which the PCa initiation and progression timeline can be strictly controlled to mimic human physiological conditions. One milestone in this field was the identification of the prostate-specific transcription factor, Probasin (Pb), which allowed for the prostate-specific expression of genes knocked into the mice's genome. Another milestone is the establishment of the preclinical mouse model with Pten conditionally knocked out in the prostate tissue, which closely mimics the formation and growth of human PCa. Hereby, we present the prostate-specific temporally and spatially controlled Pten knockout PCa mouse model that can be induced using an adenovirus-based Cre-LoxP system. The Cre recombinase (Cre) is inserted into an adenovirus vector. Unlike Pb-Cre knock-in models (which are spatially but not temporally controlled), the expression of Cre is activated to knock out Pten from the mice's prostate epithelial cells once injected. The viral delivery procedures strictly control the location and time of Pten knockout. This novel approach provides a powerful age-related murine model for PCa, emphasizing the effect of aging on prostate carcinogenesis. Key features * In vivo delivery of Cre recombinase adenovirus (Ad-Cre-Luc) in Pten LoxP/LoxP (L/L) mice. * Generation of Cre-expressing Ad-Cre-Luc-mediated ablation of Pten in anterior prostate epithelial cells of adult Pten L/L mice at different ages. * The Ad-Cre-Luc-mediated ablation of Pten leads to hyperplasia that progresses through prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to adenocarcinoma. * PIN refers to the non-cancerous growth of epithelial cells in the prostate tissue-not cancer but a precursor of prostate cancer [1]."
39802931,Gold Nanoparticle Inhibits the Tumor-Associated Macrophage M2 Polarization by Inhibiting m(6)A Methylation-Dependent ATG5/Autophagy in Prostate Cancer.,"Background: This study aims to study how gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) function in the recruitment and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods: Phorbol ester (PMA)-treated THP-1 cells were cocultured with LNCaP or PC3 cells to simulate TAMs. Macrophage M2 polarization levels were detected using flow cytometry and M2 marker determination. ATG5 expression was detected by western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was used to analyze the N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) site activity of ATG5 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). Methylated RNA immune precipitation (MeRIP)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to determine the m(6)A levels at ATG5 3'-UTR. Xenograft mouse models were used to determine the function of AuNPs in vivo. Results: Macrophages exhibited reduced M2 polarization in both HSPC and CRPC cells after AuNP treatment which was prevented by induction of autophagy. AuNP treatment decreased the m(6)A levels in the 3'-UTR of ATG5. Mutational analysis of potential m(6)A sites within ATG5 3'-UTR revealed that these sites were required for AuNP regulation, indicating that AuNPs inhibited ATG5 levels in an m(6)A-dependent manner. The mouse model revealed that AuNPs significantly reduced the M2 polarization of TAMs in an autophagy-dependent manner in vivo. This suggests that AuNPs inhibit tumor growth in vivo partially through targeting M2 TAM. Conclusion: The ATG5/autophagy pathway is inhibited by AuNP treatment in an METTL3/m(6)A-dependent manner. AuNPs inhibit the TAM M2 polarization in HSPC and CRPC by inhibiting ATG5/autophagy."
39801921,Whole-Genome Methylation Sequencing Analysis and Functional Verification of LIM-Homeobox Family Genes in Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Gene methylation in cells is an important factor in tumorigenesis, and radiotherapy can change DNA methylation in cells. In this study, complete genome methylation sequencing (BS-Seq) technology was used to analyze the genome-wide methylation of patients with cervical cancer before and after radiotherapy. METHODS: Three pairs of cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples were collected from patients before and after radiotherapy in July 2020. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were generated using WGBS. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify differential methylation regions (DMRs) and their associated genes and pathways. The study focused on the methylation changes of LHX2, LHX5, and LHX9 genes, assessing their expression levels using qRT-PCR and correlating these changes with cervical cancer stages. RESULTS: MCG was the main way of genomic DNA methylation in the three patients. The DNA methylation level and methylation density on each chromosome varied greatly. As revealed by comparison of methylation before and after radiation in the three patients, 1287, 1261 and 789 differential methylation genes were identified, respectively. 3) Combined with clinical treatment, methylation level difference and correlation enrichment analysis, it was found that LHX2, LHX5 and LHX9 were closely related to the occurrence and development of cervical cancer. After 5-Aza-DC and radiotherapy, the methylation of the CpG islands in LHX2, LHX5 and LHX9 genes in these patients was decreased (p < 0.01), and the mRNA and protein expression levels were relatively increased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In our present work, genome-wide DNA methylation maps of cervical cancer tissues before and after radiotherapy were successfully constructed. We found that LHX5 and LHX9 genes are closely related to cervical cancer. LHX5 and LHX9 have a negative effect on cervical cancer. The migration ability of LHX9 silenced cells was significantly enhanced after irradiation."
39799530,Transforming cancer screening: the potential of multi-cancer early detection (MCED) technologies.,"Early cancer detection substantially improves the rate of patient survival; however, conventional screening methods are directed at single anatomical sites and focus primarily on a limited number of cancers, such as gastric, colorectal, lung, breast, and cervical cancer. Additionally, several cancers are inadequately screened, hindering early detection of 45.5% cases. In contrast, Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) assays offer simultaneous screening of multiple cancers from a single liquid biopsy and identify molecular changes before symptom onset. These tests assess DNA mutations, abnormal DNA methylation patterns, fragmented DNA, and other tumor-derived biomarkers, indicating the presence of cancer and predicting its origin. Moreover, MCED assays concurrently detect multiple cancers without recommended screening protocols, potentially revolutionizing cancer screening and management. Large trials have reported promising results, achieving 50-95% sensitivity and 89-99% specificity for multiple cancer types. However, challenges, regarding improving accuracy, addressing ethical issues (e.g., psychosocial impact assessment), and integrating MCED into healthcare systems, must be addressed to achieve widespread adoption. Furthermore, prospective multi-institutional studies are crucial for demonstrating the clinical benefits in diverse populations. This review provides an overview of the principles, development status, and clinical significance of MCED tests, and discusses their potential and challenges."
39799479,Variants of the ABCG2 gene in Mexican mestizo patients with prostate cancer.,"ABCG2 transporter protein is one of several markers of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs). Gene variants of ABCG2 could affect protein expression, function, or both. The aim of this study was to identify the genetic variability of the ABCG2 gene in Mexican patients with prostate cancer. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was obtained from peripheral blood samples of 32 Mexican patients with prostate cancer. ABCG2 gene was sequenced. The electropherograms were analyzed using mutation surveyor DNA mutation analysis software (Softgenetics). The ABCG2 gene sequence revealed the presence of 22 variants: 19 previously described and three previously undescribed gene variants as part of the ABCG2 gene variability in the Mexican mestizo population (R263K G>A, R378K G>A, and Q531Q G>A). No ABCG2 variant was identified in one patient, but 1 to 12 variants were identified in the remaining 31 patients. The transition G>A was the most frequently found substitution. The largest number of ABCG2 variants was located in exon 9, and at least one of them was present in 28 of the 31 subjects in the Mexican population. The individual genetic variability of ABCG2 should be analyzed, considering its possible usefulness in personalized medicine in patients with prostate cancer."
39799471,Comparative Analysis of Acquired Resistance to Bortezomib in Prostate Cancer Cells Using Proteomic and Bioinformatic Tools.,"Chemotherapy is a potent tool against cancer, but drug resistance remains a major obstacle. To combat this, understanding the molecular mechanisms behind resistance in cancer cells and the protein expression changes driving these mechanisms is crucial. Targeting the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) has proven effective in treating multiple myeloma and shows promise for solid tumours. Despite initial success with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, acquired resistance soon after treatment poses a significant challenge to its efficacy. In this study, we explored proteins potentially involved in acquired resistance to bortezomib using label-free nLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. The investigation revealed 299 proteins with notable differences in expression levels in the bortezomib-resistant PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Using bioinformatics tools, we illustrated the top 10 gene ontology (GO) processes [e.g., translational initiation (p = 5.964E-10), CRD-mediated mRNA stabilisation (p = 1.636E-5), and hydrogen ion transmembrane transport (p = 6.46E-5)] and the top 20 KEGG [e.g., metabolic pathways (p = 7.601E-13), biosynthesis of amino acids (p = 3.834E-12), and chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species (p = 1.891E-4)] and REACTOME [e.g., metabolism (p = 4.182E-21), translation (p = 9.484E-18), and Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) (p = 1.829E-8)] pathways in the PC3-resistant cells. We further refined our results by comparing them with globally validated TCGA datasets. We correlated the 299 proteins identified through proteomic analysis with tumour aggressiveness and resistance by comparing them with the TCGA nodal metastasis N0 vs. N1 datasets using the UALCAN portal and identified 37 proteins consistent with our results. We believe that a combination of bortezomib with chemotherapeutics targeting these proteins could be effective in overcoming the resistance developed against bortezomib."
39799219,Nationwide cervical precancer screening in Ghana: concurrent HPV DNA testing and visual inspection under an expanded hub-and-spoke model.,"Cervical cancer continues to disproportionately burden women in sub-Saharan Africa, and is the commonest gynecological cancer in Ghana. The Cervical Cancer Prevention and Training Centre (CCPTC), Battor, Ghana spearheaded the Ghana arm of the mPharma 10,000 Women Initiative (mTTWI) between September 2021 and October 2022. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of nationwide concurrent screening using high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) DNA testing and visual inspection methods, as well as factors associated with the screening outcomes. We conducted a descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of hr-HPV infection (nationally and regionally) and cervical lesions among women screened by graduates of our training center in their own settings (spokes) with remote supervision and mentoring by CCPTC trainers (hub). We modeled factors associated with hr-HPV infection using nominal logistic regression. Among 5217 women screened (mean age, 40.1 years), the overall prevalence of hr-HPV infection and cervical lesions were 29.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 27.9-30.3) and 3.7% (95% CI 3.2-4.2), respectively. The prevalence distribution varied widely among regions, with the highest recorded in the Oti Region (32.8%) and the lowest recorded in the Upper West (20.7%) and North-East (20.7%) regions. The most frequently detected HPV genotype was other hr-HPV type(s) only (non-HPV16, non-HPV18) (23.5%; 95% CI 22.3-24.7), followed by HPV16 only (1.5%; 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and mixed infection with HPV18 + other hr-HPV type(s) (1.2%; 95% CI 0.9-1.5). Factors found to be significantly associated with hr-HPV infection among women screened included age < 35 years, having a relationship status apart from married/cohabitation, nulliparity, and HIV positivity. Drawing from our implementation of this model within the mTTWI, we posit that while Ghana prepares for organized screening, coordinating opportunistic screening could enable a phased expansion of cervical precancer screening with the help of international and local partners. This approach, combined with concurrent testing (hr-HPV DNA testing and visual inspection), holds promise for mitigating loss to follow-up among women requiring additional evaluation and lesion management."
39797819,Proteomic Profiling of Potential E6AP Substrates via Ubiquitin-based Photo-Crosslinking Assisted Affinity Enrichment.,"The ubiquitin (Ub) ligase E6AP, encoded by the UBE3A gene, has been causally associated with human diseases including cervical cancer and Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Yet, our knowledge about disease-relevant substrates of E6AP is still limited, presumably because at least some of these interactions are rather transient, a phenomenon observed for many enzyme-substrate interactions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to trap such potential transient interactions by combining a stable E6AP-Ub conjugate mimicking the active state of this enzyme with photo-crosslinking (PCL) followed by affinity enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry (AE-MS). To enable PCL, we equipped Ub with diazirine moieties at distinct positions. We validated our PCL assisted AE-MS approach by identification of known (e. g. PSMD4, UCHL5) and potential new (e. g. MSH2) substrates of E6AP. Our findings suggest that PCL assisted AE-MS is indeed suited to identify substrates of E6AP, thereby providing insights into E6AP-associated pathologies, and, potentially, of other enzymes of the Ub-conjugating system."
39796728,Current Status of Neoadjuvant Treatment Before Surgery in High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.,"Localized high-risk (HR) prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease whose likelihood of a biochemical recurrence, metastatic progression and cancer-related mortality after initial treatment is higher when compared with patients with low (LR) or intermediate-risk (IR) disease. In the past, neoadjuvant therapy has shown an improvement in postoperative oncological variables but failed to demonstrate any survival advantages. With the promising results from novel treatments in metastatic and non-metastatic castration resistant PCa settings, new evidence has appeared in the literature in the neoadjuvant setting. Background/Objectives: To describe the current evidence for different neoadjuvant treatments before a radical prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer. Methods: We performed a comprehensive English literature search for original and review articles through January-August 2024, using Pubmed, Medline and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, as well as a comprehensive review of different international guidelines, searching the following terms: ""neoadjuvant ADT prostate cancer"", ""neoadjuvant ADT"", ""prostate cancer surgery"" and ""neoadjuvant high-risk prostate cancer"". We included 61 papers for the final review. Results and Discussion: Neoadjuvant therapy is not recommended in daily practice by any international guideline. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines strongly discourage the use of ADT as a neoadjuvant therapy outside of clinical trials. ADT + ARTAs show promising data in phase-II trials, including favorable pCR, MRD, PSA relapse and salvage therapy rates. Clinical trials on chemotherapy, (177)Lu-PSMA, genomic-targeted therapies and markers of response leave room for further evidence acquisition due to their encouraging results. Conclusions: Currently, no phase III data supports systemic neoadjuvant therapy before RP. Phase II studies show promising data for ADT with second-generation agents, including favorable pCR, MRD, PSA relapse and salvage therapy rates."
39796693,Role of NF2 Mutation in the Development of Eleven Different Cancers.,"Background/Objectives: With the rise in prevalence of diagnostic genetic techniques like RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES), as well as biological treatment regiments for cancer therapy, several genes have been implicated in carcinogenesis. This review aims to update our understanding of the Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene and its role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. Methods: A comprehensive search of five online databases yielded 43 studies that highlighted the effect of sporadic NF2 mutations on several cancers, including sporadic meningioma, ependymoma, schwannoma, mesothelioma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, thyroid cancer, and melanoma. Of note were key biological pathways implicated in cancer formation resulting from sporadic NF2 mutations. Results: NF2 gene mutations are implicated in over 11 different cancers, including several CNS tumors, soli-organ tumors, and skin cancer. NF2 acts as a driver mutation in some cancers, as a non-driver mutation in some cancers, and has simple associated mutations with other cancers. In terms of biological pathway involvement, 8 of the 11 cancers with NF2 mutations show evidence of Hippo signaling cascade involvement. Conclusions: Several cancers characterized by mutations in the NF2 gene have associations with the Hippo signaling pathway. However, future studies remain to be done to further elucidate the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in the carcinogenesis of human NF2-mutant tumors. The findings of this review provide insights into the role of NF2 mutations in cancers, Hippo signaling in NF2-mutant cancers, and current gaps in our knowledge regarding the two."
39796635,Spatial Genomics Identifies Heat Shock Proteins as Key Molecular Changes Associated to Adipose Periprostatic Space Invasion in Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To identify molecular changes during PCa invasion of adipose space using Spatial Transcriptomic Profiling of PCa cells. METHODS: This study was performed on paired intraprostatic and extraprostatic samples obtained from radical prostatectomy with pT3a pathological stages. RESULTS: Differential gene expression revealed upregulation of heat shock protein genes: DNAJB1, HSPA8, HSP90AA1, HSPA1B, HSPA1A in PCa PanCK+ cells from the adipose periprostatic space. Extraprostatic extension was significantly associated with overexpression of genes involved in metastatic spread (EGR1, OR51E2, SPON2), of aggressiveness ERG negative signature of enhancers of androgen receptor (HOXB13, FOXA1), and of PSMA (FOLH1). They were associated with loss at 6q, 10q, 16q, and gain at 8q24 locus. CONCLUSIONS: PCa invasion of adipose EPE induces adaptative process related to heat shock proteins; PCa cells in EPE also present transcriptomics signatures for ERG independent aggressiveness, androgen receptor co-activation, and specific CNV changes."
39796175,The Emerging Predictive and Prognostic Role of Aggressive-Variant-Associated Tumor Suppressor Genes Across Prostate Cancer Stages.,"Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) is characterized by a molecular signature involving combined defects in TP53, RB1, and/or PTEN (AVPC-TSGs), identifiable through immunohistochemistry or genomic analysis. The reported prevalence of AVPC-TSG alterations varies widely, reflecting differences in assay sensitivity, treatment pressure, and disease stage evolution. Although robust clinical evidence is still emerging, the study of AVPC-TSG alterations in prostate cancer (PCa) is promising. Alterations in TP53, RB1, and PTEN, as well as the combined loss of AVPC-TSGs, may have significant implications for prognosis and treatment. These biomarkers might help predict responses to various therapies, including hormonal treatments, cytotoxic agents, radiotherapy, and targeted therapies. Understanding the impact of these molecular alterations in patients with PCa is crucial for personalized management. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging prognostic and predictive roles of AVPC-TSG alterations across PCa stages. Moreover, we discuss the implications of different methods used for detecting AVPC-TSG alterations and summarize factors influencing their prevalence. As our comprehension of the genomic landscape of PCa disease deepens, incorporating genomic profiling into clinical decision making will become increasingly important for improving patient outcomes."
39794740,Integrative machine learning frameworks to uncover specific protein signature in neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma (NECC) is a rare but highly aggressive tumor. The clinical management of NECC follows neuroendocrine neoplasms and cervical cancer in general. However, the diagnosis and prognosis of NECC remain dismal. The aim of this study was to identify a specific protein signature for the diagnosis of NECC. METHODS: Protein and gene expression data for NECC and other cervical cancers were retrieved or downloaded from self-collected samples or public resources. Eleven machine-learning algorithms were packaged into 66 combinations, of which we selected the optimal algorithm, including randomForest, SVM-RFE, and LASSO, to select key NECC specific dysregulated proteins (kNsDEPs). The diagnostic effect of kNsDEPs was validated by a set of predictive models and immunohistochemical staining method. The dysregulation patterns of kNsDEPs were further investigated in other neuroendocrine carcinomas. RESULTS: Our results showed that NECC displays distinctive biological characteristics, such as HPV18 infection, and exhibits unique molecular features, particularly an enrichment in cytoskeleton-related functions. Furthermore, secretagogin (SCGN), adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2), and calcyclin-binding protein (CACYBP) were identified as kNsDEPs. These kNsDEPs play a central role in cytoskeleton protein binding and showcase robust diagnostic ability and specificity for NECC. Moreover, the concurrent upregulation of SCGN and CACYBP, along with the downregulation of CAP2, represents a unique feature of NECC, distinguishing it from other neuroendocrine carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers the significance of kNsDEPs and elucidates their regulated networks in the context of NECC. It highlights the pivotal role of kNsDEPs in NECC diagnosis, thus offering promising prospects for the development of diagnostic biomarkers for NECC."
39794681,Prognostic Testing for Prostate Cancer-A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing a Prostatype P-Score Biomarker Approach to Standard Clinical Practice.,"BACKGROUND: The Prostatype score (P-score) is a prognostic biomarker that integrates a three-gene (IGFBP3, F3, and VGLL3) signature derived from prostate biopsy samples, with key clinical parameters, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, Gleason grade, and tumor stage at diagnosis. The test has demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for prostate cancer outcomes compared with traditional risk categorization systems such as D'Amico. Notably, it reclassifies a higher proportion of patients into the low-risk category, making them eligible for active surveillance. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the P-score in comparison with D'Amico and the Swedish National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) risk categorization systems. METHODS: A two-step decision analytic model was developed. The model consisted of a decision tree-informed Markov structure estimating the lifetime outcomes of 60-year-old men with diagnosed prostate cancer. Prostate cancer was classified as low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk using either the P-score or D'Amico. Initial therapy was based on observed treatment patterns from the Swedish NPCR. Costs (SEK, year 2022) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated from a healthcare perspective and discounted at 3% per year; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was the primary outcome. RESULTS: The P-score led to cost savings and generated an additional 0.19 QALYs compared with D'Amico. The added costs of the genetic test and higher costs of active surveillance and radiotherapy were counterbalanced by savings from reduced costs of surgery, treatment-related side-effects, and metastatic disease. The gain in QALYs was primarily due to the avoidance of metastatic disease and a reduction in treatment-related side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the P-score is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to D'Amico for prognostic evaluation of newly diagnosed prostate cancer in Sweden and compared with NPCR when health-related quality of life was included."
39793235,Activity of Platinum Chemotherapy in Men With Prostate Cancer With and Without DNA Damage Repair Mutations.,"INTRODUCTION: Alterations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes occur in 20%-30% of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) which may increase sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy. Specifically, exceptional responses to platinum chemotherapy have been reported among patients with BRCA mutations. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of platinum chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC with and without HRR. PATIENT AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multi-institution series, we analyzed patients with mCRPC to assess response to platinum-containing chemotherapy based on HRR alteration status. Outcome measures were prostate specific antigen (PSA)50 response rate (percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% decline in PSA from baseline), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: From 1999 to 2020, 24 patients with mCRPC who received platinum chemotherapy were included with 7 patients analyzable for PSA outcomes. HRR alterations were found in 19 out of 24 patients (79.2%) with mutations recognized in 11 different HRR genes. Patients with a HRR alteration achieved a PSA50 response rate of 20% (1 out of 5) after platinum chemotherapy compared to 50% (1 out of 2) in patients without a HRR mutation. No difference in OS or PSA PFS was detected among patients with BRCA1/2 mutations compared to HRR alterations other than BRCA1/2 and patients without HRR alterations. CONCLUSION: In patients with mCRPC, we did not find a statistical difference in anti-tumor activity after receiving platinum chemotherapy among patients harboring a pathogenic HRR alterations compared to patients without a HRR alteration. Additionally, we were unable to detect an association between BRCA1/2 mutation status and response to platinum chemotherapy. Platinum chemotherapy, however, had clinically meaningful activity in a subset of patients regardless of HRR alteration status. Additional studies are warranted using genomic data to predict sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy."
39792729,"Causal relationship between rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis and risk of prostate cancer: Multivariable and bidirectional Mendelian-randomization analyses.","Previous studies have suggested an association between autoimmune diseases (AIDs) and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the causal relationship between AID and PCa remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the causal association between 3 common AIDs, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and the risk of PCa. We used genome-wide association studies summary statistics to conduct forward and reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) in a two-sample framework. We also incorporated risk factors, including smoking and obesity, in the multivariable MR analysis. Multiple sensitivity analysis methods have been adopted to test the robustness of our results. Our univariable MR analysis showed that genetically predicted RA was associated with an increased risk of PCa (odds ratio: 1.036, 95% CI: 1.022-1.049, P < .001). However, there was no significant association between SLE or AS and PCa. The multivariable MR analysis adjusted for smoking and obesity confirmed the positive association between RA and PCa, but not for the other 2 autoimmune diseases. In the reverse MR analysis, we did not find any significant inverse causal associations between PCa and the 3 autoimmune diseases. Our study suggested that genetically predicted RA was likely causally associated with an increased risk of PCa, while there is no significant causal relationship between SLE or AS and PCa. These findings provided new insights into the relationship between autoimmune diseases and PCa and might inform future research and clinical practice."
39789383,Autophagy Associated Genes (ARGs) -Based Predictive Model AIDPS for Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. Autophagy-related genes (ARGs) may play an important role in various biological processes of PCa. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate autophagy-related features to predict clinical outcomes in patients with PCa. Single-cell sequencing data and RNA sequencing data was included from public GEO and TCGA databases. Cells were clustered and annotated by dimension reduction cluster analysis. Epithelial cells, T cells and fibroblasts were isolated to explore their heterogeneity. Autophagy-related genes were obtained from the HADb database. Survival analysis was conducted by K-M curve, and prognostic risk model was established using 101 machine learning algorithms. In addition, we performed gene colocalisation analysis and Mendelian randomisation analysis. Univariate Cox analysis was used to screen out prognostic genes from DEGs and ARGs in each dataset. Risk model was generated by artificial intelligence-derived prognostic signature (AIDPS), which showed better prognostic performance in every dataset than other published models for PCa. The disease-free period (DFS) of patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse than that in the low-risk group (all p < 0.05). The best model is the Ridge (C-index 0.726). We found significant differences in IC50 values of the Dactinomycin_1811, Dactolisib_1057, Luminespib_1559 and Paclitaxel_1080 between groups. In SNP sites rs2743987 and rs7768988, there was a significant correlation between prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Our ARG-based predictive model AIDPS is a reliable and effective tool for prognosis and treatment of prostate cancer."
39788498,Identification of apoptosis-related long non-coding RNAs expression profiles in patient with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3.,"OBJECTIVES: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in cancer biology. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) is the most severe precancerous lesion of cervical cancer. However, the mechanism of multiple lncRNAs in CIN3 has not been studied in-depth and is worth exploring. This study aims to summarize the lncRNA expression profile in CIN 3 and screen for lncRNAs with potential oncogenic effects. METHODS: To further clarify the role of lncRNAs in the development of CIN3, this study collected cancer tissue and para-cancer tissue specimens from three CIN3 patients. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was used to construct expression profiles of lncRNAs and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) methods. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed with computational methods. We obtained their possible target genes through the cis- and trans-regulatory analysis of the lncRNAs. In addition, this study predicted new transcripts and lncRNAs by Cufflinks analysis and coding potential identification (Coding Potential Calculator) analysis to discover new tumor regulatory molecules. RESULTS: The differential expressions of 1 555 genes, 1 562 mRNAs, 241 ncRNAs, and 6 616 new predicted-lncRNAs were found. The most prominently up-regulated and down-regulated lncRNAs were NR_145433.1 and ENST00000513672.1, respectively. KEGG analysis revealed that lncRNA-targeted genes were closely related to apoptosis, metabolic, p53 signaling pathway, and other cancer-related pathways. The real-time RT-PCR validation results of 5 apoptosis-related lncRNAs (NR_145433.1, ENST00000510610.2, UC001Kfo, ENST00000602964.1, and NR_123733.1) in cervical cancer were consistent with the sequencing results. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive expression profile of lncRNAs in CIN3 patients, particularly the apoptosis-related expression profile of lncRNAs, and provides direction and clues for the study of cervical cancer and the search for potential therapeutic targets."
39787437,Germline and Somatic Genomic Testing for Metastatic Prostate Cancer: ASCO Guideline.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate evidence on germline and somatic genomic testing for patients with metastatic prostate cancer and provide recommendations. METHODS: A systematic review by a multidisciplinary panel with patient representation was conducted. The PubMed database was searched from January 2018 to May 2024. Articles were selected for inclusion if they reported on patients with metastatic prostate cancer who received a germline or somatic genomic test and/or made comparisons between those tests, reported detection rates, prognostic information, or treatment implications. RESULTS: A total of 1,713 papers were identified in the literature search. After applying the eligibility criteria, 14 remained: eight systematic reviews and six clinical trials. RECOMMENDATIONS: Patients with metastatic prostate cancer should undergo both germline and somatic DNA sequencing using panel-based assays. These tests can guide the use of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, which have a survival benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, germline testing may have screening implications for additional cancers for patients and cascade testing implications for family members. The data supporting when to perform repeat testing and optimal tissue type to use (eg, primary tumor v metastatic biopsy versus circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA] testing) are more limited, but this panel recommends considering retesting in patients whose results were previously negative or uninformative, and to consider either a metastatic biopsy or ctDNA when a significant change in clinical status occurs. Next-generation genomic sequencing findings that are associated with prognostic only (and not predictive) value should not be used to guide treatment outside of a clinical trial.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/genitourinary-cancer-guidelines."
39786309,EZH2-mediated downregulation of miR-155-5p contributes to prostate cancer cell malignancy through SMAD2 and TAB2.,"miR-155 exhibits variable expression in different tumors and fulfills diverse biological roles. However, specific molecular mechanisms by which miR-155-5p, which is under-expressed in prostate cancer (PCa), operates are yet to be elucidated. The role of the enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2)/miR-155-5p axis in PCa was determined by using bioinformatics tools and performing luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR, CCK-8 assays, cell migration and invasion assays, RNA isolation, reverse transcription quantity (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. miR-155-5p expression would be reduced and promoter methylation would increase in PCa. After 5-Aza-CdR treatment and the integration of the upstream promoter of miR-155-5p into a pGL3-basic/luciferase construct, fluorescence reporter analysis showed that promoter hypermethylation mediated the suppression of miR-155-5p in PCa. Furthermore, EZH2 attached to the miR-155-5p promoter and modulated its expression. EZH2 facilitated the suppression of miR-155-5p through enhanced H3K27me3 methylation, considerably affecting its expression. Through dual-luciferase assays, SMAD2 and TAB2 were confirmed as downstream targets of miR-155-5p, regulating the PCa cellular phenotype governed by miR-155-5p. Lastly, 5-Aza-CdR regulated miR-155-5p expression by modulating its promoter methylation and influenced the malignant behavior of PCa cells. EZH2 promotes H3K27me3 methylation, repressing miR-155-5p expression, which subsequently upregulates the downstream targets SMAD2 and TAB2 and promotes PCa cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion."
39781521,Doublecortin-like kinase 1 promotes stem cell-like properties through the Hippo-YAP pathway in prostate cancer.,"Background: Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been revealed to be involved in modulating cancer stemness and tumor progression, but its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains obscure. Castration-resistant and metastatic PCa exhibit aggressive behaviors, and current therapeutic approaches have shown limited beneficial effects on the overall survival rate of patients with advanced PCa. This study aimed to investigate the biological role and potential molecular mechanism of DCLK1 in the progression of PCa. Methods: The role of DCLK1 in maintaining PCa stem cell-like properties was explored via gain- and loss-of-function studies, including colony formation assays, sphere formation assays and measurement of stemness-related marker expression. A set of transcriptomic data for patients with PCa was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas to analyze the correlations between DCLK1 and Hippo pathway gene expression. The mechanism by which DCLK1 regulates Hippo signaling and cancer stemness was further investigated in vitro by methods such as Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and luciferase reporter assays and in vivo by animal studies. Results: The gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that upregulating DCLK1 promoted but downregulating DCLK1 suppressed aspects of the PCa stem cell-like phenotype, including colony formation, sphere formation and the expression of stemness-related markers (c-Myc, OCT4, CD44, NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4). Importantly, bioinformatics analysis indicated that DCLK1 is closely correlated with the Hippo signaling pathway in PCa. Further in vitro assays revealed that DCLK1 inhibits the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to yes-associated protein (YAP) activation via large tumor suppressor homolog 1 (LATS1). Moreover, the effect of DCLK1 on abolishing stemness traits in PCa was observed after treatment with verteporfin, a small molecule inhibitor of YAP. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the in vivo findings confirmed that DCLK1 promoted the tumorigenicity and stem cell-like traits of PCa cells via Hippo-YAP signaling. Conclusion: DCLK1 promotes stem cell-like characteristics by inducing LATS1-mediated YAP signaling activation, ultimately leading to PCa tumor growth and progression. Thus, our findings identify an attractive candidate for the development of cancer stem cell-targeted therapies to improve treatment outcomes in advanced PCa."
39781359,Uncovering the Role of ALDH1A2 in Prostate Cancer: Insights from Genetic and Expression Analyses.,"Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is a critical concern in prostate cancer management; however, its underlying genetic determinants remain poorly understood. The aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) gene family is involved in cellular detoxification and biosynthetic processes and has been implicated in various cancers. This study investigated the association between the ALDH1 family members and prostate cancer recurrence. We conducted a two-stage genetic association study involving 134 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the ALDH1 family to assess their association with BCR-free survival in prostate cancer. Gene set and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to explore the biological relevance of significant genes across multiple datasets. ALDH1A2 rs16939929 showed a robust association with BCR-free survival in both discovery and replication cohorts. Functional analyses indicated that rs16939929 affected ALDH1A2 expression in various tissues. Pooled analysis of 42 prostate cancer gene expression datasets revealed that ALDH1A2 expression was significantly lower in prostate cancer tissues and higher expression was associated with better patient prognosis. Enrichment analyses revealed that ALDH1A2 was co-expressed with genes primarily involved in cell adhesion pathways. Further analysis confirmed that several of these co-expressed cell adhesion molecules were associated with improved patient survival. In addition, ALDH1A2 expression was associated with increased immune cell infiltration into the prostate cancer microenvironment. In conclusion, ALDH1A2 rs16939929 is a significant predictor of BCR-free survival in prostate cancer, potentially through its effects on the gene expressions of ALDH1A2 and cell adhesion molecules. These findings suggest that ALDH1A2 plays a tumor-suppressive role in prostate cancer progression."
39776398,Expression of vesiculation-related genes is associated with a tumor-promoting microenvironment: a pan-cancer analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) released by tumor cells (tumor-derived sEV; TEX) mediate intercellular communication between tumor and non-malignant cells and were shown to impact disease progression. This study investigates the relationship between the expression levels of the vesiculation-related genes linked to sEV production and the tumor microenvironment (TME). METHODS: Two independent gene sets were analyzed, both previously linked to sEV production in various non-malignant or malignant cells. Expression profiles were compared among 28 tumor types listed in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene expression and survival analysis (GEPIA2), immunogenomic analysis (TISIDB), and genomic analysis (GSCA) were performed. RESULTS: Vesiculation-related genes were overexpressed in tissues of most tumor types compared to healthy tissues, and high expression levels were associated with worse overall survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, lower grade glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma but with improved overall survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Expression of these signatures correlated with an increased abundance of infiltrating CD4( +) T cells and dendritic cells, a decreased abundance of B cells and eosinophils, and activation of tumor cell apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways in all tumor types. 17-AAG was identified as a potential drug candidate to target tumors with elevated expression of vesiculation-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: Vesiculation-related genes were associated with distinct immunological and genomic landscapes further emphasizing the important role of TEX in cancer progression."
39773564,"Safety and efficacy of the therapeutic DNA-based vaccine VB10.16 in combination with atezolizumab in persistent, recurrent or metastatic HPV16-positive cervical cancer: a multicenter, single-arm phase 2a study.","BACKGROUND: Second-line treatment options for persistent, recurrent or metastatic (r/m) cervical cancer are limited. We investigated the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of the therapeutic DNA-based vaccine VB10.16 combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)16-positive r/m cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm, phase 2a study (NCT04405349, registered 26 May 2020) enrolled adult patients with persistent, r/m HPV16-positive cervical cancer. Patients received 3 mg VB10.16 (every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 12 weeks, hereafter every 6 weeks) combined with 1,200 mg atezolizumab (Q3W) for 48 weeks in total with a 12-month follow-up. The primary endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and objective response rate (ORR; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor V.1.1). ORR was assessed in the efficacy population, being all response-evaluable patients who received any administration of VB10.16 and atezolizumab and had at least one post-baseline imaging assessment. RESULTS: Between June 16, 2020, and January 25, 2022, 52 patients received at least one administration of study treatment. Of these, 47 patients had a minimum of one post-baseline tumor assessment. The median follow-up time for survival was 11.7 months. AEs related to VB10.16 were non-serious and mainly mild injection site reactions (9 of 52 patients). There were no signs of new toxicities other than what was already described with atezolizumab. ORR was 19.1% (95% CI 9.1% to 33.3%). Median duration of response was not reached (n.r.) (95% CI 2.2 to n.r.), median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1 to 6.2), and median overall survival was 21.3 months (95% CI 8.5 to n.r.). In programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive patients (n=24), ORR was 29.2% (95% CI 12.6 to 51.1). HPV16-specific T-cell responses were analyzed in 36 of 47 patients with an increase observed in 22/36 (61%). CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic DNA-based vaccine VB10.16 combined with atezolizumab was safe and well tolerated showing a promising clinically meaningful efficacy with durable responses in patients with persistent, r/m HPV16-positive cervical cancer, especially if PD-L1-positive."
39771106,Investigating the Potential Effects of 6PPDQ on Prostate Cancer Through Network Toxicology and Molecular Docking.,"(1) Background: N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPDQ), as a newly discovered environmental toxin, has been found more frequently in our living conditions. The literature reports that damage to the reproductive and cardiovascular system is associated with exposure to 6PPDQ. However, the relationship between 6PPDQ and cancer still requires more investigation. This research aims to investigate the association between 6PPDQ and prostate cancer. (2) Methods and Results: Based on the data retrieved from the Pharmmapper, CTD, SEA, SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCard, and OMIM databases, we summarized 239 potential targets utilizing the Venn tool. Through the STRING network database and Cytoscape software, we constructed a PPI network and confirmed ten core targets, including IGF1R, PIK3R1, PTPN11, EGFR, SRC, GRB2, JAK2, SOS1, KDR, and IRS1. We identified the potential pathways through which 6PPDQ acts on these core targets using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Ultimately, through molecular docking methods, 6PPDQ binds closely with these ten core targets. These findings indicate that 6PPDQ may influence the proteins related to prostate cancer and may be linked to prostate cancer via several known signaling pathways. (3) Conclusions: This article employs innovative network toxicology to elucidate the prostate carcinogenic effects of 6PPDQ through its modulation of specific vital genes and signaling pathways, thereby establishing a foundational platform for future investigations into the impact of 6PPDQ on prostate cancer and potentially other tumors."
39770497,The Comparative Effect of Morphine on Proliferation of Cancer Cell Lines Originating from Different Organs: An In Vitro Study.,"Background/Objectives: Opium consumption was recently classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monograph as carcinogenic to humans based on strong evidence for cancers of the larynx, lung, and urinary bladder, and limited evidence for cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and pharynx. This poses the question of a potential pro-cancer effect of pharmaceutical opioid analgesics. In vitro studies employing a variety of experimental conditions suggest that opioid alkaloids have proliferative or antiproliferative effects. We set out to reconcile this discrepancy and explore the hypothesis that opioids promote cancer cell proliferation in an organ-dependent fashion. Methods: Using strictly controlled conditions, we tested the effect of morphine on the proliferation of a series of human cancer cell lines isolated from organs where cancer risk was linked causally to opium consumption in human studies (i.e., lung, bladder, and larynx), or control organs where no link between cancer risk and opium consumption has been reported in human studies (i.e., breast, colon, prostate). Results: Our results showed a minimal effect on proliferation on any cell line and no trend supporting an organ-specific effect of morphine. Conclusions: This argues against a direct effect of opioids on tumour cell proliferation to support their organ-specific effect."
39768459,Advancements in Minimally Invasive Techniques and Biomarkers for the Early Detection of Endometrial Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Novel Diagnostic Approaches and Clinical Implications.,"This review evaluates the advances in the early detection and diagnosis of endometrial cancer (EC), emphasizing the growing importance of minimally invasive techniques and novel biomarkers. Current diagnostic protocols for EC rely heavily on invasive procedures such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), hysteroscopy, and endometrial biopsy, which, although effective, can be overly burdensome for patients and inefficient for asymptomatic or low-risk populations. As there is no consensus on EC screening in high-risk or general populations, recent studies have explored alternative methods using biofluids and genomic biomarkers to improve sensitivity and specificity and facilitate access for patients. This review summarizes findings on DNA methylation markers, circulating tumor-derived nucleic acids, and the potential of liquid biopsy approaches for the early detection of EC. These innovations may not only streamline screening but also reduce the need for invasive procedures. This review highlights the potential of these biomarkers to be integrated seamlessly into the existing cervical cancer screening programs, which could transform screening methods for endometrial cancer and support the development of personalized, less invasive diagnostic procedures."
39767606,Serum Antibodies Against the E5 Oncoprotein from Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Are Inversely Associated with the Infection and the Degree of Cervical Lesions.,"BACKGROUND: The humoral immune response against human papillomavirus (HPV) has been suggested as a source of biomarkers for the early detection of cervical cancer (CC). Therefore, we aimed to characterize the antibody response against HPV16 E5 in the natural history of cervical cancer and to determine its usefulness as a biomarker of HPV-associated cervical lesions. METHODS: This study was conducted at the Cuautla General Hospital, Morelos, Mexico, with women (18 to 64 years) who agreed to participate. Samples were obtained from 335 women with cervical lesions and 150 women with negative Papanicolaou tests. HPV genotyping was performed by PCR and pyrosequencing, and anti-E5 antibodies were detected by slot blot. RESULTS: The overall anti-E5 antibodies prevalence in the study was 17.9%, with the higher prevalence observed in the no lesion (NL, 49.4%) group, and with a downward trend according to the degree of the cervical lesion, from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-1 (CIN1, 32.2%) to CIN2 (11.5%) and CIN3/CC (6.9%). The logistic regression model showed negative associations of anti-E5 antibodies with CIN1 (OR = 0.38), CIN2 (OR = 0.42), and CIN3/CC (OR = 0.32) groups, being statistically significant. Contrast analysis showed an inverse relationship between anti-E5 antibodies with HPV DNA and the CIN1 (OR = 0.35), CIN2 (OR = 0.39), and CIN3/CC (OR = 0.31) groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anti-E5 antibodies could be associated with clearance of infection in women without lesions and with CIN1 lesions since an inverse relationship was observed between the presence of HPV DNA and anti-E5 antibodies. In contrast, with progression from CIN2/CIN3 to CC, the relationship was reversed, as the anti-E5 antibodies disappeared, and the frequency of the viral genome increased."
39766901,The Simultaneous Treatment of PC-3 Cells with the DNA-Demethylating Agent Decitabine and S-Adenosylmethionine Leads to Synergistic Anticancer Effects.,"Background: Epigenetic dysregulation is a common feature of cancer. Promoter demethylation of tumor-promoting genes and global DNA hypomethylation may trigger tumor progression. Epigenetic changes are unstable; thus, research has focused on detecting remedies that target epigenetic regulators. Previous studies have suggested that concordantly targeting hypomethylation and hypermethylation is beneficial for suppressing both the oncogenic and pro-metastatic functions of cancer cells. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of a combination of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and the demethylating agent decitabine on prostate cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Prostate cancer cells (PC-3) were treated with SAM, decitabine, or a combination of both. Proliferation, migration, invasion, and methylation assays were also performed. A transcriptome study was conducted to detect different gene clusters between the treatment groups, followed by analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and ingenuity pathway analysis. Finally, to gain information on differential gene expression, promoter methylation studies were performed. Results: Groups treated with decitabine, SAM, or their combination showed reduced proliferative capacity. The decitabine-treated group showed a marginal increase in cell migration and invasion, whereas the SAM-treated and combination treatment groups showed reduced invasion and migration potential. Methylation assays demonstrated the restoration of decitabine-induced demethylation in prostate cancer samples, whereas the transcriptome study revealed the upregulation of different gene clusters between the treatment groups. Methylation studies confirmed that SAM could restore the decitabine-induced demethylation of proto-oncogenes, but it did not induce the re-methylation of tumor-suppressor genes. Conclusions: Combination treatment with SAM and decitabine had an additive effect and did not nullify each other."
39766250,Cervical Cancer Cells Use the CD95 and IL-2 Pathways to Promote Their Proliferation and Survival.,"Cervical cancer is a global health problem; therapies focused on eliminating tumour cells and strengthening different immunotherapies are in development. However, it has been observed that cervical tumour cells can evade cell death mechanisms and generate immune system molecules to promote their proliferation and metastasis. In this context, we analysed the role of the IL-2 and CD95 pathways, essential molecules in activating the immune system and eliminating tumour cells. However, it is important to analyse their role in cervical tumour cells because these cells could be using these pathways to proliferate. In this study, we found that SiHa and HeLa cells respond to treatment, with 10 IU/mL of IL-2 inducing their proliferation and 100 IU/mL of IL-2 decreasing their proliferation. We also observed that they express a high percentage of the CD95 receptor and its ligand (CD95L) and that treatment with CD95 agonist antibodies at low doses increases cell proliferation. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment with high doses of IL-2 plus CD95 agonist antibody positively regulates LC3B accumulation. We did not observe apoptosis under any of the treatments carried out. In conclusion, cervical tumour cells can use the IL-2 and CD95 pathways to induce their proliferation and potentially activate cytoprotective mechanisms for survival."
39766159,Isolation of Plasma Extracellular Vesicles for High-Depth Analysis of Proteomic Biomarkers in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.,"Introduction: Prostate cancer treatment has been revolutionized by targeted therapies, including PARP inhibitors, checkpoint immunotherapies, and PSMA-targeted radiotherapies. Despite such advancements, accurate patient stratification remains a challenge, with current methods relying on genomic markers, tissue staining, and imaging. Extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived proteins offer a novel non-invasive alternative for biomarker discovery, holding promise for improving treatment precision. However, the characterization of plasma-derived EVs in prostate cancer patients remains largely unexplored. Methods: We conducted proteomic analyses on EVs isolated from plasma in 27 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. EVs were purified using ultracentrifugation and analyzed via mass spectrometry. Proteomic data were correlated with clinical markers such as serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and bone lesion counts. Statistical significance was assessed using Mann-Whitney t-tests and Spearman correlation. Results: The median age of patients was 74 (range: 44-94) years. At the time of blood collection, the median PSA level was 70 (range: 0.5-1000) ng/mL. All patients had bone metastasis. A total of 5213 proteins were detected, including EV-related proteins (CD9, CD81, CD63, FLOT1, TSG101) and cancer-related proteins (PSMA, B7-H3, PD-L1). Proteomic profiling of plasma EVs revealed a significant correlation between specific EV-derived proteins and clinical prognostic markers. B7-H3, LAT1, and SLC29A1 showed a strong association with serum PSA levels and number of bone lesions, indicating potential for these proteins to serve as biomarkers of disease burden and therapy response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the potential of EV-based proteomics for identifying biomarkers in mCRPC patients. Proteins such as B7-H3 and LAT1 could guide precision oncology approaches, improving patient stratification. Future research incorporating outcomes data and EV subpopulation analysis is needed to establish clinical relevance."
39765691,The Protein Corona on Nanoparticles for Tumor Targeting in Prostate Cancer-A Review of the Literature and Experimental Trial Protocol.,"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) recognizes the potential of technologies based on the use of nanoparticles (NPs) in revolutionizing clinical approaches to the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Recent research suggests that once NPs come into contact with the biological fluid of cancer patients, they are covered by proteins, forming a ""protein corona"" composed of hundreds of plasma proteins. The concept of a personalized, disease-specific protein corona, demonstrating substantial differences in NP corona profiles between patients with and without cancer, has been introduced. We developed the design of an experimental prospective single-center study with patients allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio of one of three arms: untreated patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), untreated patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), and metastatic prostate cancer patients starting systemic therapies with new androgen-targeted agents or taxanes. The protocol aims to develop and implement sensitive nanotools with two distinct objectives: First, to design NPs capable of selectively binding and detecting biomarkers in order to build a predictive diagnostic model to effectively discriminate between patient sera affected by BPH and PCa. Secondly, within the population with PCa, in the case of initial advanced metastatic diagnosis, the objective is to find biomarkers capable of predicting the response to systemic treatments to improve the precision and efficiency of monitoring treatment outcomes. For protein and metabolite corona experiments, we developed a cross-reactive sensor array platform with cancer detection capacity made of three liposomal formulations with different surface charges. For proteomic-NP studies, proteins were identified and quantified using nano-high-performance LC (nanoHPLC) coupled with MS/MS (nanoHPLC-MS/MS). Metabolites were instead analyzed using an untargeted metabolomic approach. Compared with previous review articles, the novelty of this review is represented by the analysis of the possible clinical applications of protein corona NPs focused on PCa and the presentation of a new clinical protocol in the metastatic phase of PCa."
39763898,Cellular cartography reveals mouse prostate organization and determinants of castration resistance.,"Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer, we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations - resembling human club and hillock cells - are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct prostate cancer subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for prostate cancer modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance."
39763034,EHMT2-mediated R-loop formation promotes the malignant progression of prostate cancer via activating Aurora B.,"BACKGROUND: Chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of cancer, is commonly linked to poor prognosis in high-grade prostate cancer (PCa). Paradoxically, excessively high levels of CIN may impair cancer cell viability. Consequently, understanding how tumours adapt to CIN is critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to identify genes overexpressed in PCa tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO datasets. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays were applied to determine the expression levels of euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), pT232-Aurora B and Cullin 3 (CUL3). The proliferation of cells was measured through CCK-8 tests, clonogenesis and subcutaneous xenografts of human PCa cells in BALB/c nude mice. Live cell imaging, immunofluorescence (IF) and flow cytometry were used to confirm the role of EHMT2 in PCa cell mitosis. Co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and IF assays further elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: EHMT2 was highly expressed in metastatic PCa tissues exhibiting elevated CIN and was strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with PCa. Silencing EHMT2 impaired cell division, inducing G2/M-phase arrest and mitotic catastrophe in PCa cells. Mechanistically, EHMT2 is indispensable to ensure the full activation of Aurora B through centromeric R-loop-driven ATR-CHK1 pathway, with EHMT2 protein expression peaking during the G2/M-phase. Moreover, CUL3 was identified as a binding partner of EHMT2, mediating its polyubiquitination and destabilising its protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a CUL3-EHMT2-Aurora B regulatory axis that safeguards accurate chromosome segregation in PCa cells, supporting the potential therapeutic application of EHMT2 inhibitors. KEY POINTS: Euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) is overexpressed in advanced prostate cancer, restraining catastrophic chromosomal instability (CIN) and enhancing cell fitness. EHMT2 functions via the centromeric R-loop-driven ATR-CHK1-Aurora B pathway to promote chromosomal stability. EHMT2 confers enzalutamide resistance via activating Aurora B. Cullin 3 (CUL3) promotes EHMT2 destabilisation via deubiquitination."
39762893,Single-cell RNA sequencing highlights the unique tumor microenvironment of small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma.,"Small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma is a highly aggressive tumor characterized by early metastasis, a high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. This study represents the first instance of single-cell sequencing conducted on small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix worldwide. Analysis of gene expression regulatory networks revealed that the transcription factor TFF3 drived up-regulation of ELF3. Furthermore, our findings indicated that the neuroendocrine marker genes and gene regulatory networks associated with small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma differed from those observed in lung, small intestine, and liver neuroendocrine carcinoma within the GEO database, suggesting tissue-specific origins for these malignancies. Overall, this study addresses a significant research in understanding small cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma in vivo and provides valuable insights for guiding radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy."
39761277,Designing of an mRNA vaccine against high-risk human papillomavirus targeting the E6 and E7 oncoproteins exploiting immunoinformatics and dynamic simulation.,"Human papillomavirus 16 and human papillomavirus 18 have been associated with different life-threatening cancers, including cervical, lung, penal, vulval, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, while cervical cancer is the most prominent one. Several research studies have suggested that the oncoproteins E6 and E7 are the leading cause of cancers associated with the human papillomavirus infection. Therefore, we developed two mRNA vaccines (V1 and V2) targeting these oncoproteins. We used several bioinformatics tools to predict helper T lymphocyte, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, and B-cell epitopes derived from the proteins and assessed their antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Both vaccines were constructed using selected epitopes, linkers, and adjuvants. After that, the vaccines were applied for physicochemical properties, secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and subsequent docking and simulation analyses. Accordingly, vaccine 1 (V1) and vaccine 2 (V2) showed better hydrophilicity with the grand average hydropathicity score of -0.811 and -0.648, respectively. The secondary and tertiary structures of the vaccines were also deemed satisfactory, with high stability indicated by the Ramachandran plot (V1:94.5% and V2:87.1%) and Z scores (V1: -5.15 and V2: -4.1). Docking analysis revealed substantial affinity of the vaccines towards the toll-like receptor-2 (V1: -1159.3, V2: -1246.3) and toll-like receptor-4 (V1: -1109.3, V2: -1244.8) receptors. Molecular dynamic simulation validated structural integrity and indicated varying stability throughout the simulation. Codon optimization showed significant expression of the vaccines (V1:51.88% and V2:51.63%) in E. coli vectors. Furthermore, regarding immune stimulation, the vaccines elicited significant B-cell and T-cell responses, including sustained adaptive and innate immune responses. Finally, thermodynamic predictions indicated stable mRNA structures of the vaccines (V1: -502.60 kcal/mol and V2: -450.90 kcal/mol). The proposed vaccines designed effectively targeting human papillomavirus oncoproteins have demonstrated promising results via robust immune responses, suggesting their suitability for further clinical advancement, including in vitro and in vivo experiments."
39761002,Association of radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity with a high genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis.,"PURPOSE: Overlapping genes are involved with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and DNA repair pathways. Therefore, we hypothesised that patients with a high polygenic risk score (PRS) for RA will have an increased risk of radiotherapy (RT) toxicity given the involvement of DNA repair. METHODS: Primary analysis was performed on 1494 prostate cancer, 483 lung cancer and 1820 breast cancer patients assessed for development of RT toxicity in the REQUITE study. Validation cohorts were available from the Radiogenomics Consortium. All patients had undergone curative-intent radiotherapy and were assessed prospectively for toxicity. Germline genomic data was available for all patients, allowing a PRS to be calculated using 101 RA risk variants. PRS was analysed as a continuous variable and with >90th percentile cut-off. Associations with acute and late standardised total average toxicity (STAT) scores and individual toxicity end-points were analysed in multivariable models with preselected adjustment variables. RESULTS: Increasing PRS for RA did not increase the risk of acute or late STAT in any cohort. There was an increased risk of late oesophagitis in the lung cancer cohort (coefficient 0.018, p = .01), however this was not validated (p = .79). No individual acute or late toxicity endpoints were significantly associated with PRS for the prostate or breast cohorts. No significant results were found in the validation cohorts in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high genetic risk for RA do not show increased levels of toxicity after radiotherapy suggesting treatment planning does not need to be modified for such patients."
39759507,Unveiling the NEFH+ malignant cell subtype: Insights from single-cell RNA sequencing in prostate cancer progression and tumor microenvironment interactions.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease, ranking among the most prevalent malignancies in men. In 2020, there were 1,414,259 new cases of PCa worldwide, accounting for 7.3% of all malignant tumors. The incidence rate of PCa ranks third, following breast cancer and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with high-grade PCa frequently present with existing or developing metastases, complicating their treatment and resulting in poorer prognoses, particularly for those with bone metastases. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified specific malignant cell subtypes that are closely linked to high-grade PCa. By investigating the mechanisms that govern interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), we aim to offer new theoretical insights that can enhance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PCa, ultimately striving to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. METHODS: Data on scRNA-seq was obtained from the GEO database. The gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis were employed to analyze differential expression genes. Using inferCNV analysis to identify malignant epithelial cells. We subsequently employed Monocle, Cytotrace, and Slingshot packages to infer subtype differentiation trajectories. The cellular communication between malignant cell subtypes and other cells was predicted using the CellChat package. Furthermore, we employed pySCENIC to analyze and identify the regulatory networks of transcription factors (TFs) in malignant cell subtypes. The MDA PCa 2b and VCap cell lines were employed to validate the analysis results through cellular functional experiments. In addition, a risk scoring model was developed to assess the variation in clinical characteristics, prognosis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity. RESULTS: A malignant cell subtype in PCa with high expression of NEFH was identified through scRNA-seq analysis. This subtype was situated at the differentiation terminal, exhibited a higher level of malignancy, and exhibited characteristics that were more prone to advanced tumor lesions. In addition, our research underscored the intricate interactions that exist within the TME, particularly the interaction between PTN secreted by this subtype and fibroblasts via the NCL receptor. This interaction may be closely associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor progression. Subsequently, we determined that the NEFH+ malignant cell subtype was significantly correlated with the TF IRX4. This TF is linked to a worse prognosis in PCa and may affect disease progression by regulating gene transcription. Our conclusions were additionally verified through cellular experiments. Furthermore, the prognostic model we developed demonstrated satisfactory predictive performance, with gene sets from the high NmRS group facilitating tumor progression and deterioration. The analysis of immune infiltration was instrumental in the development of clinical intervention strategies and patient prognosis. CONCLUSION: By examining the cellular heterogeneity of a unique NEFH+ malignant cell subtype within the PCa microenvironment, we were able to disclose their reciprocal interaction with disease progression. This offers a novel viewpoint on the diagnosis and treatment of PCa."
39759315,Overexpression of C1orf74 predicts poor outcome and promote cervical cancer progression.,"Cervical cancer (CC), which ranks among the four most common cancers in women, is a leading cause of both illness and death globally. It's urgent to identify a new biomarker to elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying the progression of CC. Here, we screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and selected Chromosome 1 open reading frame 74 (C1orf74) for further investigation. C1orf74 levels were elevated, indicating a link to poor prognosis. Higher expression of C1orf74 was significantly related to clinical stage, T stage, histological type and survival status. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that C1orf74 is likely associated with the MAPK signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that C1orf74 was correlated with multifarious immune cell infiltration. Finally, the knockdown of C1orf74 significantly inhibited the growth of CC in vitro. In conclusion, C1orf74 promotes CC proliferation and progression, is closely associated with poor prognosis, and plays a role in the tumor immune microenvironment. The research indicates that C1orf74 is important for treating CC and may help develop new strategies to improve patient outcomes."
39759304,CENPE is a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cervical cancer.,"Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC) is a common cancer in women. Despite advancements in early diagnosis through high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, challenges remain in predicting and treating the disease. Hence, the identification of novel biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets is crucial. CENPE, a microtubule-end directed motor protein that accumulates during the G2 phase, is recognized for its involvement in promoting cancer growth and progression. However, its specific role in CESC remains unclear. This research investigated the expression of CENPE in CESC utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which was further validated through gene expression profiles, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and clinical data. The study utilized Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis to elucidate the role of CENPE in CESC. Additionally, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) networks involving CENPE and its differentially expressed genes were established. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of CENPE on patient prognosis. Our study revealed an upregulation of CENPE expression in cervical cancer tissues, which promotes the progression of CESC through IL-6-mediated PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. The significant associations with ACNG3, LY6H, and SLC6A7 suggest that CENPE may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis, potentially involving the nervous system. Moreover, the correlations with ARIH1, KDM1A, KDM5B, and NSD3 indicate that CENPE could be a promising target for drug development. Our analysis of the ROC curve demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy of CENPE in CESC (AUC: 0.997, CI: 0.990-1.000). Subgroup analysis highlighted substantial effects in patients under 50 years old, those with a height under 160 cm, individuals in peri- and post-menopausal stages, and patients in clinical stages 1 and 4. Additionally, COX regression analysis indicated that older age, lower BMI, and higher CENPE expression are associated with decreased 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates. In conclusion, CENPE emerges as a crucial factor in the initiation and advancement of cervical cancer, showing potential as a novel target for therapeutic interventions."
39757125,Comprehensive Genome Profiling-Initiated Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Monitoring for Patients With Advanced Cancer.,"In Japan, comprehensive genome profiling (CGP) as a companion diagnostic (CDx) has been covered by public insurance since June 2019, but the proportion of patients with cancer who actually received drug therapy based on CGP data is low. In the present study, we attempted to use CGP as a starting point for tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring. We retrospectively validated 219 patients with malignant tumors who underwent CGP at Iwate Medical University Hospital between October 2019 and April 2023 in terms of patient demographics, genetic analysis, drug recommendations, and drug administration rate. The 219 cancer cases analyzed by CGP for 27 target organs, including prostate (n = 27, 12.3%), colorectal (n = 25, 11.4%), lung (n = 19, 8.7%), and other neoplasms (n = 148, 67.6%). Among the cohort, only 14 cases (6.4%) subsequently were able to undertake the recommended action by Molecular Tumor Board. Of patients who underwent ctDNA monitoring based on somatic mutations identified by CGP (n = 11), clinical validity was confirmed in terms of early relapse prediction (n = 5, 45.5%), treatment response evaluation (n = 10, 90.9%), and no relapse/regrowth corroboration (n = 2, 18.2%) whereas 90.9% (n = 10) of patients obtained information with at least one source of the clinical validity. Although the current rate of CGP contributing to a drug recommendation is low, CGP results can be an alternate resource for tumor-informed longitudinal ctDNA monitoring to provide information concerning early relapse prediction, treatment response evaluation, and no relapse/regrowth corroboration."
39756822,Genome analysis uncovers an inverse correlation between alterations in P21-activated kinases and patient survival across multiple cancer types.,"Cancer is a complex disease with profound societal and economic impacts, especially in metastatic cases where treatment challenges arise due to the absence of reliable biomarkers and effective therapies. While P21-activated kinases (PAKs) play a key role in cancer progression, their potential as predictive markers for metastasis and therapeutic targets has not been fully explored. We hypothesized that genetic alterations in PAK isoforms could be linked to reduced overall patient survival. To investigate this, we used data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, analyzing several randomized, multicentered phase-3 clinical trial datasets. The analysis revealed significant genetic alterations in PAK genes, particularly in cancers such as breast, prostate, pancreatic, and lung. Notably, elevated PAK expression was associated with poorer survival outcomes in prostate and breast cancer patients. In pancreatic and lung cancers, although a trend of poorer survival with PAK alterations was observed, it was not statistically significant. Our findings underscore the importance of PAK isoforms as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, particularly in metastatic cancers. Further research could lead to improved patient outcomes through targeted interventions aimed at PAK-related pathways, with PAK serving as a reliable biomarker for the precise diagnosis, monitoring, and personalization of treatment strategies."
39755693,CXCL8 modulates M0 macrophage proliferation and polarization to influence tumor progression in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CESC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and varied treatment responses. This study identified undifferentiated M0 macrophages as high-risk immune cells critically involved in CESC progression. Co-culture experiments further demonstrated that M0 macrophages significantly promoted HeLa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, underscoring their pivotal role in modulating tumor cell behavior within the TME. A nine-gene prognostic model constructed from immune gene signatures highlighted CXCL8 as a key regulator of M0 macrophage behavior. Functional experiments demonstrated that CXCL8 knockdown in M0 macrophages inhibited their proliferation, shifted polarization toward an M1-dominant phenotype, and reduced tumor-promoting M2 polarization. Co-culture experiments with CXCL8-deficient M0 macrophages further revealed a suppression of HeLa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings position M0 macrophages as central regulators within the TME and suggest that targeting pathways like CXCL8 could provide novel therapeutic strategies for improving outcomes in CESC patients."
39755112,Shared chemoresistance genes in ESCC and cervical Cancer: Insights from pharmacogenomics and Mendelian randomization.,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, particularly the use of platinum-based compounds and taxanes, is pivotal in the treatment of epithelial-derived tumors, such as cervical cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC); however, resistance remains a significant challenge. Utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) with pharmacogenomics offers a novel approach to understanding the genetic underpinnings of drug responses, thereby aiding in personalized treatment. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed a shared cellular subpopulation of CD8 + T effector memory (CD8 + TEM) cells that are pivotal in mediating chemotherapy resistance in ESCC and cervical cancer. A two-sample approach was employed for MR using data from genome-wide association studies, focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to CD8 + TEM cell expression. The SNPs were carefully selected, and statistical models, including the Wald ratio and inverse variance weighted methods, were used for robust causal effect estimation. These were supplemented by MR-Egger and weighted median analyses to address pleiotropy and variant heterogeneity. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and immunohistochemistry assays were used to verify the relationship between the gene and drug sensitivity. RESULTS: Increased proportion of CD8 + TEM cells were observed in resistant samples. MR identified IL32, SPOCK1, and TRBC2 as key genes associated with resistance to cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, respectively. These findings were validated across various cohorts and underscored the role of CD8 + TEM cells in drug responsiveness. The results of the MTT and immunohistochemistry assays confirmed the MR findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the significant role of CD8 + TEM cells in the chemoresistance of ESCC and cervical cancer and identified three genetic markers crucial for resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents. These findings suggest potential pathways for developing personalized treatment strategies, offering clinically relevant insights that could enhance therapeutic efficacy and help overcome drug resistance in patients with ESCC or cervical cancer."
39753527,Vitamin D sensitizes cervical cancer to radiation-induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy through degradation of Ambra1.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is becoming a major health issue globally, and radiotherapy plays a crucial role in its treatment. However, the prognosis of some patients remains poor due to tumor resistance to the therapy. This study aimed to explore whether vitamin D could confer a more radiosensitive phenotype in CC based on our previous findings and detection using the database. We found that vitamin D sensitized vitamin D receptor (VDR)-positive CC cells (Siha and Caski) to the cytotoxic effects of radiation in vivo and in vitro. We examined conventional radiation-induced cell death, such as DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, in vitamin D-treated cells to detect the underlying mechanism, but no association was observed between them. Subsequently, our proteome analysis exhibited that autophagy was reduced in irradiated CCs treated with vitamin D, and apoptosis displayed the opposite effect. Moreover, we confirmed that vitamin D-pretreated irradiated cells displayed reduced autophagy activity mediated by the Ambra1 downregulation, and the elevation of apoptosis was attributed to the activation of caspase 8. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of caspases or the Ambra1 overexpression could restore tumor proliferation under the vitamin D and radiation combination treatment. Hence, the aforementioned findings revealed the essential impact of vitamin D in terms of enhancing radiosensitivity in CC meditated by inhibiting autophagy and proposed the addition of vitamin D as a viable strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of VDR-positive CC."
39752458,"Clonal phylogenies inferred from bulk, single cell, and spatial transcriptomic analysis of epithelial cancers.","Epithelial cancers are typically heterogeneous with primary prostate cancer being a typical example of histological and genomic variation. Prior studies of primary prostate cancer tumour genetics revealed extensive inter and intra-patient genomic tumour heterogeneity. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the inference of ground-truth genomic single-nucleotide and copy number variant status from transcript data. While these inferred SNV and CNV states can be used to resolve clonal phylogenies, however, it is still unknown how faithfully transcript-based tumour phylogenies reconstruct ground truth DNA-based tumour phylogenies. We sought to study the accuracy of inferred-transcript to recapitulate DNA-based tumour phylogenies. We first performed in-silico comparisons of inferred and directly resolved SNV and CNV status, from single cancer cells, from three different cell lines. We found that inferred SNV phylogenies accurately recapitulate DNA phylogenies (entanglement = 0.097). We observed similar results in iCNV and CNV based phylogenies (entanglement = 0.11). Analysis of published prostate cancer DNA phylogenies and inferred CNV, SNV and transcript based phylogenies demonstrated phylogenetic concordance. Finally, a comparison of pseudo-bulked spatial transcriptomic data to adjacent sections with WGS data also demonstrated recapitulation of ground truth (entanglement = 0.35). These results suggest that transcript-based inferred phylogenies recapitulate conventional genomic phylogenies. Further work will need to be done to increase accuracy, genomic, and spatial resolution."
39752185,Systems-level liquid biopsy in advanced prostate cancer.,"Treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) primarily involves suppression of androgen receptor (AR) activity using androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs). While ARSIs have extended patient survival, resistance inevitably develops. Mechanisms of resistance include genomic aberrations at the AR locus that reactivate AR signaling or lineage plasticity that drives emergence of AR-independent phenotypes. Given the diverse mechanisms of ARSI resistance in CRPC, there is a need for more effective monitoring strategies that detect signs of resistance to inform prognosis and guide use of alternative therapies. Liquid biopsy is a blood test that has emerged as a powerful, minimally invasive tool for investigating advanced cancer. In CRPC, liquid biopsy has been shown to reflect genomic and transcriptomic features in tumor tissue and has been utilized to detect an array of resistance signatures. Liquid biopsy is uninhibited by spatial restrictions and allows for longitudinal monitoring of disease progression. However, current clinical liquid biopsy tests provide limited actionable information. This review highlights recent advancements to the understanding of mechanisms driving treatment resistance in CRPC through research-grade liquid biopsy assays. We explore novel methods of disease characterization developed using liquid biopsy and emphasize the clinical potential of a multi-omics molecular profiling approach to comprehensively detect emerging therapeutic resistance. Routine assessment of therapy resistance using a liquid biopsy assay has the potential to enhance prognostication and improve outcomes of men with CRPC."
39751910,Unsupervised clustering reveals noncanonical myeloid cell subsets in the brain tumor microenvironment.,"The tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) of human central nervous system (CNS) tumors remains to be comprehensively deciphered. Here, we employed flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis for a deep data-driven dissection of a diverse TiME and to uncover noncanonical immune cell types in human CNS tumors by using seven tumors from five patients. Myeloid subsets comprised classical microglia, monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils, and two noncanonical myeloid subsets: CD3(+) myeloids and CD19(+) myeloids. T lymphocyte subsets included double-negative (CD4(-) CD8(-)) T cells (DNTs). Noncanonical myeloids and DNTs were explored on independent datasets, suggesting that our DNT phenotype represents gammadelta T cells. Noncanonical myeloids were validated using orthogonal methods across 73 patients from three independent datasets. While the proportions of classical myeloids agreed with reported malignancy type-associated TiMEs, unexpectedly high lymphocyte frequencies were detected in gliosarcoma, which also showed a unique expression pattern of immune-related genes. Our findings highlight the potential of data-driven approaches in resolving CNS TiME to reveal the mosaic of immune cell types constituting TiME, warranting the need for future studies on the nonclassical immune cell subsets."
39749722,KIF18A Is a Novel Target of JNK1/c-Jun Signaling Pathway Involved in Cervical Tumorigenesis.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern. KIF18A, a kinesin motor protein regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis, is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, but its regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates KIF18A's role in cervical cancer and its regulation by the JNK1/c-Jun signaling pathway. Cell growth was assessed in vitro using MTT and colony formation assays, and in vivo using a nude mouse xenograft model with KIF18A knockdown HeLa cells. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal was used to identify KIF18A-related protein kinases in cervical cancer. Western blot analysis was employed to analyze phosphor-c-Jun, c-Jun, and KIF18A expression levels following JNK1 inhibition, c-Jun knockdown/overexpression, and KIF18A knockdown in cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to assess c-Jun binding and transcriptional activity of the KIF18A promoter. KIF18A knockdown significantly impaired cervical cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. A strong positive correlation was observed between JNK1 and KIF18A expression in cervical and other cancers. JNK1 inhibition decreased both KIF18A expression and c-Jun phosphorylation. c-Jun was found to directly bind to and activate the KIF18A promoter. Furthermore, c-Jun knockdown inhibited cervical cancer cell growth, and this effect was partially rescued by KIF18A overexpression. This study demonstrates that the JNK1/c-Jun pathway activates KIF18A expression, which is essential for cervical cancer cell growth. Targeting the JNK/c-Jun/KIF18A axis may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment."
39748655,The clinical utility of circulating human papillomavirus across squamous cell carcinomas.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The similarities in biology, treatment regimens and outcome between the different human papillomavirus (HPV) associated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) allow for extrapolation of results generated from one SC tumor type to another. In HPV associated cancers, HPV is integrated into the tumor genome and can consequently be detected in the circulating fragments of the tumor DNA. Thus, measurement of HPV in the plasma is a surrogate for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and holds promise as a clinically relevant biomarker in HPV associated cancers. With the present overview we aim to present the status of circulating HPV studies in SCCs, the clinical potential and the gaps of knowledge, with the overall aim to facilitate the next steps into clinically relevant prospective trials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the literature and presented the data for each tumor type as well as analyses of the clinical utility across the SCC. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: A total of 41 studies were identified in cervical, head and neck and anal SCC and we discuss the common signals from the results across the different tumor sites. Our results not only confirm the strong clinical potential but also emphasize an urgent need to coordinate studies to allow for relevant sample sizes and statistical validations."
39747449,Analysis of precancerous lesion-related microRNAs for early diagnosis of cervical cancer in the Thai population.,"The incidence rate of cervical cancer (CC) is three times greater in Southeast Asia (SEA), where screening tests are less common than in Northern America, underlining a need for convenient self-diagnostic methods. The expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been considered a molecular tool for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This study aimed at the development of the first miRNA biomarker panel for early detection of CC in Thai women. Genome-wide miRNA expression profiling was performed on cervical tissue and discharge samples from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) subjects. Machine learning was used for handling imbalanced data and feature selection before differential expression analysis to identify significantly dysregulated miRNA panels. Pathway analysis was conducted to provide the cellular functions involved in CC progression. The study identified a shared 18-miRNA panel for both tissue and discharge, with which the prediction model distinguished HSIL and AIS from normal samples with an accuracy of 90.9%. Three dysregulated miRNAs comprised of miR-125b-1-3p, miR-487b-3p, and miR-1180-3p in CC were first described. Most of the miRNAs in the panel were down-regulated, whereas merely miR-142-3p was significantly up-regulated in HSIL and AIS, suggesting a convenient biomarker for detecting precancerous conditions. Moreover, our miRNA panel highlighted important roles played by the cell-cell interaction pathways in CC. Together, our miRNA panel hold promise as a biomarker for the early detection of cervical cancer with cervical discharge, offering the possibility for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools."
39746954,Tumor cell-based liquid biopsy using high-throughput microfluidic enrichment of entire leukapheresis product.,"Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in blood encompass DNA, RNA, and protein biomarkers, but clinical utility is limited by their rarity. To enable tumor epitope-agnostic interrogation of large blood volumes, we developed a high-throughput microfluidic device, depleting hematopoietic cells through high-flow channels and force-amplifying magnetic lenses. Here, we apply this technology to analyze patient-derived leukapheresis products, interrogating a mean blood volume of 5.83 liters from seven patients with metastatic cancer. High CTC yields (mean 10,057 CTCs per patient; range 100 to 58,125) reveal considerable intra-patient heterogeneity. CTC size varies within patients, with 67% overlapping in diameter with WBCs. Paired single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing identifies subclonal patterns of aneuploidy and distinct signaling pathways within CTCs. In prostate cancers, a subpopulation of small aneuploid cells lacking epithelial markers is enriched for neuroendocrine signatures. Pooling of CNV-confirmed CTCs enables whole exome sequencing with high mutant allele fractions. High-throughput CTC enrichment thus enables cell-based liquid biopsy for comprehensive monitoring of cancer."
39746639,A comprehensive analysis-based study of Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)-Environmental explanation of bladder cancer progression.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is widely utilized as a plasticizer in industrial manufacturing to enhance the durability and flexibility of plastics. Studies have depicted that DEHP exposure may be associated with multiple cancers, including colorectal, liver and prostate cancer. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of DEHP on bladder cancer progression remain unspecific. In this work, we explored the correlation between DEHP exposure and bladder cancer through comprehensive analysis. A total of 172 differentially expressed DEHP-related genes (DEDRGs) were screened based on the CTD and TCGA database. In addition, a new prognostic model related to DEHP was developed, which had excellent predictive power for bladder cancer prognoses. Molecular docking techniques were employed to assess the binding affinity of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) to crucial proteins. Lastly, both in vitro and in vivo experiments, along with RNA sequencing, were conducted to elucidate the biological roles and mechanisms of MEHP in bladder cancer. Several new insights into the role of DEHP/MEHP in bladder cancer were given in this study, as well as an awareness of the association between environmental toxicants and cancer progression."
39745472,"Short-term effects of follicle-stimulating hormone on immune function, lipid, and vitamin metabolism in transiently castrated men.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer therapy with surgical or chemical castration with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists has been linked to elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which may contribute to secondary health disorders, including atherosclerosis and diabetes. Although recent findings suggest a role for FSH beyond the reproductive system, its metabolic impact remains unclear and difficult to disentangle from that of androgens. In this study, we examined the metabolic changes induced by FSH and distinguished them from those caused by testosterone. METHODS: Plasma samples from temporarily medically castrated young men (n = 33) treated with FSH and/or testosterone were characterized by proteomics and metabolomics approaches. All subjects received GnRH antagonists. Sixteen men were randomized to recombinant FSH (300 IU 3 times/week) for 5 weeks, while seventeen men served as controls. After 3 weeks, all men received 1000 mg intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. Blood samples were collected at the start, after 3 weeks and after 5 weeks. The proteome and metabolome signatures were characterized in all samples. RESULTS: FSH significantly upregulates key proteins involved in the modulation of inflammatory response and innate immune system (P </= 0.03) and dysregulates lipid metabolism, evidenced by downregulation of multiple apolipoproteins (P </= 0.04) and increased levels of cholesterol and glycerophospholipids (P </= 0.03). In addition, low FSH levels were correlated with a reduction in the active form of vitamin D (P < 0.02). These results highlight the short-term metabolic impacts of FSH in males. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our findings underlined the FSH effect on extragonadal systems and its connection to metabolic disorders often seen as secondary effects of prostate cancer treatment."
39745462,Validation of a simplified HPV genotyping assay designed for cervical screening in low-resource settings.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype predicts cervical cancer risk, and genotyping could help guide the management of HPV positives as part of cervical screening. An isothermal amplification HPV extended genotyping test (ScreenFire HPV RS assay) can assay up to 96 samples/controls in 1 hour plus preparation time. A novel format with pre-aliquoted reagents and an anti-contamination component (Zebra BioDome) could simplify the HPV testing process and reduce the chances of post-amplification contamination. We validated the Zebra BioDome formulation prior to its clinical use. Residual provider-collected cervical samples (n = 450) from a population-based study in rural Nigeria were retested with ScreenFire, once using the standard assay version (liquid reagents combined onsite) and twice with Zebra BioDome. HPV results with adequate DNA (N = 427) were analyzed channel-by-channel and using the cervical cancer risk-based hierarchy of HPV type channels (HPV16, else 18/45, else 31/33/35/52/58, else 39/51/56/59/68, else high-risk HPV negative) to evaluate Zebra BioDome repeatability and accuracy against the standard version. Zebra BioDome reduced the number of pipetting steps to run the ScreenFire HPV assay. Following amplification, the BioDome material formed a sealant layer above the reaction components. Zebra BioDome had excellent repeatability and agreement with the standard version, both at the channel-specific analysis (positive percent agreement between 88.4% [HPV39/51/56/59/68] and 100% [HPV16]; negative percent agreement between 97.8% [HPV31/33/35/52/58] and 100% [HPV39/51/56/59/68]) and hierarchical analysis (overall agreement 97.2%). The assay version utilizing Zebra BioDome performed similarly to the previously validated standard version of the ScreenFire HPV assay and is now undergoing field evaluation. This solution has the potential to reduce assay preparation time and risk of contamination, providing a simpler, low-cost, near-point-of-care HPV testing and extended genotyping solution for cervical screening in lower-resource settings. The potential application of Zebra BioDome technology to other PCR assays should be considered. IMPORTANCE: This work validates a novel pre-packed formulation for the ScreenFire human papillomavirus (HPV) assay, which has the potential to simplify the HPV testing process and to reduce the chances of post-amplification contamination, providing a simpler, low-cost, near-point-of-care HPV testing, and extended genotyping solution for cervical screening in resource-limited settings as part of the ultimate public health goal to accelerate cervical cancer prevention. This technology can also have broad applications for other DNA amplification assays beyond HPV."
39745082,A new effLuc/Kate dual reporter allele for tumor imaging in mice.,"Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are instrumental for modelling local and systemic features of complex diseases, such as cancer. Non-invasive, longitudinal cell detection and monitoring in tumors, metastases and/or the micro-environment is paramount to achieve a better spatiotemporal understanding of cancer progression and to evaluate therapies in preclinical studies. Bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters marking tumor cells or their microenvironment are valuable for non-invasive cell detection and monitoring in vivo. Here, we report the generation of a dual reporter allele allowing simultaneous bioluminescence and fluorescence detection of cells that have undergone Cre-Lox recombination in mice. The single copy knock-in allele in the permissive collagen I locus was evaluated in the context of several cancer GEMMs, where Cre expression was achieved genetically or by ectopic virus-mediated delivery. The new reporter allele was also combined with gene-targeted alleles widely used in bone, prostate, brain and pancreas cancer research, as well as with alleles inserted into the commonly used Rosa26 and collagen I loci. This allele is, therefore, a useful addition to the portfolio of reporters to help advance preclinical research."
39744927,Bioinformatics Based Drug Repurposing Approach for Breast and Gynecological Cancers: RECQL4/FAM13C Genes Address Common Hub Genes and Drugs.,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of breast cancer and gynaecological cancers is high, and these cancer types can occur consecutively as secondary cancers. The aim of our study is to determine the genes commonly expressed in these cancers and to identify the common hub genes and drug components. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene intensity values of breast cancer, gynaecological cancers such as cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancers were used from the Gene Expression Omnibus database Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array project. Using the linear modelling method included in the R LIMMA package, genes that differ between healthy individuals and cancer patients were identified. Hub genes were determined using cytoHubba in Cytoscape program. ""ShinyGo 0.80"" tool was used to determine the disease-specific biological KEGG pathways. Drug.MATADOR from the ShinyGo 0.80 tool was used to predict drug-target relationships. RESULTS: The RecQ Like Helicase 4 and Family with Sequence Similarity 13 Member C genes were found to be similarly expressed in breast cancer and gynaecological cancers. Upon KEGG pathway analyses with hub genes, Drug.MATADOR analysis with hub genes related to cancer related pathways was performed. We have determined these gene/drug interactions: NBN (targeted by Hydroxyurea), EP300 (targeted by Acetylcarnitine) and MAPK14 (targeted by Salicylate and Dibutyryl cyclic AMP). CONCLUSION: The drugs associated with hub genes determined in our study are not routinely used in cancer treatment. Our study offers the opportunity to identify the target genes of drugs used in breast and gynaecological cancers with the drug repurposing approach."
39744075,Investigating the prognostic utility of GSTP1 promoter methylation in prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine the prognostic significance of glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 DNA methylation (mGSTP1) in two independent prostate cancer cohorts with long-term clinical follow-up data. SUBJECTS/PATIENTS AND METHODS: We first re-examined a published, in-house whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) prostate cancer dataset, derived from radical prostatectomy (RP) tissue (n = 15) with median follow-up 19.5 years, to confirm and visualise the association between mGSTP1 and patient mortality. To validate prognostic significance, we used a quantitative methylation-specific head-loop (MS-HL) assay to measure mGSTP1 levels in a larger, independent cohort (n = 186), and performed univariable and multivariable Cox survival analysis. RESULTS: Re-analysis of WGBS data showed a significant increase in mGSTP1 in RP samples from patients with lethal versus non-lethal disease. Subsequent analysis in the larger cohort using the MS-HL assay confirmed that mGSTP1 was detectable in 97% of RP samples, validating the diagnostic potential of mGSTP1. Univariable Cox survival analysis revealed a significant association between mGSTP1 levels and biochemical recurrence and metastatic relapse free survival, with a near-significant association with prostate cancer specific mortality. Notably, multivariable Cox models demonstrated that mGSTP1 did not add independent prognostic value beyond standard clinicopathological features. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the importance of DNA methylation as a tissue-based prostate tumour biomarker. GSTP1 methylation is well established as a diagnostic marker, and in this study, we find that GSTP1 methylation levels are also associated with disease prognosis. Further research is required into the clinical utility of prognostic methylation markers and their functional role in disease progression."
39743630,LKB1 inactivation promotes epigenetic remodeling-induced lineage plasticity and antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer.,"Epigenetic regulation profoundly influences the fate of cancer cells and their capacity to switch between lineages by modulating essential gene expression, thereby shaping tumor heterogeneity and therapy response. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the intricacies behind androgen receptor (AR)-independent lineage plasticity remain unclear, leading to a scarcity of effective clinical treatments. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing on both human and mouse prostate cancer samples, combined with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and multiple genetically engineered mouse models, we investigated the molecular mechanism of AR-independent lineage plasticity and uncovered a potential therapeutic strategy. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human prostate cancers, both pre- and post-androgen deprivation therapy, revealed an association between liver kinase B1 (LKB1) pathway inactivation and AR independence. LKB1 inactivation led to AR-independent lineage plasticity and global DNA hypomethylation during prostate cancer progression. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of TET enzymes and supplementation with S-adenosyl methionine were found to effectively suppress AR-independent prostate cancer growth. These insights shed light on the mechanism driving AR-independent lineage plasticity and propose a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting DNA hypomethylation in AR-independent CRPC."
39742702,Identification and dissection of prostate cancer grounded on fatty acid metabolism-correlative features for predicting prognosis and assisting immunotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Fatty acid metabolism (FAM) plays a critical role in tumor progression and therapeutic resistance by enhancing lipid biosynthesis, storage, and catabolism. Dysregulated FAM is a hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa), enabling cancer cells to adapt to extracellular signals and metabolic changes, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) playing a key role. However, the prognostic significance of FAM in PCa remains unexplored. METHODS: We analyzed 309 FAM-related genes to develop a prognostic model using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. This model stratified PCa patients into high- and low-risk groups and was validated using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We constructed a nomogram incorporating risk score, clinical variables (T and N stage, Gleason score, age), and assessed its performance with calibration curves. The associations between risk score, tumor mutation burden (TMB), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and TME features were also examined. Finally, a hub gene was identified via protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and validated. RESULTS: The risk score was an independent prognostic factor for PCa. High-risk patients showed worse survival outcomes but were more responsive to immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. A core gene with high expression correlated with poor prognosis, unfavorable clinicopathological features, and immune cell infiltration. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the prognostic importance of FAM in PCa, providing novel insights into prognosis and potential therapeutic targets for PCa management."
39741355,Comparison of baseline global gene expression profiles of prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and DU145.,"INTRODUCTION: DU145 and LNCaP are classic prostate cancer cell lines. Characterizing their baseline transcriptomics profiles (without any intervention) can offer insights into baseline genetic features and oncogenic pathways that should be considered while interpreting findings after various experimental interventions such as exogenous gene transfection or drug treatment. METHODS: LNCaP and DU145 cell lines were cultured under normal conditions, followed by RNA extraction, cDNA conversion, library preparation, and RNA sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The sequences were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and for gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment. RESULTS: A total of 3916 and 2301 genes were found to be differentially upregulated and downregulated between LNCaP and DU145 cell lines, respectively. The GO and pathway analysis of up-regulated DEGs indicated significant enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and cell-substrate adhesion, while down-regulated genes are involved in epithelial cell migration, cell death regulation, and cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: The results showed significant differences in baseline gene expression and cellular pathways that may account for the varying metastatic potentials between LNCaP and DU145 cell lines, which should be considered when interpreting findings after experimental interventions."
39741346,Unveiling the molecular profile of a prostate carcinoma: implications for personalized medicine.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common diagnosed tumor and the fifth cancer related death among men in Europe. Although several genetic alterations such as ERG-TMPRSS2 fusion, MYC amplification, PTEN deletion and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 genes play a key role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, specific gene alteration signature that could distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer or may aid in patient stratification for prognosis and/or clinical management of patients with prostate cancer is still missing. Therefore, here, by a multi-omics approach we describe a prostate cancer carrying the fusion of TMPRSS2 with ERG gene and deletion of 16q chromosome arm. RESULTS: We have observed deletion of KDM6A gene, which may represent an additional genomic alteration to be considered for patient stratification. The cancer hallmarks gene signatures highlight intriguing molecular aspects that characterize the biology of this tumor by both a high hypoxia and immune infiltration scores. Moreover, our analysis showed a slight increase in the Tumoral Mutational Burden, as well as an over-expression of the immune checkpoints. The omics profiling integrating hypoxia, ROS and the anti-cancer immune response, optimizes therapeutic strategies and advances personalized care for prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The here data reported can lay the foundation for predicting a poor prognosis for the studied prostate cancer, as well as the possibility of targeted therapies based on the modulation of hypoxia, ROS, and the anti-cancer immune response."
39741285,Spatial transcriptomics reveals unique metabolic profile and key oncogenic regulators of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: As a prevalent and deadly malignant tumor, the treatment outcomes for late-stage patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) are often suboptimal. Previous studies have shown that tumor progression is closely related with tumor metabolism and microenvironment reshaping, with disruptions in energy metabolism playing a critical role in this process. To delve deeper into the understanding of CSCC development, our research focused on analyzing the tumor microenvironment and metabolic characteristics across different regions of tumor tissue. METHODS: Utilizing spatial transcriptomics (ST) sequencing technology, we conducted a study on FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) tumor samples from CSCC patients. Coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data after deconvolution, we described spatial distribution maps of tumor leading edge and core regions in detail. Tumor tissues were classified into hypermetabolic and hypometabolic regions to analyze the metabolism profiles and tumor differentiation degree across different spatial areas. We also employed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to examine the analysis results of ST data. RESULTS: Our findings indicated a more complex tumor microenvironment in hypermetabolic regions. Cell-cell communication analysis showed that various cells in tumor microenvironment were influenced by the signalling molecule APP released by cancer cells and higher expression of APP was observed in hypermetabolic regions. Furthermore, our results revealed the correlation between APP and the transcription factor TRPS1. Both APP and TRPS1 demonstrated significant effects on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially contributing to tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing ST, scRNA-seq, and TCGA database, we examined the spatial metabolic profiles of CSCC tissues, including metabolism distribution, metabolic variations, and the relationship between metabolism and tumor differentiation degree. Additionally, potential cancer-promoting factors were proposed, offering a valuable foundation for the development of more effective treatment strategies for CSCC."
39740915,Low-dose Imatinib Efficacy in a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor Patient With KIT Exon 11 W557_K558 Deletion.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare cancers originating from Cajal's stromal cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common driver mutation in these cancers is the KIT mutation. This report presents a case of response to low-dose imatinib in a patient with GIST harboring KIT exon 11 W557_K558 deletion. CASE REPORT: In June 2023, an 82-year-old male developed perineal pain. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a mass measuring >9 cm, extending from the rectum to the prostate. Submucosal tumor biopsy revealed a tumor with CD117-positive and DOG1-positive spindle-shaped cells leading to a diagnosis of GIST. c-Kit gene mutation analysis detected a W557_K558 deletion in exon 11. Treatment with imatinib (400 mg/day) was initiated in late October 2023 to preserve organ function; the dose was reduced to 300 mg/day after 5 days of treatment and further reduced to 200 mg/day after 10 days, with continued treatment at this dose. The CT performed in January, April, and June 2024 showed that the rectal GIST had shrunk. The blood imatinib concentration remained at approximately 650 ng/ml from January to March 2024 and decreased to 391 ng/ml in May 2024. CONCLUSION: The response rate of GISTs to imatinib is influenced by genetic mutations. GIST with KIT exon 11 W557_K558 deletion is associated with a high risk of recurrence. In vitro data showed that low-dose imatinib was effective in such cases. Low-dose imatinib is a treatment option for patients with GIST harboring KIT exon 11 W557_K558 deletion who are intolerant to high-dose imatinib."
39739214,CYFIP2: potential pancreatic cancer biomarker and immunotherapeutic target.,"OBJECTIVE: It has been shown that the CYFIP2 (Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2) gene is apoptosis p53-dependent and is associated with poor prognosis in malignant tumors such as gastric cancer and other and cervical cancer. However, the prognostic potential of CYFIP2 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this work, we first explain the great potential of CYFIP2 malignant progression from a broader perspective (pan-cancer) and confirm its oncogenic value in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, CELL and GEO databases were utilized to explore the distribution of the CYFIP2 gene in human cancers. Data were analyzed using a variety of web-based platforms and software such as R (4.3.2), UCSC, MethSurv, Cytoscape (v3.10.2), UALAND, STRING, TISIDB, Harmonizome 3.0, TIMER 2.0, TCIA and TIDE. The R packages R packages ?limma? and ?ggplot2? were used to compare and visualize CYFIP2 mRNA expression. The R packages ?survminer? and ?survival? were used to statistically analyze the relationship between CYFIP2 expression and the survival and prognosis of tumor patients. the R package ?ss GSEA? was used to assess the correlation between CYFIP2 expression and immune infiltration. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the multiple biological functions and regulatory pathways in which CYFIP2 co-expressed genes co-engage in pancreatic cancer. The R package ?maftool? was used to explore somatic mutation information in pancreatic cancer, and the TIDE database and the R package ?oncoPredic? were used to explore immunotherapeutic responses and sensitive drugs. Pancreatic cancer cell lines were constructed with the specific expression of CYFIP2 mRNA, and their invasive and metastatic abilities were analysed using scratch and transwell assays. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments confirmed that CYFIP2 was differentially expressed in a variety of tumors and correlated with clinical stage, and could be used as a potential marker for evaluating the prognosis and immunotherapy of a variety of tumors, including KIRC (Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma), PAAD (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma), PAAD (Pancreatic adenocarcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma), and UCEC (Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma).Mutations in the CYFIP2 gene and methylation indices can affect the prognosis of tumor patients. In addition, we found that CYFIP2 expression values in pancreatic cancer were positively correlated with the expression of most immune cells, especially CD8?+?T Cells, and significantly negatively correlated with macrophages M0, and negatively correlated with the metastatic and invasive ability of pancreatic cancer cells, which may provide new strategies and ideas for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy."
39737899,PSCA-targeted BPX-601 CAR T cells with pharmacological activation by rimiducid in metastatic pancreatic and prostate cancer: a phase 1 dose escalation trial.,"Here we report results of a phase 1 multi-institutional, open-label, dose-escalation trial (NCT02744287) of BPX-601, an investigational autologous PSCA-directed GoCAR-T(R) cell product containing an inducible MyD88/CD40 ON-switch responsive to the activating dimerizer rimiducid, in patients with metastatic pancreatic (mPDAC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Primary objectives were to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the recommended phase 2 dose/schedule (RP2D). Secondary objectives included the assessment of efficacy and characterization of the pharmacokinetics of rimiducid. Thirty-three patients received BPX-601 with or without rimiducid, 24 patients with mPDAC and 9 with mCRPC. Two dose-limiting toxicities and two treatment-related deaths occurred in the highest-dose mCRPC cohort, after which the study was terminated, without determination of the RP2D. Two mCRPC patients experienced partial responses (one unconfirmed), and 56% of mCRPC patients achieved >/=50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen. BPX-601 cell expansion, long-term persistence in peripheral blood, and tumor infiltration were observed. Rimiducid increased circulating inflammatory cytokines/chemokines consistent with GoCAR-T(R) cell activation. These results suggest that pharmacological activation of GoCAR-T(R) cells is feasible and may offer a promising avenue to control chimeric antigen receptor-T cell activity with continued dose-optimization to improve tolerability."
39736751,Silencing of STEAP3 suppresses cervical cancer cell proliferation and migration via JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3), an essential constituent of the STEAP family protein, plays a notable role in promoting cancer proliferation and metastasis. Despite the importance of the STEAP gene family in tumor progression, the function of STEAP3 in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of STEAP3 protein in CC tissues and cell lines was identified using immunohistochemistry. The Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used to detect global gene DNA methylation in CC tissues and paracancerous tissues. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), wound repair assay, and transwell assay, respectively. RNA sequencing was applied to explore STEAP3-related signaling pathways. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression of related proteins, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling markers. RESULTS: Herein, STEAP3 was strongly expressed in CC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. CC samples exhibited lower levels of STEAP3 methylation than normal samples, and the methylation levels of CpG islands in STEAP3 were association with prognosis. In contrast to control group, STEAP3 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and invasion of CC cells and enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin. Silencing of STEAP3 led to reduced N-cadherin and vimentin levels and increased E-cadherin expression. RNA sequencing analysis suggested that STEAP3 mediated the activation of the JAK STAT3 signaling pathway. Additionally, inhibition of STEAP3 decreased the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Interestingly, colivelin (a STAT3 activator) modified STEAP3-induced cell proliferation, invasion, and expression of related proteins in the EMT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: STEAP3 was significantly associated with CC progression mediated via the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and may serve as an effective therapeutic target."
39735675,TMED3 promotes prostate cancer via FOXO1a and FOXO3a phosphorylation.,"BACKGROUND: Transmembrane emp24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3) is associated with the development of several tumors; however, whether TMED3 regulates the progression of prostate cancer remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Short hairpin RNA was performed to repress TMED3 in prostate cancer cells (DU145 cells) and in a prostate cancer mice model to determine its function in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In the present study, we found that TMED3 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cells. In vitro, shTMED3 treatment suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration and promoted the apoptosis of DU145 cells. Additionally, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis showed a strong correlation between TMED3 and forkhead box O transcription factor (FOXO) pathway. Furthermore, TMED3 inhibition efficiently decreased FOXO1a and FOXO3a phosphorylation. In vivo, TMED3 downregulation suppressed the apoptosis, growth, and metastasis of prostate cancer cells via FOXO1a and FOXO3a. CONCLUSION: The present findings show that TMED3 participates in the regulation of prostate cancer progression via FOXO1a and FOXO3a phosphorylation, thereby revealing a novel mechanism underlying prostate cancer development and suggesting that TMED3 inhibition may serve as a novel strategy for prostate cancer treatment."
39734237,Targeting AURKA with multifunctional nanoparticles in CRPC therapy.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) presents significant therapeutic challenges due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. Targeting Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) has shown promise in cancer treatment. This study investigates the efficacy of ART-T cell membrane-encapsulated AMS@AD (CM-AMS@AD) nanoparticles (NPs) in a photothermal-chemotherapy-immunotherapy combination for CRPC. Bioinformatics analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas-prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset revealed overexpression of AURKA in PCa, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database showed a significant reduction in immune cells in CRPC. Experimentally, T cell membrane-biomimetic NPs loaded with the AURKA inhibitor Alisertib and chemotherapy drug DTX were synthesized and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, showing good stability and uniformity (average diameter: 158 nm). In vitro studies demonstrated that these NPs inhibited CRPC cell proliferation, increased the G2/M cell population, and elevated apoptosis, confirmed by gammaH2AX expression. In vivo, CM-AMS@AD NPs accumulated in tumor tissues, significantly slowed tumor growth, decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and improved the immune environment, enhancing dendritic cell (DC) maturation and increasing CD8 + /CD4 + ratios. These findings suggest that CM-AMS@AD NPs offer a promising triple-combination therapy for CRPC, integrating photothermal, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, with significant potential for future clinical applications."
39733438,Proteomic Analysis of Anticancer Effect of Myo-inositol in Human Prostate Cancer (DU-145) Cell Line.,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the potential anticancer properties of Myo-inositol on the DU-145 prostate cancer cell line. METHODS: The DU-145 cells have been treated to different doses of Myo-inositol in order to ascertain the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The impact of Myo-inositol on proteomic profiles was evaluated using 2D gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). RESULTS: Myo-inositol significantly reduced DU-145 cell viability with an IC50 of 0.06 mg/ml (p<0.05). Proteomic analysis highlighted marked differences in protein expression between treated and untreated cells, particularly in proteins related to cytoskeletal regulation, apoptosis, and stress response. LC-MS further identified significant alterations in protein profiles, with suppression of proteins like Annexin A2 and Cofilin-1-A in controls, and upregulation of proteins such as Rho GTPase-activating protein, Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in treated samples (p<0.001), indicating modulation of key signaling pathways involved in tumor suppression and oncogenesis. CONCLUSION: Myo-inositol exhibits anticancer properties in prostate cancer cells by impacting cell viability and altering protein expression. While promising as an adjunctive treatment, further studies are needed to understand its mechanisms and potential in combination therapies for managing CRPC."
39733409,Effect of NQO1 Downregulation on the Migration and Invasion of HPV16-Positive Cervical Cancer Cells.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify upregulated genes in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells and investigate the impact of downregulating NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) on the survival of these cells. METHODS: Transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to pinpoint upregulated genes and associated cancer-related pathways in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells, comparing them to HPV-negative cervical cancer cells. NQO1 gene knockdown was performed in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell lines to assess its effect on cell survival, including parameters such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and the expression of key proteins in the PI3K/AKT pathway, p53, and RECK. RESULTS: Genes with a fold change >/=4.0 in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell lines were predominantly localized to the extracellular region and plasma membrane. These genes were involved in protein binding and cell adhesion, influencing cellular responses to stimuli and tissue development. KEGG pathway analysis identified the most significant pathways, including metabolic pathways, cancer pathways, MAPK signaling, and PI3K-AKT signaling. Knockdown of NQO1 significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while increasing apoptosis in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells (p </= 0.01). Additionally, proteins associated with the PI3K-AKT pathway were downregulated, while p53 and RECK protein levels were elevated. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that NQO1 plays a crucial role in promoting migration and invasion in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target."
39732766,Accelerated growth and local progression of radiorecurrent prostate cancer in an orthotopic bioluminescent mouse model.,"Globally, prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in males, with over 400 thousand men dying from the disease each year. A common treatment modality for localized prostate cancer is radiotherapy. However, up to half of high-risk patients can relapse with radiorecurrent prostate cancer, the aggressive clinical progression of which remains severely understudied. To address this, we have established an orthotopic mouse model for study that recapitulates the aggressive clinical progression of radiorecurrent prostate cancer. Radiorecurrent DU145 cells which survived conventional fraction (CF) irradiation were orthotopically injected into the prostates of athymic nude mice and monitored with bioluminescent imaging. CF tumours exhibited higher take rates and grew more rapidly than treatment-naive parental tumours (PAR). Pathohistological analysis revealed extensive seminal vesicle invasion and necrosis in CF tumours, recapitulating the aggressive progression towards locally advanced disease exhibited by radiorecurrent tumours clinically. RNA sequencing of CF and PAR tumours identified ROBO1, CAV1, and CDH1 as candidate targets of radiorecurrent progression associated with biochemical relapse clinically. Together, this study presents a clinically relevant orthotopic model of radiorecurrent prostate cancer progression that will enable discovery of targets for therapeutic intervention to improve outcomes in prostate cancer patients."
39730969,Human brain aging is associated with dysregulation of cell type epigenetic identity.,"Significant links between aging and DNA methylation are emerging from recent studies. On the one hand, DNA methylation undergoes changes with age, a process termed as epigenetic drift. On the other hand, DNA methylation serves as a readily accessible and accurate biomarker for aging. A key missing piece of information, however, is the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and how they are related, if any. Addressing the limitations of previous research due to the limited number of investigated CpGs and the heterogeneous nature of tissue samples, here, we have examined DNA methylation of over 20 million CpGs across a broad age span in neurons and non-neuronal cells, primarily oligodendrocytes. We show that aging is a primary predictor of DNA methylation variation, surpassing the influence of factors such as sex and schizophrenia diagnosis, among others. On the genome-wide scale, epigenetic drift manifests as significant yet subtle trends that are influenced by the methylation level of individual CpGs. We reveal that CpGs that are highly differentiated between cell types are especially prone to age-associated DNA methylation alterations, leading to the divergence of epigenetic cell type identities as individuals age. On the other hand, CpGs that are included in commonly used epigenetic clocks tend to be those sites that are not highly cell type differentiated. Therefore, dysregulation of epigenetic cell type identities and current DNA epigenetic clocks represent distinct features of age-associated DNA methylation alterations."
39730631,STEAP3 is a potential preliminary prognostic biomarker of glioblastoma.,"Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3), a member of the iron regulation protein family, is characterized by a high recurrence rate and a short survival time. Nevertheless, studies investigating the role of STEAP3 in glioblastoma (GB) are scarce. In this study, the prognostic value of STEAP3 was evaluated utilizing mRNA expression profiles from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases as the validation and training cohorts, respectively. Moreover, differentially expressed genes were subjected to a functional enrichment analysis. The relationship between STEAP3 and the tumor microenvironment (TME) was examined. The immunophenoscore (IPS) and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score were used to investigate response to immunotherapy. In all cohorts, GB patients with higher STEAP3 expression levels exhibited shorter overall survival (OS). Additionally, STEAP3-associated genes were primarily implicated in leukocyte migration, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. In the STEAP3 high-expression group, the ESTIMATEScore, ImmuneScore, StromalScore, and IPS were significantly higher. Overall, our results highlighted that STEAP3 might serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker for GB. Additionally, it might regulate the TME and influence GB metastasis."
39730177,G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1 (GPER1) Regulates Expression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 and Inhibits Tumorigenic Potential of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells In Vitro.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) appears to play a tumor-suppressive role in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC)GPER1 suppression leads to significantly increased expression of serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1)/protein plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The question arises, what role does SERPINE1/PAI-1 play in GPER1-dependent tumorigenic potential of CSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SiHa and C33A CSCC cells were treated with GPER1 agonist G1 or antagonist G36. SERPINE1/PAI-1 expression was suppressed by RNAi and success was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of PAI-1 was quantified by Western blot. Viability was analyzed using resazurin assay, while migration was investigated using gap closure. Colony and tumor sphere formation were used to test clonogenicity. RESULTS: After G1 treatment, viability of SiHa and C33A cells remained unchanged. Cell migration was dose-dependently reduced. SiHa and C33A cells formed significantly fewer and smaller colonies as well as spheroids. Furthermore, treatment with G1 led to decreased expression of SERPINE1/PAI-1, while blockade of GPER1 with G36 resulted in significantly increased SERPINE1/PAI-1 expression. After suppression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 in SiHa cells using RNAi, cell viability remained unaffected; however, significantly smaller colonies were formed, and fewer and smaller spheroids were developed. Cell migration remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: Activation of GPER1 reduces clonogenicity and migration of CSCC cells and suppresses expression of SERPINE1/PAI-1. Suppression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 in CSCC cells reduces tumorigenic potential. GPER1 may be a suitable target for suppression of SERPINE1/PAI-1 in CSCC. However, SERPINE1/PAI-1 does not appear to be the decisive factor for GPER1-regulated cell migration."
39730174,"RFC3 Knockdown Decreases Cervical Cancer Cell Proliferation, Migration and Invasion.","BACKGROUND/AIM: Replication factor C subunit 3 (RFC3) is a critical component of the replication factor C complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair. Recent studies have highlighted the RFC3's significance in various cancer types. Herein, we aimed to elucidate its biological role in cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cervical cancer cells were transfected with RFC3 or control siRNA. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay over a 4-day period and its clonogenic potential was determined using colony formation assays. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate cell cycle distribution. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to assess the migration and invasion abilities of cervical cancer cells. RESULTS: RFC3 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell-cycle arrest, and decreased migration and invasion in HeLa and ME-180 cells compared to control siRNA-transfected cells. CONCLUSION: The crucial role of RFC3 in cervical cancer progression is highlighted. RFC3 knockdown resulted in decreased cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cervical cancer."
39730086,Prostate luminal cell plasticity and cancer.,"Cellular plasticity in prostate cancer promotes treatment resistance. Several independent studies have used mouse models, single-cell RNA sequencing, and genetic lineage tracing approaches to characterize cellular differentiation and plasticity during prostate organogenesis, homeostasis and androgen-mediated tissue regeneration. We review these findings and recent work using immune-competent genetically-engineered mouse models to characterize cellular plasticity and clonal dynamic changes during prostate cancer progression. Collectively these studies highlight the influence of the tumor microenvironment and the function of epigenetic regulators in promoting cellular plasticity. How the epigenetic alternations that promote cell plasticity affect tumor immunogenicity remains an active area of research with implications for disease treatment."
39727992,Integration of Genomic Tests in Prostate Cancer Care: Implications for Clinical Practice and Patient Outcomes.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common malignancy in men and is among the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Genomic tests assess disease aggressiveness and guide treatment, particularly in low- and intermediate-risk PCa. We reviewed the literature on the use of four genomic tests (Prolaris((R)), Promark((R)), Oncotype DX((R)), and Decipher((R))) in assessing the prognosis of PCa and their use in treatment decision-making. Most of the studies showed that Prolaris((R)) has a strong correlation with biochemical recurrence, metastasis risk, PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), and pathological features. Similarly, three studies on Promark((R)) indicated a connection between results and pathological features in the subsequent prostatectomy, time to metastasis, and biochemical recurrence. Fourteen studies on Oncotype DX((R)) showed a clear correlation between high scores, death, and PCSM. One study found that routine biopsy pathology reports, combined with serum PSA levels, provide a risk assessment comparable to Oncotype DX((R)) testing. Results from 22 studies on Decipher((R)) were controversial. The test was associated with conservative management, suggesting that patients with a high GC score are more likely to need radiation after surgery. Comparative studies indicated that Oncotype DX((R)) is preferable for assessing PCSM, Decipher((R)) for predicting metastasis, and Prolaris((R)) for predicting recurrence. With the incidence rate of PCa dramatically increasing, genomic tests appear to be useful adjunctive precision medicine tools with significant potential in improving prognostic discrimination, facilitating better risk stratification, and guiding personalized treatment, especially in the intermediate-risk patient group. Large-scale, prospective, multi-sectional studies are required to validate the utility of these tests prior to their integration into clinical practice."
39725442,Night shift work and prostate cancer: a large cohort study from UK Biobank and Mendelian randomisation study.,"OBJECTIVE: The global concern regarding the health implications of night shift work has escalated. Nevertheless, variations exist in the observed association between night shift work and prostate cancer (PCa). This study aims to systematically explore the association between night shift work and the risk of PCa. DESIGN: Cohort study and Mendelian randomisation (MR) study were used. SETTING: Cohort study data was from the UK Biobank (UKB). MR study using data was from the Finngen study and UKB through the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) Open Genome-Wide Association Study Project. PARTICIPANTS: Participants without prior PCa in paid employment or self-employment were include in the current work schedule cohort, participants without PCa who provided employment history formed the lifetime night shift work cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome, incident PCa, was obtained from cancer register through linkage to national cancer databases. National cancer registries centralised information received from separate regional cancer centres around the UK. RESULTS: A total of 130 853 participants were included in the current work schedule cohort, while the lifetime night shift work cohort comprised 49 511 participants. Over a median follow-up duration of 13.9 years, the current work schedule cohort witnessed 4993 incident cases of PCa, while the lifetime night shift work cohort recorded 2022 PCa cases. In the analysis of the current work schedule, final model showed that no significant association was found between shift work and PCa risk, whether it involved shift but no night shifts (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08), some night shifts (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33) and usual night shifts (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19). In the analysis of the average frequency of night shift work, final model showed no significant impact of different night shift frequencies (<3/month: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 3-8/month: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.19; >8/month: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.07) on the risk of PCa. No significant association was found for either <10 years (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.09) or >/=10 years (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16) of night shift work. Subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results without significant alterations. Furthermore, in the two-sample MR analysis, no statistically significant causal relationship was identified between night shift work and the incidence of PCa. CONCLUSION: In both the cohort studies and MR analysis, our investigation did not find any association between night shift work and PCa."
39723625,Multi-Omics Study Reveals Nc886/vtRNA2-1 as a Positive Regulator of Prostate Cancer Cell Immunity.,"Noncoding RNA 886 has emerged as a pivotal regulatory RNA with distinct functions across tissues, acting as a regulator of protein activity by directly binding to protein partners. While it is well recognized as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. To discover the principal pathways regulated by nc886 in prostate cancer, we used a transcriptomic and proteomic approach analyzing malignant DU145, LNCaP, PC3, and benign RWPE-1 prostate cell line models transiently transfected with in vitro transcribed nc886 or antisense oligonucleotides. Multiomics revelead a significant enrichment of immune system-related pathways across the cell lines, including cytokines and interferon signaling. The interferon response provoked by nc886 was validated by functional assays. The invariability of PKR phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activity in the gain/loss of nc886 function experiments and the positive regulation of innate immunity suggest a PKR-independent mechanism of nc886 action. Accordingly, the GSEA of the PRAD-TCGA data set revealed immune stimulation as the nc886 most associated node also in the clinical setting. Our study showed that the reduction of nc886 leads to a blunted immune response in prostate cancer."
39722067,"Gallstones, cholecystectomy, and cancer risk: an observational and Mendelian randomization study.","This study aimed to comprehensively examine the association of gallstones, cholecystectomy, and cancer risk. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to estimate the observational associations of gallstones and cholecystectomy with cancer risk, using data from a nationwide cohort involving 239 799 participants. General and gender-specific two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was further conducted to assess the causalities of the observed associations. Observationally, a history of gallstones without cholecystectomy was associated with a high risk of stomach cancer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-4.28), liver and bile duct cancer (aOR=2.46, 95% CI 1.17-5.16), kidney cancer (aOR=2.04, 95% CI 1.05-3.94), and bladder cancer (aOR=2.23, 95% CI 1.01-5.13) in the general population, as well as cervical cancer (aOR=1.69, 95% CI 1.12-2.56) in women. Moreover, cholecystectomy was associated with high odds of stomach cancer (aOR=2.41, 95% CI 1.29-4.49), colorectal cancer (aOR=1.83, 95% CI 1.18-2.85), and cancer of liver and bile duct (aOR=2.58, 95% CI 1.11-6.02). MR analysis only supported the causal effect of gallstones on stomach, liver and bile duct, kidney, and bladder cancer. This study added evidence to the causal effect of gallstones on stomach, liver and bile duct, kidney, and bladder cancer, highlighting the importance of cancer screening in individuals with gallstones."
39721245,Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations in prostate cancer: Implications for prognosis and immunotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer stands as the second most common malignancy among men, notorious for its intricate heterogeneity, especially evident in metastatic disease. This complexity presents substantial challenges in treatment efficacy and patient prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study endeavors to elucidate the multifaceted roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts within the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer, with a focus on their implications for disease prognosis and the potential for novel immunotherapeutic strategies. METHODS: Leveraging advanced single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we meticulously characterized the diverse CAF subpopulations within prostate cancer samples. Our analysis identified four predominant subsets: C0 IER2+, C1 ABCA8+, C2 ABI3BP+, and C3 MEOX2+. We conducted comprehensive gene expression profiling to construct a robust prognostic model reflecting the clinical relevance of these subpopulations. RESULTS: C1 ABCA8+ fibroblasts demonstrated heightened proliferative activity, underscoring their pivotal role in fostering tumor growth and metastasis via intricate signaling pathways. In vitro experiments verified that the T transcription factor NFAT5 of C1 ABCA8+ fibroblasts subpopulation was knocked down in LNCaP clone FGC and 22Rv1 cell lines, which was closely related to the proliferation of PC. Moreover, we identified key genes linked to patient outcomes and immune landscape alterations, reinforcing the prognostic significance of CAF characteristics in this context. CONCLUSION: This investigation illuminates the critical potential of targeting CAFs to augment immunotherapeutic approaches in prostate cancer. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the TME's complexity, advocating for further exploration into CAF-targeted therapies aimed at enhancing treatment responses and ultimately improving patient outcomes."
39719436,Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of radioresistant prostate and head and neck cancers implicate a BAHD1-dependent modification of DNA damage at the heterochromatin.,"Radiotherapy is an integral modality in treating human cancers, but radioresistance remains a clinical challenge due to the involvement of multiple intrinsic cellular and extrinsic tumour microenvironment factors that govern radiosensitivity. To study the intrinsic factors that are associated with cancer radioresistance, we established 4 radioresistant prostate (22Rv1 and DU145) and head and neck cancer (FaDu and HK1) models by irradiating their wild-type parentals to 90 Gy, mimicking the fractionated radiotherapy schema that is often using in the clinic, and performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of the radioresistant and wild-type models. Comparative genomic analyses detected the enrichment of mismatch repair mutational signatures (SBS6, 14, 15, 20) across all the cell lines and several non-synonymous single nucleotide variants involved in pro-survival pathways. Despite significant inter-cell type heterogeneity of their transcriptomic profiles, 18 common dysregulated genes (5 upregulated and 13 downregulated) were identified across the 4 models, including the overexpression of bromo-adjacent homology domain containing 1 (BAHD1) gene, which is involved in heterochromatin formation. Interestingly, this coincided with our observation of increased histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) expression post-irradiation in our radioresistant cells. The dependency between BAHD1 and heterochromatin formation was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of BAHD1, indicating preferential reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 expression in the radioresistant cells, but not the wild-type parentals, and confirmed by clonogenic assays showing reversal of radioresistance post-siBAHD1 treatment. We further showed that inhibition of the BAHD1-heterochromatin formation axis led to reduced DNA double-strand break repair. Finally, analyses of treatment outcomes in 4 prostate and head and neck cancer radiotherapy cohorts suggested an increased risk of failures in tumours of high heterochromatin activity. Taken together, our results support a new model implicating BAHD1-dependent modulation of the heterochromatin in acquired radioresistance of prostate and head and neck cancers."
39716888,An evaluation of talazoparib plus enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer diagnosis among men worldwide, with poor prognosis in its advanced stage. Treatment strategies have evolved, including the use of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). AREAS COVERED: This review evaluates the clinical efficacy, safety, and future potential of combining talazoparib, a potent PARPi, with enzalutamide, a strong androgen receptor (AR) antagonist. The combination of these two drugs was evaluated by the TALAPRO-2 trial, demonstrating significant improvement in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, particularly those with Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) gene mutations such as BRCA1/2. EXPERT OPINION: Emerging biomarkers like TMPRSS2-ERG and RB1 gene mutations have been recently reported as potential predictors of clinical outcome in the TALAPRO-2 all-comers population. Genomic markers for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) are other potential drivers of response to PARPi/ARPI combination. Further investigation is needed to refine treatment strategies, including targeting non-HRR mutations, and to expand the role of this combination therapy in earlier stages of prostate cancer."
39715959,Nuclear receptor profiling for subtype classification and as prognostic markers in 33 cancer types.,"Nuclear receptors, a group of 48 transcription factors that regulate a multitude of processes within our body, have long been employed as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Unfortunately, no comprehensive investigation has been conducted on their significance in other cancer types. The current study aimed to explore novel diagnostic markers by classifying nuclear receptors according to their expression patterns based on transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas on 10,071 tumor samples across 33 cancer types and investigating their association with genetic mutations, histological types, and prognosis. Our analysis showed that 21 cancers, including breast cancer, can be classified into distinct clusters based on their nuclear receptor expression profiles. Moreover, significant differences in overall survival were observed in 9 of the 21 cancer types. Overall, the results of this study indicate that previously overlooked nuclear receptors, such as NR0B1 in lung adenocarcinoma, may prove beneficial in the diagnosis of several cancers."
39708219,Geneticsbiologiesingle cell and expression analysis for erectile dysfunction and cervical cancer targets.,"BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction and cervical cancer are genetically and molecularly two complex health problems. Here, we integrate genetic inference and single-cell expression analysis to identify potential genetic targets for sexual dysfunction and cervical cancer, and assess causality of these targets utilizing Mendelian randomization approaches. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with sexual dysfunction and cervical cancer. Next, we examined the cellular landscape of these variation regions based on scRNAseq data. RESULTS: The study identified several genetic variants that are correlated with sexual dysfunction and cervical cancer, respectively, and these differentially expressed in reproductive and cervical cells. Two-Gene Combination Panel Increased expression of the WISP1 gene was detected in cervical cancer tissues. Twas most highly expressed in T cells, and least well- when cells were proliferating. CONCLUSIONS: The study integrates genetics with single-cell expression to nominate genetic targets for sexual dysfunction and cervical cancer and establishes causal support from Mendelian randomization approach."
39707734,"[Human papillomaviruses : origin, oncogenic factors and markers for cervical cancer screening].","The Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have existed in the human population since the archaic hominids. Over the course of human migration and evolution, HPVs have co-evolved with humans on all continents to become today the leading cause of cervical cancer. HPVs are classified by genera, species, genotype, lineage, sub-lineage and variants. Among more than 200 HPV genotypes, HPV16 is the most common and the most oncogenic at high-risk (HPV-HR). If viral oncogenesis is governed by numerous factors and mechanisms involving the virus and its host, the E6/E7 oncogenic proteins of HR-HPV play a central role and are always expressed in cervical cancers. Those of HPV16 have the greatest affinity for cellular proteins involved in cellular control, p53/E6 and pRb/E7. Some E6/E7 HPV16 mutants are associated with persistent infection, correlating with viral lineages and their ethnic and geographical origin. If the splicing of viral mRNAs encoding E6/E7 allows the overexpression of the E7 protein, which is an essential condition for the establishment of HR-HPV oncogenesis, other mechanisms contribute to strengthening it. On the one hand, the accidental integration of the viral genome, in particular the E1/E2 coding region, participates in the transformation of the infected cell. On the other hand, hypermethylation of the viral L1/L2 genomic regions is observed in the advanced stages of infection. Different methods for analyzing mutations, splice sites, integrations and methylations of the viral genome have been described. These virological markers could complete the detection of HR-HPV in the context of cervical cancer screening, currently recommended in France."
39706698,Risks of grade reclassification among patients with Gleason grade group 1 prostate cancer and PI-RADS 5 findings on prostate MRI.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As most Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 5 lesions on MRI harbor Gleason grade (GG) group >/=2 disease on biopsy, optimal management of patients with imaging-biopsy discordance remains unclear. To estimate grade misclassification, we evaluated the incidence of Gleason upgrading among patients with GG1 disease in the setting of a PI-RADS 5 lesion. METHODS: We conducted a single-institution retrospective analysis to identify patients with GG1 prostate cancer on fusion biopsy with MRI demonstrating >/=1 PI-RADS 5 lesion. Primary study outcome was identification of >/=GG2 disease on subsequent active surveillance (AS) biopsy or radical prostatectomy (RP). We used multivariable models to examine factors associated with reclassification. RESULTS: We identified 110 patients with GG1 disease on initial biopsy and >/=1 PI-RADS 5 lesion. There were 104 patients (94.6%) initially managed with AS and 6 (5.5%) received treatment. Sixty-one patients (58.7%) on AS underwent additional biopsies. Of these, 43 (70.5%) patients had tumor upgrading, with 32 (74.4%) upgraded on first surveillance biopsy. Forty-four (40%) patients ultimately received treatment, including prostatectomy in 15 (13.6%) and radiation in 25 (22.7%). Two patients (1.8%) developed metastases. In multivariable models, genomic classifier score was associated with upgrading. Limitations include a lack of multi-institutional data and long-term outcomes data. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients diagnosed with GG1 prostate cancer on MRI-Ultrasound fusion biopsy in the setting of a PI-RADS 5 lesion were found to have >/=GG2 disease on subsequent tissue sampling, suggesting substantial initial misclassification and reinforcing the need for confirmatory testing."
39706050,NSC-3852 synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of olaparib in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"The PARP inhibitor olaparib is an anti-cancer agent based on synthetic lethality that targets poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases. It is used as a therapeutic agent for breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers carrying BRCA1/2 mutations that cause deficiency in homologous recombination. In recent years, acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors has become a clinical problem in PARP inhibitor-treated patients. Meanwhile, the development of molecular targeted drugs for highly malignant oral cancers has not progressed, and effective treatment strategies are needed. In this study, we identified the histone deacetylase inhibitor NSC-3852 as a compound that synergistically enhances the effects of olaparib in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine treatment partially recovered cell survival after co-treatment with olaparib and NSC-3852. Moreover, the combination of olaparib and NSC-3852 rapidly upregulated gammaH2AX at 2 h after treatment, and induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis at 24 h after treatment, suggesting that this combination induced apoptosis through accumulation of massive DNA damage. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NSC-3852 is a sensitizer of olaparib and suggest that the combination of NSC-3852 and olaparib may be a useful therapeutic strategy for homologous recombination-proficient cancers, including cancers with acquired resistance to olaparib and high-grade oral squamous cell carcinoma."
39703688,NUF2 is associated with cancer stem cell characteristics and a potential drug target for prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells are characterized by self-renewal, clonal tumor initiation capacity, and treatment resistance, which play essential roles in the tumor progression of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we aim to explore the features of cancer stemness and characterize the expression of stem cell-related genes for PCa. METHODS: We downloaded RNA-seq data and related clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) was analyzed for various clinical features, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS), and a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify crucial gene modules and key genes, which may play a role in CSCs. The key gene functions were verified using multiple databases, including the TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Next, we explored the potential function of the modules and genes obtained using WGCNA using an enrichment analysis. Finally, we performed in vitro experiments for further verification. RESULTS: We found that mRNAsi were higher in PCa tissues than in normal tissues, and the mRNAsi were closely related to the clinical characteristics of PCa. A total of 16 key genes associated with the mRNAsi scores were identified by WGCNA analysis, including NCAPG, NEK2, DLGAP5, CENPA, CENPF, TPX2, GTSE1, KIF4A, NEIL3, CDC25C, UBE2C, CDCA5, MELK, SKA3, NUF2, and BIRC5. These genes were explicitly highly expressed in PCa across TCGA cancers and were validated in 3 independent GEO PCa datasets. The functional annotations of the key genes were linked with the cell proliferation processes. NUF2 may be a potential biomarker for PCa. In vitro experiments showed that knockdown NUF2 reduced the proliferation and migration of PCa cells. CONCLUSION: The 16 key genes identified in this study significantly correlate with PCa stem cell characteristics and showed prognosis-oriented effects in PCa patients. Further, the NUF2 gene may be used as a drug target for treating PCa."
39703140,Comparative Analysis of the Therapeutic Potential of Extracellular Vesicles Secreted by Aged and Young Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Osteoarthritis Pathogenesis.,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disease, burdens global healthcare due to aging and obesity. Recent studies show that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) contribute to joint homeostasis and OA management. However, the impact of donor age on BMSC-derived EV efficacy remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated EV efficacy from young BMSCs (2-month-old) in mitigating OA, contrasting them with EVs from aged BMSCs (27-month-old). The study used destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery on mouse knee joints to induce accelerated OA. Cartilage degeneration markers and senescence markers' expression levels were investigated in response to EV treatment. The therapeutic impact of EVs on chondrocytes under inflammatory responses was also evaluated. Despite having similar morphologies, EVs from young BMSCs markedly decreased senescence and improved chondroprotection by activating the PTEN pathway while simultaneously suppressing the upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathways, proving to be more effective than those from older BMSCs in vitro. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injections of EVs from young donors significantly mitigated OA progression by preserving cartilage and reducing synovitis in a surgical OA model using DMM in mice. These findings highlight that donor age as a critical determinant in the therapeutic potential of BMSC-derived EVs for clinical use in OA treatment."
39702187,BRCA2 germline mutation carrier with five malignancies: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: BRCA2 germline mutations are known to predispose carriers to various cancer types, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer. An association with melanoma has also been reported. However, the full tumour spectrum associated with BRCA2 mutations, particularly in patients with other concurrent pathogenetic mutations, is unexplored. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 70-year-old female patient with a pathogenic BRCA2 c.5946del variant. Over a period of 15 years, she has developed two independent breast cancers, well-differentiated liposarcoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and myeloproliferative neoplasia. This unusual tumour spectrum and the staggered occurrence of these tumours required multiple rounds of genetic testing and led to a delayed diagnosis of the BRCA2-associated tumour predisposition. In addition to the BRCA2 mutation, extended germline testing revealed an APC c.3920T > A variant and variants of unknown significance in the BRIP1 and ATR genes. The molecular analysis of the tumours revealed distinct profiles with differences in HRD status and in copy number variations, indicating no common origin. CONCLUSIONS: Our case study revealed that the pathogenic BRCA2 c.5946del germline variant can be associated with an unusual tumour spectrum, which may lead to a delayed diagnosis of a hereditary tumour predisposition. Thus, upfront genetic testing using large multigene panels or whole-genome sequencing in encouraged, especially in cases with a prominent family history."
39699292,Differential DNA Methylation in the Benign and Cancerous Prostate Tissue of African American and European American Men.,"BACKGROUND: African American (AA) men are at increased risk of prostate cancer compared with European American (EA) men. Biological mechanisms, including epigenetics, likely contribute to this disparity, but prior studies have been limited by sample size, candidate gene approaches, or lack of epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data. METHODS: To improve our understanding of these mechanisms, we compared DNAm features distinguishing tumor and paired histologically benign tissue from 76 AA and 75 EA patients with prostate cancer. We generated genome-wide array-based DNAm data and conducted differential methylation analyses comparing tumor and benign tissues in each ancestry group. We then examined the predictive ability of our identified sites and differential methylation by ancestry group. RESULTS: We identified 90,747 and 98,929 differentially methylated CpGs in AA and EA, respectively, with 76,400 common to both groups. We identified 6,267 genes with differentially methylated promoters common to both ancestries and 639 and 1,301 genes unique to AA and EA respectively, as well as differentially methylated pathways. Only 10 CpGs were needed to distinguish tumor from benign based on a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC > 0.9), with differentially methylated CpGs in one ancestry accurately predicting tumor versus benign in the other group. We also identified ancestry-associated CpGs (89 in tumor, 423 in benign). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation features distinguishing tumor and benign were similar for EA and AA men; however, subtle differences were identified. IMPACT: Differences in tumor and ancestry-associated CpGs may reveal differential tumor growth strategies, an important area for future disparities research."
39698999,Proteomics for Biomarker Discovery in Gynecological Cancers: A Systematic Review.,"The present study aims to summarize the current biomarker landscape in gynecological cancers (GCs) and incorporate bioinformatics analysis to highlight specific biological processes. The literature was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Library. The final search was conducted on December 7, 2022. Prospective registration was completed with the PROSPERO with registration number CRD42023477145. This systematic review covered proteomic research on biomarkers for cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. The PANTHER classification system was used to classify the shortlisted candidate biomarkers (CBs), and the STRING database was utilized to visualize protein-protein interaction networks. A total of 23 articles were included in this systematic review. Consistently regulated CBs in the GCs include collagen alpha-2(I) chain, collagen alpha-1(III) chain, collagen alpha-2(V) chain, calreticulin, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, beta polypeptide, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen gamma chain, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein C-IV, and apolipoprotein M. In conclusion, collagens, fibrinogens, chaperones, and apolipoproteins were revealed to be replicated in GCs and to be regulated consistently. These CBs contribute to GC etiology and physiology by participating in collagen fibril organization, blood coagulation, protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid transporter activity."
39698847,Radiotherapy-resistant prostate cancer cells escape immune checkpoint blockade through the senescence-related ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein.,"BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) exhibit intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) following radiotherapy (RT). This resistance is generally attributed to the limited antigen presentation of heterogeneous cells within tumors. Here, we aimed to isolate and characterize these diverse subgroups of tumor post-RT to understand the molecular mechanisms of their resistance to ICB. METHODS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to profile senescent cancer cell clusters induced by RT in LNCaP cells. The expression and phosphorylation levels of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in clinical samples from patients with or without RT. Co-immunoprecipitation, mutagenesis, and Western blotting were used to measure the interactions between proteins. Xenograft experiments were performed to assess the tumor immune response in the mice. RESULTS: We identified a subset of PCa cells that exhibited resistance to RT, characterized by a reduced antigen presentation capability, which enhanced their ability to evade immune detection and resist cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade. scRNA-seq revealed that the senescent state was a transient phase of PCa cells post-RT, particularly in CTLA-4 blockade treatment-resistant cells. This state was marked by increased cytosolic ATR level. Cytosolic ATR phosphorylated CD86 in its cytosolic domain and enhanced the interaction between CD86 and its E3 ligase MARCH1 through electrostatic attraction. Depletion or inhibition of Atr increased the sensitivity to immune attack and improved responses to anti-Ctla-4 antibody treatment in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the activation of cytosolic ATR, which is associated with cellular senescence, impedes the effectiveness of combined RT and ICB treatments. This discovery may provide valuable insights for improving the efficacy of combined RT and ICB therapies in PCa."
39698582,Identification of BIRC5 and HMMR as prognostic biomarkers for immune infiltration in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular mechanisms and identifying prognostic markers across various subtypes and stages of prostate cancer (PCa) are crucial for improving therapeutic strategies against the disease. This study focuses on discovering novel immune-related biomarkers that could aid in the evaluation and prognosis of PCa at different stages and serve as promising therapeutic targets. METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to PCa progression. The relationship between immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the expression levels of baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat containing 5 (BIRC5) and hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) were examined using xCELL and quanTIseq algorithms. RESULTS: The analysis identified ten key hub genes, with survival analysis indicating that higher expressions of BIRC5 and HMMR were associated with poor outcomes and may contribute to tumor progression. Notably, the expressions of BIRC5 and HMMR showed a significant correlation with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in various PCa subgroups. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluations further corroborated the bioinformatics findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms BIRC5 and HMMR as potential biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of PCa, providing important evidence for the development of future therapeutic strategies. Through further research, these biomarkers may be utilized in clinical practice to improve patient management and treatment outcomes."
39697756,Prognostic significance of B cell senescence-associated genes as risk markers in prostate adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is a common male urinary system cancer, and its targeted treatment is difficult. This study aimed to investigate the value of B cell senescence-related genes in PRAD prognosis. METHODS: PRAD sample expression and clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and B cell senescence-related gene sets were obtained from the Genecards library. The prognostic model was constructed by univariate, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analyses of PRAD differentially expressed genes significantly related to B cell senescence. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were drawn to verify the survival rate difference between the high and low risk score groups of the model. The differences of immune characteristics between high and low risk groups were evaluated by single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) score was used to assess the variation in genomic mutations across the groups. Small molecule drugs were screened through the GDSC library. Ultimately, in order to examine the risk assessment model's practicality, a nomogram was created. RESULTS: Three genes WNT16, INS and BMP2 related to PRAD progression and B cell senescence were selected to construct a prognostic risk assessment model. The K-M survival curve and ROC curve verified the good performance in evaluating the prognosis of patients. In terms of immune characteristics, the high-risk score group of the model showed a higher overall immune score and immune cell infiltration level, and the high-risk group showed a relatively higher TP53 and TTN mutation frequency. Drug sensitivity analysis showed that the high-risk group had higher resistance to Camptothecin, Cisplatin and WIKI4 drugs. At last, the nomogram that is created using pathological characteristics in conjunction with the risk score can reliably assess the prognosis of patients with PRAD. CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed and verified a B cell senescence-related gene model that can predict prognosis of PRAD. More importantly, it provides a reference standard for guiding the prognosis of PRAD patients."
39697708,Novel cuprotosis-related gene signature: a prognostic indicator and regulator of the glioma immune microenvironment.,"BACKGROUND: Glioma is a primary malignant brain tumor with a poor prognosis. Glioma-related biomarkers need to be identified to enable the personalized treatment of and predict the prognosis of glioma patients. Cuproptosis is an unusual mechanism of cell death, and is closely associated with disease progression and the immune-microenvironment of the tumor. However, the function of cuproptosis in glioma is still unclear, therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the role of cuproptosis-related genes in gliomas. METHODS: We examined the relationship between cuproptosis and glioma using the clinical and expression data of glioma tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). RESULTS: First, we determined the rate of somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) of 51 copper homeostasis-related genes and studied their correlation with prognosis. We then identified three molecular subgroups of copper homeostasis-related genes linked to prognosis. We discovered that different subgroups had distinct immune and biological features. We then developed a prognostic model by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression that comprised four cuproptosis-related genes; that is, a solute carrier family 31 member A1 (SLC31A1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), ATPase beta (ATP7B), and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3). This model was found to have strong prognostic ability in the CGGA cohort (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the function of copper homeostasis-related genes in neuroglioma and their relationship with tumor immunology. Our in-depth analyses revealed that these biomarkers are useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and could be used to guide our understanding of the progression of and treatment of glioma tumorigenesis."
39697480,Altered amino and fatty acids metabolism in Sudanese prostate cancer patients: insights from metabolic analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) management presents a multifaceted clinical challenge, intricately linking oncological considerations with cardiovascular health. Despite the recognized importance of lipid metabolism and hypertension in this interwoven relationship, their involvement in PCa development remains partially understood. This study aimed to explore variations in plasma metabolome among Sudanese PCa patients and their associated comorbidities. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 50 patients across four hospitals in Sudan and profiled by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. One-dimensional proton NMR spectra were acquired for each sample using standard nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy pulse sequence presat on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer. Metabolite concentrations were quantified using R scripts developed in-house. Univariate and multivariate analyses were generated in the R software. RESULTS: Patients were categorized into four distinct metabotypes based on their metabolic profiles, and statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the significance of observed differences. Our findings revealed high levels of fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol, valine, leucine, and isoleucine associated with non-hypertensive patients. In contrast, hypertensive patients were associated with high GlycA and GlycB levels and altered amino acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the intricate interplay between metabolic dysregulation and hypertension in PCa patients. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular pathways underlying lipid metabolism in PCa and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways. In conclusion, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the metabolic landscape of PCa in Sudanese patients, emphasizing the importance of personalized approaches in cancer management."
39696559,GG-NER's role in androgen receptor signaling inhibitor response for advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) often initially responds to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) but frequently develops resistance, driven by tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic pressure. Addressing the clinical challenge of identifying non-responsive patients and discovering new therapeutic targets is urgently needed. METHODS: We utilized single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) to elucidate the influence of the GG-NER pathway on ARSI response in PCa. We then constructed and validated a prognostic model based on this pathway using LASSO regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression, and ROC analysis. Additionally, we mapped tumor mutations to delineate the mutational landscapes across different risk groups and explored functional pathways through GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses. The impact of the GG-NER pathway on enzalutamide sensitivity and DNA repair in PCa was further validated through CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, in vivo experiments, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: ssGSEA indicated a trend of GG-NER pathway upregulation in patients with poor ARSI response. The GG-NER characteristic gene score (NECGS) identified a high-risk group with diminished ARSI response, serving as an independent prognostic indicator with strong predictive power. This high-risk group exhibited elevated TP53 mutation frequencies and significant enrichment in key pathways such as ribosome and mitochondrial functions, as well as MYC and E2F signaling. Experimental validation confirmed that targeting the GG-NER pathway or its key gene, ACTL6A, significantly reduces enzalutamide resistance in resistant cell lines and increases gammaH2AX expression. CONCLUSION: NECGS effectively predicts ARSI response in PCa, and our comprehensive analysis underscores the critical role of the GG-NER pathway in enzalutamide resistance, positioning ACTL6A as a potential therapeutic target for PCa."
39696535,HIPSD&R-seq enables scalable genomic copy number and transcriptome profiling.,"Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables decoding somatic cancer variation. Existing methods are hampered by low throughput or cannot be combined with transcriptome sequencing in the same cell. We propose HIPSD&R-seq (HIgh-throughPut Single-cell Dna and Rna-seq), a scalable yet simple and accessible assay to profile low-coverage DNA and RNA in thousands of cells in parallel. Our approach builds on a modification of the 10X Genomics platform for scATAC and multiome profiling. In applications to human cell models and primary tissue, we demonstrate the feasibility to detect rare clones and we combine the assay with combinatorial indexing to profile over 17,000 cells."
39695778,Exosome-delivered NR2F1-AS1 and NR2F1 drive phenotypic transition from dormancy to proliferation in treatment-resistant prostate cancer via stabilizing hormonal receptors.,"Cancer cells acquire the ability to reprogram their phenotype in response to targeted therapies, yet the transition from dormancy to proliferation in drug-resistant cancers remains poorly understood. In prostate cancer, we utilized high-plasticity mouse models and enzalutamide-resistant (ENZ-R) cellular models to elucidate NR2F1 as a key factor in lineage transition and ENZ resistance. Depletion of NR2F1 drives ENZ-R cells into a relative dormancy state, characterized by reduced proliferation and heightened drug resistance, while NR2F1 overexpression yields contrasting outcomes. Transcriptional sequencing analysis of NR2F1-silenced prostate cancer cells and tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas-prostate cancer and SU2C cohorts indicated exosomes as the most enriched cell component, with pathways implicated in steroid hormone biosynthesis and drug metabolism. Moreover, NR2F1-AS1 forms a complex with SRSF1 to upregulate NR2F1 expression, facilitating its binding with ESR1 to sustain hormonal receptor expression and enhance proliferation in ENZ-R cells. Furthermore, HnRNPA2B1 interacts with NR2F1 and NR2F1-AS1, assisting their packaging into exosomes, wherein exosomal NR2F1 and NR2F1-AS1 promote the proliferation of dormant ENZ-R cells. Our works offer novel insights into the reawaking of dormant drug-resistant cancer cells governed by NR2F1 upregulation triggered by exosome-derived NR2F1-AS1 and NR2F1, suggesting therapeutic potential for phenotype reversal."
39694406,Serological proteomic profiling uncovered CDK5RAP2 as a novel marker in benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects approximately half of men over the age of 50. Early detection and timely treatment facilitate disease intervention and achieve a better clinical outcome. However, current clinical methods, such as prostate specific antigen (PSA), lack the sensitivity to accurately distinguish between BPH and prostate cancer (PCa). Thus, optimal serum markers are warranted to complement existing diagnostic tests. METHODS: In this study, we recruited 1987 BPH patients and characterized their clinical features. To explore BPH proteomic alterations, a data independent acquisition-based mass spectrometry proteomics approach was adopted for 66 serum samples from healthy males (n = 22), patients with BPH (n = 22) and prostate cancer (n = 22). Bioinformatic evaluations were performed for proteomic profiling and candidate selection. In addition, a promising candidate was further validated with ELISA assay. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the level of free PSA correlated with prostate volume. 7.95 % of BPH patients had a PSA value greater than 10 ng/mL, with elevated free PSA, prostate volume, PSA density, and decreased free to total PSA ratio. Mass spectrometry-based serum profiling demonstrated distinct differences between BPH and PCa. CDK5RAP2 was weighted most important in BPH patients' serum and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.900 in distinguishing BPH and PCa, which was further validated by publicly-available mRNA microarray analysis and cellular phenotype evaluation. CONCLUSION: Our comprehensive analysis systematically explored BPH serum characteristics, proteomic profiles, and identified novel serum markers that may contribute to the understanding of BPH and facilitate early diagnosis and intervention."
39693918,"Comparative efficacy, safety, and oncological outcomes of percutaneous thermal and chemical ablation modalities for recurrent metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy from thyroid cancer.","BACKGROUND: Thermal and chemical ablation techniques may consolidate recurrent metastatic cervical lymph nodes as alternatives to repeat neck dissection in thyroid cancer patients. This meta-analysis aims to compare the efficacy and safety across modalities. METHODS: Four databases were searched for studies on radiofrequency (RFA), microwave (MWA), laser (LA), and ethanol ablation (EA) treating metastatic cervical nodes from thyroid cancer. The outcomes analyzed included treatment response, oncologic control, and complications. Random effects meta-analytical pooling was conducted. RESULTS: There were 25 studies (n = 1061 nodes) examining the four ablation methods. Patients showed comparable baseline characteristics and initial lymph node sizes ranging from 0.96 to 1.28 cm. All modalities achieved substantial node volume reduction (88.4 %) and disappearance (62.8 %), with significant biochemical decline (from 6.01 to 1.13 ng/ml, p = 0.18 between groups). MWA showed the highest volume reduction (99.4 %) and disappearance rate (87.6 %) versus slower efficacy of RFA (93.0 %, 72.1 %), LA (77.9 %, 62.5 %), and EA (81.8 %, 58.4 %). New malignancy/metastases risks ranged from 0.03 % to 1.3 % without between-group differences (p = 0.52). Major complications were absent; transient voice changes (0.05%-10.6 %) and neck pain (0.0%-5.9 %) were the main overall complaints. However, overall complication rates significantly varied by modality (1.1%-10.6 %; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Thermal and chemical ablation is effective in controlling the metastatic disease burden in patients with thyroid cancer, offering a potentially less morbid and non-surgical alternative to re-operation. Additional prospective data could confirm the long-term equivalent of revision neck dissection and stratify patients based on concomitant Hashimoto's and genomic mutations. Clarifying optimal patient selection and standardizing prognostic indexing could further enhance utilization."
39693612,Oral inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis exacerbate chronic graft-versus-host disease.,"The oral microbiota, second in abundance to the gut, is implicated in chronic systemic diseases, but its specific role in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) pathogenesis has been unclear. Our study finds that mucositis-induced oral dysbiosis in patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) associated with increased chronic GVHD (cGVHD), even in patients receiving posttransplant cyclophosphamide. In murine HCT models, oral dysbiosis caused by bilateral molar ligatures exacerbated cGVHD and increased bacterial load in the oral cavity and gut, with Enterococcaceae significantly increasing in both organs. In this model, the migration of Enterococcaceae to cervical lymph nodes both before and after transplantation activated antigen-presenting cells, thereby promoting the expansion of donor-derived inflammatory T cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that pathogenic bacteria increase in the oral cavity might not only exacerbate local inflammation but also enhance systemic inflammation throughout the HCT course. Additionally, these bacteria translocated to the gut and formed ectopic colonies, further amplifying systemic inflammation. Furthermore, interventions targeting the oral microbiome mitigated murine cGVHD. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of oral dysbiosis in cGVHD and suggest that modulation of the oral microbiome during transplantation may be an effective approach for preventing or treating cGVHD."
39692951,Analysis of transcriptomic data reveals the landscape of cholesterol metabolism in prostate cancer and impact of related signature on survival.,"BACKGROUND: Cholesterol metabolism is essential for the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Our previous study provided a new insight of cholesterol metabolism in the systematic management of PCa. However, the comprehensive role of cholesterol metabolism in PCa remains unclear. METHODS: Using the cholesterol metabolism related genes (CMRGs) downloaded from the MSigDB database, and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we constructed a cholesterol risk index by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model, and correlated the risk index with prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration and response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RT-qPCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, cell proliferation assays by CCK-8 and EdU assays, and cell apoptosis assays by flow cytometry analysis were also performed. RESULTS: We found PCa was tightly correlated with the cholesterol metabolism pathways. The cholesterol risk index was an excellent and independent predictor of prognosis for PCa. A nomogram involving the risk index and other clinical factors (age, T stage) was established to explore the clinical value of risk index. We found high-risk index group was associated with worse prognosis, higher TMB, lower infiltration level of CD8(+) T cells and a worse response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining validated the expression level of important CMRGs in PCa. In vitro experiments revealed downregulation of cholesterol metabolism could inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells and promoted their apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the comprehensive role of cholesterol metabolism in PCa. Using the risk index, we could predict the prognosis, TME infiltration and response to chemotherapy/immunotherapy of PCa. Better understanding and evaluating the cholesterol metabolism could aid in precision medicine and promoting prognosis of PCa."
39692937,Comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and multiple cancers.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and five cancers (breast, cervical, thyroid, prostate and colorectal) using the Mendelian Randomization (MR) method, with a view to revealing the potential role of LDL-C in the development of these cancers. METHODS: We used gene variant data and disease data from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) database to assess the causal relationship between LDL-C and each cancer by Mendelian randomisation analysis methods such as inverse variance weighting and MR-Egger. Specifically, we selected Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), genes associated with LDL-C levels, as instrumental variables, extracted the corresponding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and analysed the associations of these SNPs with five cancers.In addition, sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity tests were performed to ensure the reliability of the results. RESULTS: The analyses showed that when using HMGCR gene, LDL-C were significantly and positively associated with breast (OR:1.200, 95% CI:1.082-1.329, p = 0.001), prostate (OR:1.198, 95% CI:1.050-1.366, p = 0.007), and thyroid cancers (OR:8.291, 95% CI:3.189- 21.555, p = 0.00001) were significantly positively correlated, whereas they were significantly negatively correlated with colorectal cancer (OR:0.641, 95% CI:0.442-0.928, p = 0.019); the results for cervical cancer were not significant (p = 0.050). When using the PCSK9 gene, LDL-C levels were significantly and positively associated with breast (OR:1.107, 95%:CI 1.031-1.187, p = 0.005) and prostate (OR:1.219, 95%:CI 1.101-1.349, p = 0.0001) cancers, but not with cervical (p = 0.294), thyroid cancer (p = 0.759) and colorectal cancer ( p = 0.572). CONCLUSION: Analyses using both the HMGCR and PCSK9 genes have shown that LDL-C may be a potential risk factor for breast and prostate cancer, while analyses of the HMGCR gene have also suggested that LDL-C may increase the risk of thyroid cancer and decrease the risk of colorectal cancer."
39692780,Mendelian randomization analyses support causal relationships between HPV infection and colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections leading to a variety of diseases are a global public health issue.Despite the well-established link between HPV infection and cervical and anogenital cancers, there is ongoing debate regarding the relationship between HPV infection and colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: We evaluated the causal connection between HPV infection and CRC utilizing five Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets for HPV were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS project. A large summary of colorectal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer data from the FinnGen database was used as the outcome. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant association between genetically predicted HPV-16 infection and the risk of paternal colorectal adenocarcinoma (HPV-16: OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.013-1.102; p = 0.011), as well as CRC (HPV-16: OR 1.045, 95% CI 1.005-1.085; p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: These findings provide compelling evidence for a causal effect of HPV infection on the development of CRC. Further investigations into the underlying mechanisms and elucidation of this association are necessary to identify viable interventions for the prevention and treatment of HPV-associated CRC."
39690227,The 2024 generation.,
39690078,Defining the genetic profile of prostate cancer.,"Several studies indicated that prostate cancer has a hereditary component. In particular, a significant risk of prostate cancer has been linked to a tight familial lineage. However, to provide insight into how prostate cancer is inherited, characterising its genetic profile is essential. The current body of research on the analysis of genetic mutations in prostate cancer was reviewed to achieve this. This paper reports on the effects and underlying processes of prostate cancer that have been linked to decreased male fertility. Many research approaches used have resulted in the discovery of unique inheritance patterns and manifest traits, the onset and spread of prostate cancer have also been linked to many genes. Studies have specifically examined Androgen Receptor gene variants about prostate cancer risk and disease progression. Research has shown that genetic and environmental variables are important contributors to prostate cancer, even if the true origins of the disease are not fully recognised or established. Researchers studying the genetics of prostate cancer are using genome-wide association studies more and more because of their outstanding effectiveness in revealing susceptibility loci for prostate cancer. Genome-Wide Association Studies provides a detailed method for identifying the distinct sequence of a gene that is associated with cancer risk. Surgical procedures and radiation treatments are 2 of the treatment options for prostate cancer. Notwithstanding the compelling evidence shown in this work, suggests that more research must be done to detect the gene alterations and the use of genetic variants in the treatment of prostate cancer."
39689399,Exosomal signaling in gynecologic cancer development: The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts.,"Gynecologic cancer, a prevalent and debilitating disease affecting women worldwide, is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells in the reproductive organs. The complex etiology of gynecologic cancer encompasses multiple subtypes, including cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. Despite optimal treatment strategies, which typically involve cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, gynecologic cancer frequently exhibits recalcitrant relapse and poor prognosis. Recent studies have underscored the significance of the tumor microenvironment in ovarian carcinogenesis, particularly with regards to the discovery of aberrant genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles. Within this context, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerge as a crucial component of the stromal cell population, playing a pivotal role in oncogenesis and cancer progression. CAF-derived exosomes, small extracellular vesicles capable of conveying biological information between cells, have been implicated in a range of tumor-related processes, including tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, and immune responses. Furthermore, aberrant expression of CAF-derived exosomal noncoding RNAs and proteins has been found to strongly correlate with clinical and pathological characteristics of gynecologic cancer patients. Our review provides a novel perspective on the role of CAF-derived exosomes in gynecologic cancer, highlighting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
39687737,Fatty acid traits mediate the effects of uric acid on cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous findings on the association between uric acid (UA) levels and cancer risk are conflicting. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between UA levels, fatty acid traits, and cancer outcomes remain complex; it is still unclear whether elevated UA levels influence fatty acid traits and, thereby, contribute to an increased cancer risk. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between UA levels and cancer risk, with a specific focus on the potential mediating role of fatty acid traits. METHODS: We employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing genetic data from large-scale genome-wide association studies to assess the causal relationships among UA levels, fatty acid traits, and cancer risk. The primary method used was the inverse variance-weighted approach alongside Bayesian-weighted Mendelian randomization. Other MR models were also applied for comparison. Sensitivity analyses, based on various statistical assumptions, were also performed to evaluate the robustness of the findings. A two-step MR analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effects of fatty acid traits on the relationship between UA levels and cancer risk. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Elevated UA levels were associated with an increased risk of in situ neoplasms, cervical cancer, and invasive mucinous ovarian cancer, while they were linked to a decreased risk of cancers of the eye and adnexa, small cell lung cancer, bronchus and lung cancer, respiratory system and intrathoracic organ cancers, as well as lung cancer. Mediation analysis revealed that fatty acid traits, particularly the docosahexaenoic acid/trans fatty acid ratio, mediated the relationship between UA levels and lung cancer risk. These findings underscore the potential of fatty acid traits to mediate the association between UA levels and cancer risk, offering new insights for targeted interventions and potentially improving clinical outcomes."
39686539,Asymmetrical evolution of promoter methylation of mammalian genes after duplication.,"Even though gene duplication is a key source of new genes and evolutionary innovation, it is unclear how duplicates survive the period immediately following gene duplication, in which both copies are functionally redundant. In the absence of epigenetic silencing, the abundance of the gene product would double after gene duplication, which would often have deleterious effects. However, recent duplicates exhibit low expression levels, which could be at least partially explained by high levels of promoter methylation. What evolutionary paths lead to duplicate hypermethylation, and does it affect both duplicates, or only one? Here, we compare levels of promoter methylation in 10 human and 16 mouse tissues, between singletons and duplicates and among human-mouse orthologs of different kinds (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many). Our results indicate that: (1) on average, duplicates are more methylated than singletons in mouse, but less methylated than singletons in human, (2) recently duplicated genes tend to exhibit high levels of promoter methylation, (3) genes that undergo duplication tend to be highly methylated before duplication, (4) after gene duplication, one of the copies (the daughter copy, i.e. the one that relocates to a new genomic context) tends to undergo an additional increase in promoter methylation, whereas the other (the parental copy, which remains in the original genomic location) tends to retain pre-duplication methylation levels, and (5) daughter copies tend to be lowly expressed. These observations support a model in which daughter copies are repressed via promoter hypermethylation and can thus survive the filter of purifying selection until both copies diverge functionally."
39684702,The Natural History of Cervical Cancer and the Case for MicroRNAs: Is Human Papillomavirus Infection the Whole Story?,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression. MiRNAs regulate fundamental biological processes and have significant roles in several pathologies, including cancer. Cervical cancer is the best-known example of a widespread human malignancy with a demonstrated viral etiology. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) has been shown to be a causative factor for cervical carcinogenesis. Despite the occurrence of prophylactic vaccines, highly sensitive HPV diagnostics, and innovative new therapies, cervical cancer remains a main cause of death in developing countries. The relationship between hrHPV infection and cervical cancer depends on the integration of viral DNA to the host genome, disrupting the viral regulator E2 and the continuous production of the viral E6 and E7 proteins, which are necessary to acquire and maintain a transformed phenotype but insufficient for malignant cervical carcinogenesis. Lately, miRNAs, the tumor microenvironment, and immune evasion have been found to be major players in cervical carcinogenesis after hrHPV infection. Many miRNAs have been widely reported as deregulated in cervical cancer. Here, the relevance of miRNA in HPV-mediated transformation is critically reviewed in the context of the natural history of hrHPV infection and cervical cancer."
39684425,The Role of microRNA Expression and DNA Methylation in HPV-Related Cervical Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a major etiologic factor in cervical cancer, a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. The role of microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in cervical carcinogenesis is still largely unknown, but epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and miRNA regulation, are crucial factors. The integration of HPV DNA into the host genome can lead to alterations in DNA methylation patterns and miRNA expression, contributing to the progression from normal epithelium to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and, ultimately, to cervical cancer. This review aimed to examine the relationship between epigenetic changes in the development and progression of HPV associated with cervical cancer. A systematic literature search was conducted in major databases using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies that investigated the expression, function, and clinical significance of miRNAs, DNA methylation, and the expression of oncoproteins in HPV-related cervical cancer were included. Data extraction, quality assessment, and synthesis were performed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge. We provide an overview of the studies investigating miRNA expression in relation to cervical cancer progression, highlighting their common outcomes and their weaknesses/strengths. To achieve this, we systematically searched the Pubmed database for all articles published between January 2018 and December 2023. Our systematic review revealed a substantial body of evidence supporting the pivotal role of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of HPV-related cervical cancer and related oncoproteins. From the 28 studies retrieved, miR-124, FAM194/miR-124-2, and DNA methylation are the most frequently down- or up-regulated in CC progression. Notably, FAM194/miR-124-2 and DNA methylation emerged as a promising molecular marker for distinguishing between cases requiring immediate surgical intervention and those amenable to a more conservative wait-and-see approach. This systematic review underscores the critical involvement of microRNA in the context of HPV-related cervical cancer and sheds light on the potential clinical utility of FAM194/miR-124-2 and DNA methylation as a discriminatory tool for guiding treatment decisions. The identification of patients who may benefit from early surgical intervention versus those suitable for observation has important implications for personalized and targeted management strategies in the era of precision medicine."
39684309,Transcriptional Regulation of the Human MGP Promoter: Identification of Downstream Repressors.,"Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylated protein that was initially identified as a physiological inhibitor of ectopic calcification, primarily affecting cartilage and the vascular system. Mutations in the MGP gene were found to be responsible for the Keutel syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormal calcifications in the cartilage, lungs, brain, and vascular system. MGP has been shown to be dysregulated in several tumors, including cervical, ovarian, urogenital, and breast cancers. Using bioinformatic approaches, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) containing CpG dinucleotides were identified in the MGP promoter, including those for YY1, GATA1, and C/EBPalpha. We carried out functional tests using transient transfections with a luciferase reporter assay, primarily for the transcription factors YY1, GATA1, C/EBPalpha, and RUNX2. By co-transfection analysis, we found that YY1, GATA1, and C/EBPalpha repressed the MGP promoter. Furthermore, the co-transfection with RUNX2 activated the MGP promoter. In addition, MGP expression is negatively or positively correlated with the studied TFs' expression levels in several cancer types. This study provides novel insights into MGP regulation by demonstrating that YY1, GATA1, and C/EBPalpha are negative regulators of the MGP promoter, and DNA methylation may influence their activity. The dysregulation of these mechanisms in cancer should be further elucidated."
39682752,"Proteomic Analysis Reveals Cadherin, Actin, and Focal Adhesion Molecule-Mediated Formation of Cervical Cancer Spheroids.","Cancer spheroids are spherical, three-dimensional (3D), in vitro assemblies of cancer cells, which are gaining importance as a useful model in cancer behavior studies. Designed to simulate key features of the in vivo tumor microenvironment, spheroids offer reliable insights for drug screening and testing applications. We observed contrasting phenotypes in 3D cervical cancer (CC) cultures. Thus, in this study, we compared the proteomes of 3D and traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures of CC cell lines, HeLa, SiHa, and C33A. When cultured in in-house poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated plates under conditions suitable for 3D spheroid formation, these CC cell lines yielded spheroids exhibiting different features. Proteomic analysis of cells cultured in 2D and 3D cultures revealed similar protein profiles but remarkable differences in the expression levels of some proteins. In SiHa and C33A cells, the upregulation of key proteins required for spheroid formation was insufficient for the formation of compact spheroids. In contrast, HeLa cells could form compact spheroids because they upregulated the proteins, including cadherin-binding, cytoskeleton, and adhesion proteins, necessary for spheroid formation during the remodeling process. Overall, this study unravels the mechanisms underlying the formation of spheroids in the commonly used CC cell lines."
39682302,Prediagnostic Plasma Nutrimetabolomics and Prostate Cancer Risk: A Nested Case-Control Analysis Within the EPIC Study.,"Background and Objective: Nutrimetabolomics may reveal novel insights into early metabolic alterations and the role of dietary exposures on prostate cancer (PCa) risk. We aimed to prospectively investigate the associations between plasma metabolite concentrations and PCa risk, including clinically relevant tumor subtypes. Methods: We used a targeted and large-scale metabolomics approach to analyze plasma samples of 851 matched PCa case-control pairs from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Associations between metabolite concentrations and PCa risk were estimated by multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to control for multiple testing correction. Results: Thirty-one metabolites (predominately derivatives of food intake and microbial metabolism) were associated with overall PCa risk and its clinical subtypes (p < 0.05), but none of the associations exceeded the FDR threshold. The strongest positive and negative associations were for dimethylglycine (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.16-3.91) with advanced PCa risk (n = 157) and indole-3-lactic acid (OR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.09-0.87) with fatal PCa risk (n = 57), respectively; however, these associations did not survive correction for multiple testing. Conclusions: The results from the current nutrimetabolomics study suggest that apart from early metabolic deregulations, some biomarkers of food intake might be related to PCa risk, especially advanced and fatal PCa. Further independent and larger studies are needed to validate our results."
39681206,Probing the anticancer activities of facial trioxorhenium and tricarbonylrhenium compounds with heterocyclic ligands.,"The cytotoxicity of four rhenium compounds: fac-[ReO(3)(impy)CH(3)] (1) (impy = 2-(1H-imidazole-2-yl)pyridine), fac-[Re(CO)(3)(bzimpy)Cl] (2) (bzimpy = 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole), fac-[Re(CO)(3)(bibzimpy)Cl] (3) (bibzimpy = 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine) and fac-[Re(CO)(3)(impy)Cl] (4) was assessed against cancer cell lines, namely, the cervical hormone-responsive HeLa and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) HCC70 lines versus a non-tumorigenic control breast epithelial cell line, MCF12A. A rare facial trioxorhenium(VII) compound 1 was characterized via various physicochemical techniques. The rhenium compounds 1-4 were, in general, more cytotoxic to HeLa cells, compared to the TNBC HCC70 line, displaying half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in the micromolar range, however, the compounds were not convincingly selective for cancer cells over non-cancerous cells. In particular, compound 4 was highly cytotoxic towards HCC70, HeLa, and MCF12A cells, displaying low micromolar toxicity with IC(50) values of 6.57 +/- 1.11 muM, 8.88 +/- 1.07 and 9.41 +/- 1.04 muM in these three cell lines, respectively and was selected for further study as it displayed the greatest cytotoxicity against the highly treatment-resistant HCC70 TNBC cell line. Compound 4 was able to both bind to genomic DNA and act as an intercalator of CT-DNA, however, this did not lead to DNA damage as assessed by a comet assay. In addition, Compound 4 displayed a long-term dose-dependent effect on colony formation and long-term survival as a proxy of in vivo toxicity."
39681197,Roles of CDK12 mutations in PCa development and treatment.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers in men, and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) is emerging as a novel star player in the PCa tumorigenesis and progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In PCa, CDK12 alterations are mostly loss-of-function mutations featuring intronic polyadenylation (IPA), focal tandem duplications (FTDs), and R-loops formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs). The occurrence of IPA can result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and androgen receptor (AR) variation. FTDs induce neoantigens and increase the expression of the AR, MYC, and other hotspot- associated genes. R-loops lead to TRCs and influence various cellular processes, including gene expression and genome stability. Due to the poor prognosis of CDK12-mutant PCa patients and the mediocre response to classic standard therapies, HRD and increased neoantigen levels have provided clinicians with new insights into alternative systematic treatments for this novel PCa phenotype. In this review, we summarize the roles of CDK12 mutations in PCa and discuss their clinical value, suggesting that CDK12 potentially represents a target for further research and the development of clinical strategies for PCa."
39678610,Contemplating the prognostic and therapeutic potential of CD19: a comprehensive analysis across diverse cancer types.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer represents a highly intricate disease, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation and invasion of aberrant cells, leading to widespread global morbidity and mortality. This study investigates the influence of CD19, a marker specific to B-cells, within the tumor microenvironment (TME) across a spectrum of cancer types. METHODOLOGY: To explore the role of CD19, we employed a wide array of bioinformatics tools and databases, including UALCAN, GEPIA2, univariate Cox regression, KM plotter, HPA, GSCA, cBioPortal, TISIDB, and DAVID. Additionally, we conducted experimental validations using cell culture, Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and western blot analyses. RESULTS: An extensive analysis of CD19 expression was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourced from TIMER2 and UALCAN, covering 33 different cancer types. We observed a marked variability in CD19 expression, with notable upregulation in Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) and Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), contrasted by significant downregulation in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CESC), Rectum Adenocarcinoma (READ), and Sarcoma (SARC). Prognostic assessments through univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier plots revealed that lower levels of CD19 were linked to a poorer overall survival rate in CESC, READ, and SARC. These findings were reinforced by validation using GEPIA2 and GSCA, where reduced CD19 expression correlated negatively with methylation levels in the affected cancers. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) provided additional confirmation of these results. Mutation analysis through cBioPortal suggested that alterations in CD19 were infrequent and had a minimal impact on tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). Correlation studies using TISIDB highlighted significant associations between CD19 expression and immune-related genes, emphasizing its potential role in immune regulation. Additionally, GSCA analysis demonstrated that CD19 expression was positively associated with immune cell infiltration, though no significant effect on drug sensitivity was detected. Experimental validation using RT-qPCR in READ cell lines substantiated the down-regulation of CD19. Further functional analysis revealed that reduced CD19 expression significantly influenced the cellular behavior of SW480 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the critical role of CD19 within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and a therapeutic target in specific types of cancer."
39678351,Non-coding genetic variants underlying higher prostate cancer risk in men of African ancestry.,"Incidence and severity of prostate cancer (PrCa) substantially varies across ancestries. American men of African ancestry (AA) are more likely to be diagnosed with and die from PrCa than the those of European ancestry (EA). Published polygenic risk scores for developing prostate cancer, even those based on multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies, do not address population-specific genetic mechanisms underlying PrCa risk in men of African ancestry. Specifically, the role of non-coding regulatory polymorphisms in driving inter-ancestry variation in PrCa has not been suficiently explored. Here, by employing a sequence-based deep learning model of prostate regulatory enhancers, we identified ~ 2,000 SNPs with higher alternate allele frequency in AA men that potentially affect enhancer function associated with PrCa susceptibility, as supported by our experimental validation. The identified enhancer SNPs (eSNPs) may influence PrCa development through two complementary mechanisms: 1) the alternate allele that increase enhancer activity result in immune suppression and telomere elongation, and 2) the alternate alleles that decrease enhancer activity, lead to de-differentiation and inhibition of apoptosis. Notably, the eSNPs tend to disrupt the binding of known prostate transcription factors including FOX, AR and HOX families. Lastly, the identified eSNPs can be combined into a polygenic risk score that adds value to current GWAS-based risk variants in assessing PrCa risk in independent cohorts."
39675559,Validation and Performance of Quantitative BRCA1 and RAD51C Promoter Hypermethylation Testing in Breast and Ovarian Cancers.,"Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a significant advancement in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and they are poised to improve treatment in an increasing number of other cancer types. PARP inhibitor efficacy as monotherapy has been primarily observed in tumors with deleterious genetic variants in genes involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway. Tumors without these variants have also been shown to respond; notably, those with hypermethylation at all alleles of the BRCA1 or RAD51C promoter can respond to PARP inhibitors. These epigenetic biomarkers therefore represent a patient population that may also benefit from this targeted therapy. However, no robust test has been conducted to identify these biomarkers in routine clinical specimens that is amenable to implementation for decentralized testing. This study describes the analytical and clinical validation of a BRCA1 and RAD51C promoter methylation test that can be run with a single-day library preparation workflow for sequencing on any next-generation sequencing platform. The results show that this test can accurately quantitate the level of promoter methylation at the BRCA1 and RAD51C genes using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, even when the extracted DNA is extremely degraded or the input amount is limited. This test increases the precision of diagnostic tests aimed at identifying patients who are likely and unlikely to respond to PARP inhibitor therapy."
39673000,Genome-integrated Human Papilloma Viruses Testing: A Complement to Colposcopy-guided Biopsy for Cervical Cancer Screening.,"OBJECTIVE: Our research aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of colposcopy-guided biopsy (CGB) in detecting high-grade cervical lesions and explore how human papilloma virus (HPV) integration status and other factors affect its performance. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis involving 550 patients was conducted to evaluate whether the HPV integration plays a role in identifying high-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancer. Logistic regression models and area under the curve (AUC) calculations were employed. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that 53.5% of CGB/surgery pairs demonstrated congruent diagnoses, whereas 17.1% showed underestimation and 29.5% overestimation. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified several key predictors for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2+ and CIN3+ according to surgical pathology. Notably, a CGB confirming CIN2+ [odds ratio (OR)=6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.9-9.1, P<0.001], high-grade cytology (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.4-1.9, P=0.003), and HPV integration positivity (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.5, P<0.001) emerged as significant factors for CIN2+. Similarly, for CIN3+ identification, CGB confirming CIN2+ (OR=5.3, 95% CI: 3.4-8.3, P<0.001), high-grade cytology (OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.5-4.7, P=0.001), and HPV integration positivity (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.3-3.1, P=0.003) were independent predictors. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the innovative role of HPV integration testing as a pivotal adjunct to CGB and cytology, offering a comprehensive approach that may enhance the diagnostic precision for high-grade cervical lesions, ultimately achieving more precise management strategies."
39672812,Canonical androgen response element motifs are tumor suppressive regulatory elements in the prostate.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is central in prostate tissue identity and differentiation, and controls normal growth-suppressive, prostate-specific gene expression. It also drives prostate tumorigenesis when hijacked for oncogenic transcription. The execution of growth-suppressive AR transcriptional programs in prostate cancer (PCa) and the potential for reactivation remain unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs-the classic DNA binding elements for AR-to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR(+) PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients. Canonical AREs maintain a normal, lineage-specific transcriptional program that can be reengaged in PCa cells, offering therapeutic potential and clinical relevance."
39672307,Analysis of the progression of cervical cancer in a low-and-middle-income country: From pre-malignancy to invasive disease.,"To better understand cervical cancer progression, we analyzed RNA from 262 biopsies from women referred for colposcopy. We determined the HPV type and analyzed the expression of 51 genes. HPV31 was significantly more prevalent in precancer than stage 1 cancer and invasive cancer (p < 0.0001), and HPV16 increased in invasive disease (p < 0.0001). CCNE1, MELTF, and ULBP2 were significantly increased in HPV16-positive compared to HPV31 precancers, while NECTIN2 and HLA-E expression decreased. Markers of the innate immune system, DNA repair genes, and cell cycle genes are significantly increased during cancer progression (p = 0.0001). In contrast, the TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor gene expression is significantly decreased in cancer cells. The T cell markers CD28 and FLT3LG expression decreased in cancer while FOXP3, IDO1, and ULBP2 expression increased. There is a significantly higher survival rate in individuals with increased expression of CD28 (p = 0.0005), FOXP3 (p = 0.0002), IDO1 (p = 0.038), FLT3LG (p = 0.026), APOBEC3B (p = 0.0011), and RUNX3 (p = 0.019), and a significantly lower survival rate in individuals with increased expression of ULBP2 (p = 0.035). These results will help us elucidate the molecular factors influencing the progression of cervical precancer to cancer. Understanding the risk of progression of specific HPV types and sublineages may aid in the triage of positive patients, and better knowledge of the immune response may aid in developing and applying immunotherapies."
39671538,"High Omega-3, Low Omega-6 Diet With Fish Oil for Men With Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance: The CAPFISH-3 Randomized Clinical Trial.","PURPOSE: Men on active surveillance (AS) for prostate cancer are extremely interested in dietary changes or supplements to prevent progression of their disease. We sought to determine whether a high omega-3, low omega-6 fatty acid diet with fish oil capsules (D + FO) decreases proliferation (Ki-67) in prostate biopsies in men with prostate cancer on AS over a 1-year time period. METHODS: In this phase II, prospective randomized trial, men (N = 100) with grade group 1 or 2 prostate cancer who elected AS were randomly assigned to the D + FO or a control group. Same-site prostate biopsies were obtained at baseline and 1 year. The primary end point was the change in Ki-67 index from baseline to 1 year from same-site biopsies compared between the groups. RESULTS: The Ki-67 index decreased in the D + FO group by approximately 15% from baseline to 1 year (1.34% at baseline, 1.14% at 1 year) and increased in the control group by approximately 24% from baseline to 1 year (1.23% at baseline, 1.52% at 1 year), resulting in a statistically significant difference in the change of Ki-67 index between the groups (95% CI, 2% to 52%, P = .043). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes grade group, tumor length, Decipher genomic score, or prostate-specific antigen between the two groups. Four patients in the D + FO group were withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events related to the FO. CONCLUSION: A high omega-3, low omega-6 diet with FO for 1 year resulted in a significant reduction in Ki-67 index, a biomarker for prostate cancer progression, metastasis, and death. These findings support future phase III trials incorporating this intervention in men on AS."
39668816,"DHX34 as a promising biomarker for prognosis, immunotherapy and chemotherapy in Pan-Cancer: A Comprehensive Analysis and Experimental Validation.","Background: As a member of the DExD/H-box RNA helicase family, DHX34 has demonstrated a significant correlation with the development of multiple disorders. Nevertheless, a comprehensive investigation between DHX34 and pan-cancer remains unexplored. Methods: We analyzed the value of DHX34 in pan-cancer based on some databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) by use the R language as well as some online analysis tools, including STRING, TISIDB, TISCH2. And based on our samples we performed Western blot (WB), qPCR and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) experiments. Results: DHX34 was highly expressed in most tumors, including Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC), compared to corresponding normal tissues. Among cervical cancers, DHX34 mutation frequency was the highest. Intriguingly, a positive correlation was observed between DHX34 expression and Mutational Burden (TMB) across 12 tumor types, and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) across 10 tumor types. Remarkably, DHX34 exhibited a favorable diagnostic value in a multitude of tumors. High expression of DHX34 is associated with poor prognosis in tumors such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), low-grade glioma (LGG), and LIHC. Correlation analysis indicated that DHX34 expression correlated with clinicopathological features in a variety of tumors. The Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network and GSCALite database suggested that DHX34 and its ten co-expression genes might promote cancer progression by regulating the cell cycle. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results further showed that DHX34 was positively correlated with pathways such as cell cycle, mitosis, and gene transcription regulation. The TISIDB database showed that DHX34 expression was closely associated with immune infiltration. Based on the TISCH2 database, we found that DHX34 was expressed in a number of immune cells, with relatively high expression in monocyte macrophages in LIHC. Conclusions: In summary, our study found that DHX34 is highly expressed in pan-cancer and has diagnostic and prognostic value. Targeting DHX34 may improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in a multitude of tumors."
39668304,Optimizing autophagy modulation for enhanced TRAIL-mediated therapy: Unveiling the superiority of late-stage inhibition over early-stage inhibition to overcome therapy resistance in cancer.,"Autophagy is a vital mechanism that eliminates large cytoplasmic components via lysosomal degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis. The role of autophagy in cancer treatment has been studied extensively. Autophagy primarily prevents tumour initiation by maintaining genomic stability and preventing cellular inflammation. However, autophagy also supports cancer cell survival and growth by providing essential nutrients for therapeutic resistance. Thus, autophagy has emerged as a promising strategy for overcoming resistance and enhancing anti-cancer therapy. Inhibiting autophagy significantly improves the sensitivity of lung, colorectal, breast, liver and prostate cancer cells to tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). This review investigates the intricate interplay between autophagy modulation and TRAIL-based therapy, specifically focussing on comparing the efficacy of late-stage autophagy inhibition versus early-stage inhibition in overcoming cancer resistance. We expose the distinctive advantages of late-stage autophagy inhibition by exploring the mechanisms underlying autophagy's impact on TRAIL sensitivity. Current preclinical and clinical investigations are inspected, showing the potential of targeting late-stage autophagy for sensitizing resistant cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This review emphasizes the significance of optimizing autophagy modulation to enhance TRAIL-mediated therapy and overcome the challenge of treatment resistance in cancer. We offer insights and recommendations for guiding the development of potential therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the challenges posed by treatment-resistant cancers."
39665894,Assessing the Molecular Heterogeneity of Prostate Cancer Biopsy Sampling: Insights from the MAST Trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PC) heterogeneity can result in sampling discrepancies during biopsy, leading to inaccurate molecular classifications that affect treatment decisions. We evaluated transcriptomic profile variability between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-targeted biopsy (TBx) and systematic biopsy (SBx) methods using the Decipher GRID platform. METHODS: The study included 205 men from the MAST trial. We analyzed 408 biopsy samples, of which 149 were TBx and 259 were SBx samples. Three prognostic signatures-the Decipher genomic classifier (DGC), cell cycle progression (CCP), and Genomic Prostate Score-were assessed in relation to grade group (GG) and MRI phenotype. Multivariable linear regression was conducted to adjust for the confounding effects of GG and tumor purity. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Unpaired analysis revealed that TBx samples had higher derived GPS and CCP scores than SBx samples (p < 0.05), but the difference was no longer significant after multiple-test adjustment. There was no significant difference in scores between SBx and TBx samples in the subgroup with GG 1 disease. For TBx cores, higher genomic scores were associated with higher Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores in the overall cohort, but not in the GG 1 subgroup. Multivariable analysis revealed significant associations between DGC and CCP scores and PI-RADS scores (p < 0.01). Higher DGC score concordance between TBx and SBx lesions was observed in the low-risk subgroup. A limitation of the study is the small sample size, so further validation is required. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: TBx samples yield higher genomic scores than SBx samples, with grade influencing the association between PI-RADS score and genomic risk. For the GG 1 subgroup, there was no correlation between PI-RADS and genomic scores. These findings need further validation to assess the impact of TBx on genomic risk assessment in active surveillance. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the effectiveness of two different biopsy methods in assessing the risk of prostate cancer (PC) progression. We found that while biopsy samples guided by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans often showed higher genetic risk scores than biopsy samples without MRI guidance, the difference was not significant for men with lower-grade PC. Our findings suggest that MRI targeting for biopsy might not always provide additional information about cancer aggressiveness for patients with low-risk PC."
39665434,Phosphoproteomics guides low dose drug combination of cisplatin and silmitasertib against concurrent chemoradiation resistant cervical cancer.,"Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for cervical patients with locally advanced disease. Despite the improved survival rates and prognosis observed in patients undergoing CCRT, over 30-40% do not achieve complete response and are at risk of locoregional recurrence. Targeting crucial molecules that confer resistance may improve the clinical outcomes of the treatment resistant patient cohort. Herein, we employed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based phosphoproteomic approach to identify the altered phosphophorylation events, activated kinases and dysregulated pathways involved in treatment resistance. We quantified 2531 unique phosphopeptides mapping to 1099 proteins of which 74 proteins were differentially phosphorylated between the cohorts. Pathway analysis revealed dysregulation of the DNA repair pathway and the proteins involved in DNA repair in the non-responder cohort. Additionally, we identified kinase signature associated with CCRT resistance. Kinases such as CSNK2A1, PRKDC, PLK-1, NEK2, ATM and CDK1 are predicted to be activated in non-responders. In particular, we showed that CSNK2A1 is involved in oncogenesis of cervical cancer and pharmacological inhibition led to reduced cell proliferation, migration and colony formation. Moreover, the combination of the CSNK2A1 inhibitor, silmitasertib with cisplatin demonstrated synergism (combination index < 1) and yielded a beneficial reduction in dosage. The dose reduced combination potentially reduced the proliferative, migratory and colony formation ability in vitro. Our findings highlight the potential of phosphoproteomics to identify clinically significant targets and pathways implicated in CCRT resistance. Our study also indicates that combination therapy could serve as an effective treatment strategy to improve the efficacy of patients undergoing CCRT."
39665170,Histopathologic Features and Transcriptomic Signatures Do Not Solve the Issue of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Invisible Prostate Cancers: A Matched-Pair Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is pivotal in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, but some clinically significant (cs) PCa remain undetected. This study aims to understand the pathological and molecular basis for csPCa visibility at mpMRI. METHODS: We performed a retrospective matched-pair cohort study, including patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for csPCa (i.e., ISUP grade group >/= 2) from 2015 to 2020, in our tertiary-referral center. We screened for inclusion in the ""mpMRI-invisible"" cohort all consecutive men (N = 45) having a negative preoperative mpMRI. The ""mpMRI-visible"" cohort was matched based on age, PSA, prostate volume, ISUP grade group. Included patients underwent radiological and pathological open-label revisions and characterization of the tumor mRNA expression profile (analyzing 780 gene transcripts, signaling pathways, and cell-type profiling). We compared the clinical-pathological variables and the gene expression profile between matched pairs. The analysis was stratified according to histological characteristics and lesion diameter. RESULTS: We included 34 patients (17 per cohort); mean age at RP and PSA were 70.5 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.7), 7.1 ng/mL (SD = 3.3), respectively; 65% of men were ISUP 2. Overall, no significant differences in histopathological features, tumor diameter and location, mRNA profile, pathways, and cell-type scores emerged between cohorts. In the stratified analysis, an upregulation of cell adhesion and motility, of extracellular matrix remodeling and of metastatic process pathways was present in specific subgroups of mpMRI-invisible cancers. CONCLUSIONS: No PCa pathological or gene-expression hallmarks explaining mp-MRI invisibility were identified. Aggressive features can be present both in mpMRI-invisible and -visible tumors."
39664731,Exploring the therapeutic potency of cryptotanshinone in cervical cancer: a multi-omics and network pharmacology approach.,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer remains a significant challenge in oncology with an escalating demand for novel therapeutic strategies that can navigate the complexities of its pathophysiology. This study elucidated the antineoplastic effects of cryptotanshinone, a derivative of danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), a herb widely utilized in traditional Chinese medicine practices. METHODS: Employing a comprehensive multi-omics approach, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and bioinformatics analyses, we investigated the potential effects of cryptotanshinone on cervical cancer through data mining and computational analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrated that the potential of cryptotanshinone to disrupted cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis may be ascribed to its modulation of gene expression and interaction with specific protein networks. Furthermore, network pharmacology and pathway enrichment analyses identified critical hubs and signaling pathways, suggesting a multi-targeted mechanism of action. Furthermore, the establishment of a prognostic model, which is founded upon differentially expressed genes linked to cryptotanshinone treatment, underscores its promising role as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic agent. These insights pave the way for the integration of cryptotanshinone into therapeutic regimens, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the efficacy of cervical cancer treatment and patient outcomes."
39664380,B7-H3 in glioblastoma and beyond: significance and therapeutic strategies.,"Cancer has emerged as the second most prevalent disease and the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 10 million individuals each year. The predominant varieties of cancer encompass breast, lung, colon, rectal, and prostate cancers. Among the more aggressive malignancies is glioblastoma, categorized as WHO stage 4 brain cancer. Following diagnosis, the typical life expectancy ranges from 12 to 15 months, as current established treatments like surgical intervention, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy using temozolomide exhibit limited effectiveness. Beyond conventional approaches, the exploration of immunotherapy for glioblastoma treatment is underway. A methodology involves CAR-T cells, monoclonal antibodies, ADCC and nanobodies sourced from camelids. Immunotherapy's recent focal point is the cellular ligand B7-H3, notably abundant in tumor cells while either scarce or absent in normal ones. Its expression elevates with cancer progression and serves as a promising prognostic marker. In this article, we delve into the essence of B7-H3, elucidating its function and involvement in signaling pathways. We delineate the receptors it binds to and its significance in glioblastoma and other cancer types. Lastly, we examine its role in immunotherapy and the utilization of nanobodies in this domain."
39661598,A novel family of beta mixture models for the differential analysis of DNA methylation data: An application to prostate cancer.,"Identifying differentially methylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites between benign and tumour samples can assist in understanding disease. However, differential analysis of bounded DNA methylation data often requires data transformation, reducing biological interpretability. To address this, a family of beta mixture models (BMMs) is proposed that (i) objectively infers methylation state thresholds and (ii) identifies differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) given untransformed, beta-valued methylation data. The BMMs achieve this through model-based clustering of CpG sites and by employing parameter constraints, facilitating application to different study settings. Inference proceeds via an expectation-maximisation algorithm, with an approximate maximization step providing tractability and computational feasibility. Performance of the BMMs is assessed through thorough simulation studies, and the BMMs are used for differential analyses of DNA methylation data from a prostate cancer study. Intuitive and biologically interpretable methylation state thresholds are inferred and DMCs are identified, including those related to genes such as GSTP1, RASSF1 and RARB, known for their role in prostate cancer development. Gene ontology analysis of the DMCs revealed significant enrichment in cancer-related pathways, demonstrating the utility of BMMs to reveal biologically relevant insights. An R package betaclust facilitates widespread use of BMMs."
39661509,Profiling low-mRNA content cells in complex human tissues using BD Rhapsody single-cell analysis.,"The successful recovery of immune cells, particularly those with low mRNA content, by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains a significant challenge. Tissue dissociation and selection of the appropriate scRNA-seq technology are crucial. Our protocol efficiently recovers low-mRNA content immune cells using the BD Rhapsody scRNA-seq platform. It includes optimized tissue dissociation for prostate, lung, and liver tissues, cell labeling with Sample Tag antibodies, microwell-based single-cell capture, cDNA synthesis, library preparation, and data pre-processing with basic quality control analysis.

39660220,LBFextract: Unveiling transcription factor dynamics from liquid biopsy data.,"MOTIVATION: The analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) holds immense promise as a non-invasive diagnostic tool across various human conditions. However, extracting biological insights from cfDNA fragments entails navigating complex and diverse bioinformatics methods, encompassing not only DNA sequence variation, but also epigenetic characteristics like nucleosome footprints, fragment length, and methylation patterns. RESULTS: We introduce Liquid Biopsy Feature extract (LBFextract), a comprehensive package designed to streamline feature extraction from cfDNA sequencing data, with the aim of enhancing the reproducibility and comparability of liquid biopsy studies. LBFextract facilitates the integration of preprocessing and postprocessing steps through alignment fragment tags and a hook mechanism. It incorporates various methods, including coverage-based and fragment length-based approaches, alongside two novel feature extraction methods: an entropy-based method to infer TF activity from fragmentomics data and a technique to amplify signals from nucleosome dyads. Additionally, it implements a method to extract condition-specific differentially active TFs based on these features for biomarker discovery. We demonstrate the use of LBFextract for the subtype classification of advanced prostate cancer patients using coverage signals at transcription factor binding sites from cfDNA. We show that LBFextract can generate robust and interpretable features that can discriminate between different clinical groups. LBFextract is a versatile and user-friendly package that can facilitate the analysis and interpretation of liquid biopsy data. DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: LBFextract is freely accessible at https://github.com/Isy89/LBF. It is implemented in Python and compatible with Linux and Mac operating systems. Code and data to reproduce these analyses have been uploaded to 10.5281/zenodo.10964406."
39659944,Effect of subcutaneous adipose tissue-associated CSRP2 on the progression of prostate cancer via the WDR5/USP44 pathway.,"Elevated subcutaneous adipose tissue in obese men correlates strongly with a higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer and poor treatment outcomes, but the exact mechanism underlying the increased risk remains elusive. To address this question, we analyzed prostate cancer transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas as well as single-cell RNA sequencing and tissue microarray data from prostate cancer cells. Subcutaneous adipose tissue-associated cysteine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer epithelial cells. Knockdown of CSRP2 promoted proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3, whereas the opposite effect was observed with CSRP2 overexpression. In vivo xenograft assays confirmed that CSRP2 overexpression inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry assays confirmed that CSRP2 inhibits the deubiquitination of WD40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5) by ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44). Overexpression of WDR5 reversed the growth inhibition of CSRP2 overexpression on prostate cancer cells. Altogether, our data indicate that CSRP2 suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation via a CSRP2/WDR5/USP44 dependent pathway to control prostate cancer progression, suggesting a potential mechanism for prostate cancer treatment."
39657349,Integrin alpha1 upregulation by TF:FVIIa complex promotes cervical cancer migration through PAR2-dependent MEK1/2 activation.,"Tissue factor (TF) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) have been associated with the progression of cancer, while integrins are essential for the adhesion and migration of cancer cells. This study aimed to explore the cross-talk between the TF:FVIIa complex, PAR2 signaling, and the expression of integrin alpha1 in cervical cancer cells. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the research examined the relationship between the TF and PAR2 genes and the integrin alpha1 gene (ITGA1) in reproductive cancers, revealing a positive correlation between integrin alpha1 expression and both TF and PAR2 genes. Analyses through Western blotting and RT-PCR demonstrated that TF:FVIIa complex transactivates PAR2, which significantly increases the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and subsequently elevates integrin alpha1 expression. Inhibition of either PAR2 or MEK1/2 resulted in a decrease in the FVIIa-induced increase in integrin alpha1 expression. Additionally, cell migration studies indicated that elevated expression of integrin alpha1, mediated by the TF:FVIIa/PAR2 pathway, was linked to enhanced cell migration, which could be inhibited by blocking integrin alpha1. This investigation uncovers a novel signaling pathway in HeLa cells, highlighting the significance of the TF:FVIIa:PAR2 axis in modulating integrins that are vital for cancer progression, thereby offering insights for potential targeted therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment."
39656422,Role of BRCA1 in glioblastoma etiology.,"BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene with a role in DNA repair by Homologous Recombination (HR), and maintenance of genomic stability that is frequently investigated in breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. BRCA1 mutations or dysregulation in glioblastoma can lead to impaired DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in tumor progression and resistance to standard therapies. Several studies have shown that BRCA1 expression is altered, albeit rarely, in glioblastoma, leading to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In addition, the communication of BRCA1 with other molecular pathways such as p53 and PTEN further complicates its role in glioblastoma pathogenesis. Targeting BRCA1-related pathways in these cases has shown the potential to improve the efficacy of standard treatments, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The development of (Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase) PARP inhibitors that exploit the lack of HR also offers a therapeutic approach to glioblastoma patients with BRCA1 mutations. Despite these advances, the heterogeneity of glioblastoma and its complex tumor microenvironment make the translation of such approaches into clinical practice still challenging, and there is an ""unmet need"". This review discusses the current mechanisms of etiology and potential treatment of BRCA1-related glioblastoma."
39655393,Genomic Effects of Biomechanical Loading in Adolescent Human Growth Plate Cartilage: A Pilot Study.,"OBJECTIVE: The genomic effects of biomechanical loading on human growth plate cartilage are unknown so far. To address this, we used rare human growth plate biopsies obtained from children undergoing epiphysiodesis and exposed them to precisely controlled mechanical loading using a microloading device. The biopsies were cultured 24 hours after mechanical loading, followed by RNA-sequencing analyses to decipher the genomic regulation. DESIGN: We conducted RNA-seq analysis of human growth plate cartilage obtained from three patients cultured ex vivo and subjected to cyclical mechanical loading with peak 0.4 N with frequency 0.77 Hz during a 30-second duration, using a specialized microloading device. RESULTS: Gene ontology analysis revealed novel data showing three significantly upregulated signaling pathways, including notch, oxytocin, and tight junction, and three significantly downregulated signaling pathways, including lysosome, sphingolipid metabolism, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) in human growth plate cartilage. Moreover, we found 15 significantly regulated genes within these signaling pathways from all three patients. These genes included PSEN2, HEY1, and NCOR2 from the notch signaling; CACNB1 and PPP3R2 from the oxytocin signaling; ACTR3C, WHAMM, and ARHGEF18 from the tight junction signaling; ARSA, SMPD1, and CD68 from the lysosome signaling; ARSA and SMPD1 from the sphingolipid metabolism signaling; and SLC27A4 and AQP7 from the PPAR signaling pathway. In addition, 20 significantly upregulated genes and six significantly downregulated genes shared between two patient samples were identified. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first-ever transcriptomic data of mechanical loading of human growth plate cartilage. These findings can potentially provide genetic targets for future investigations in physiological and pathological bone growth conditions."
39655325,Evidence of prostate cancer-linked virus zoonoses from biophysical genomic variations.,"An ongoing double-blind examination of (mathematically) smooth functional dependences of population-based genomic distributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on quantified environmental parameters has flagged a SNP that has been associated with prostate cancer for dependence on zoonotic viruses. The SNP rs13091518 is an intergenic variant near the gene/pseudo-gene COX6CP6 on chromosome 3. The risk T allele, which is the major allele in all homeostatic populations considered, clearly demonstrates a negative adaptive force of about -0.1 universal genomic energy units/zoonotic virus unit. This biophysical perspective has thus provided evidence for a causative relationship between zoonotic viruses and prostate cancer. Our findings are consistent with other studies that have found an association between several zoonotic viruses and prostate cancer. This result demonstrates the significance of an intergenic variant in the adaptive response to a viral zoonotic pathogen."
39653828,High interobserver variability of PTEN immunohistochemistry defining PTEN status in low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer: results of the first German ring trial.,"The prognostication of individual disease trajectory and selection of optimal therapy in patients with localized, low-grade prostate cancer often presents significant difficulty. The phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) has emerged as a potential novel biomarker in this clinical context, based on its demonstrated prognostic significance in multiple retrospective studies. Incorporation into standard clinical practice necessitates exceptional diagnostic accuracy, and PTEN's binary readout-retention or loss-suggests its suitability as a biomarker. This multi-institutional ring trial aimed to validate the diagnostic precision of PTEN immunohistochemistry in localized, low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, across ten university pathology institutes in Germany. The trial incorporated 90 cases of patients diagnosed with acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate of grade groups 1 (n = 8, 8.9%) and 2 (n = 82, 91.1%) post-radical prostatectomy. Remarkably, the interpretation of PTEN immunohistochemistry displayed substantial variation (12.5-51.2% PTEN loss rates) within an identical cohort of prostate cancer. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated PTEN hemizygous deletions in 5.5% (5/90) of cases. All cases with hemizygous deletions presented a distinct loss of PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry and were unanimously identified as PTEN loss by all participants (sensitivity 100%). However, negative (loss) immunohistochemistry was relatively non-specific for an underlying genomic deletion. Improved inter-observer agreement was observed in a subsequent ring trial. Finally, we identify S473-pAKT immunohistochemistry as a useful marker in equivocal cases. In summary, this multi-institutional ring trial illustrates surprisingly heterogeneous outcomes in defining PTEN status by immunohistochemistry."
39652574,Plasma Cell-Free DNA Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Profiling Depicts Phenotypic and Clinical Heterogeneity in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Cell phenotype underlies prostate cancer presentation and treatment resistance and can be regulated by epigenomic features. However, the osteotropic tendency of prostate cancer limits access to metastatic tissue, meaning most prior insights into prostate cancer chromatin biology are from preclinical models that do not fully represent disease complexity. Noninvasive chromatin immunoprecipitation of histones in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in humans may enable the capture of disparate prostate cancer phenotypes. In this study, we analyzed activating promoter- and enhancer-associated H3K4me2 from cfDNA in metastatic prostate cancer enriched for divergent patterns of metastasis and diverse clinical presentation. H3K4me2 density across prostate cancer genes, accessible chromatin, and lineage-defining transcription factor-binding sites correlated strongly with ctDNA fraction-demonstrating capture of prostate cancer-specific biology and informing the development of a statistical framework to adjust for ctDNA fraction. Chromatin hallmarks mirrored synchronously measured clinicogenomic features: bone- versus liver-predominant disease, serum PSA, biopsy-confirmed histopathologic subtype, and RB1 deletions convergently indicated phenotype segregation along an axis of differential androgen receptor activity and neuroendocrine identity. Detection of lineage switching after sequential progression on systemic therapy in select patients indicates potential use for individualized resistance monitoring. Epigenomic footprints of metastasis-induced normal tissue destruction were evident in bulk cfDNA from two patients. Finally, a public epigenomic resource was generated using a distinct chromatin marker that has not been widely investigated in prostate cancer. These results provide insights into the adaptive molecular landscape of aggressive prostate cancer and endorse plasma cfDNA chromatin profiling as a biomarker source and biological discovery tool. Significance: Plasma cell-free chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing enables phenotypic dissection of lethal prostate cancer and is a practical tool for biomarker discovery while overcoming prior limitations of access to relevant tissue and reliance on model systems."
39650727,Spatial transcriptomics identifies RBM39 as a gene associated with Gleason score progression in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) exhibits significant intratumor heterogeneity, frequently manifesting as a multifocal disease. This study utilized Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) to explore transcriptome patterns in PCa regions with varying Gleason scores (GSs). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Louvain clustering analysis revealed transcriptomic classifications aligned with the histology of different GSs. The increasing degree of tumor malignancy during GS progression was validated using inferred copy number variation (inferCNV) analysis. Diffusion pseudotime (DPT) and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) analyses predicted the developmental trajectories among distinct clusters. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis through pairwise comparisons of various GSs identified genes associated with GS progression. Validation with The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset confirmed the differential expression of RBM39, a finding further supported by cytological and histological experiments. These findings enhance our understanding of GS evolution through spatial transcriptomics and highlight RBM39 as a gene associated with GS progression."
39650230,Overexpression of HYOU1 is associated with cisplatin resistance and may depend on m(6)A modification in patients with cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortalities among women worldwide. The chemotherapeutical platinum-based agent cisplatin (DDP) is the standard therapy for locally advanced or recurrent CC; however, platinum resistance limits its clinical benefit. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify key genes associated with DDP resistance in patients with CC and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Firstly, using the CRISPR-Cas9 dataset of CC cells derived from DepMap portal, 699 genes associated with CC cell survival were identified. Subsequently, using the gene expression profiles of normal and CC samples with a response status to DDP, derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), hypoxia upregulated 1 (HYOU1) was further identified as significantly upregulated in CC samples and patients that did not respond to DDP (non-responders) when compared with healthy controls and patients that did respond to DDP (responders), respectively, using unpaired student's t-tests. Additionally, the log-rank test revealed that the high expression of HYOU1 was significantly associated with the poor survival of patients receiving DDP. The association between the high HYOU1 expression levels and the poor survival of patients receiving DDP was validated in the remaining TCGA dataset of patients with CC. HYOU1 expression levels were positively associated with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of DDP in CC cells using data derived from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database. In vitro, western blotting experiments revealed high HYOU1 protein expression levels in DDP-resistant HeLa cells compared with their parental HeLa cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of HYOU1 resulted in an increased sensitivity of HeLa cells to DDP. Finally, using the sequence-based RNA adenosine methylation site predictor program, it was found that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) was highly enriched in HYOU1. The expression levels of the m(6)A reader, EIF3A, was positively correlated with the expression levels of HYOU1 and was upregulated in the non-response group compared with the response group in a dataset from TCGA database. Additionally, EIF3A had the highest probability of binding to the m(6)A motifs of HYOU1 compared with other genes. In GSE56363 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, the non-responders had significantly increased expression levels of EIF3A compared with the responders. In conclusion, high expression levels of HYOU1, which may be regulated by EIF3A due to m(6)A modifications, was associated with DDP resistance in patients with CC and could potentially be used as an indicator of DDP treatment resistance."
39647634,Cancer-associated fibroblasts regulate mitochondrial metabolism and inhibit chemosensitivity via ANGPTL4-IQGAP1 axis in prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a critical component of the tumor microenvironment, being implicated in enhancing tumor growth and fostering drug resistance. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying their function in prostate cancer (PCa) remain incompletely understood, which is essential for devising effective therapeutic strategies. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to explore the mechanisms by which CAFs mediate PCa growth and chemoresistance. METHODS: We validated through data analysis and experimentation that CAFs significantly impact PCa cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the conditioned media from CAFs and PCa cells and identified angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) as a key factor. We employed ELISA and multiplex immunofluorescence assays, all of which indicated that ANGPTL4 was primarily secreted by CAFs.Next, we conducted metabolomics analysis, GST pull-down assays, Co-IP, and other experiments to explore the specific molecular mechanisms of ANGPTL4 and its precise effects on PCa cells. Through drug screening, we identified Quercetin 3-O-(6'-galactopyranosyl)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (QGGP) as an effective inhibitor of CAFs function. Finally, we thoroughly assessed the therapeutic potential of QGGP both as a monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel in PCa cells. RESULTS: We discovered that the extracrine factor ANGPTL4 is primarily expressed in CAFs in PCa. When ANGPTL4 binds to IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) on the PCa cell membrane, it activates the Raf-MEK-ERK-PGC1alpha axis, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS metabolism, and thereby facilitating PCa growth and chemoresistance. Furthermore, virtual and functional screening strategies identified QGGP as a specific inhibitor of IQGAP1 that promotes its degradation. Combined with docetaxel treatment, QGGP can reverse the effects of CAFs and improve the responsiveness of PCa to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers a paracrine mechanism of chemoresistance in PCa and proposes that targeting the stroma could be a therapeutic choice."
39647188,Association between genomic instability score and progression-free/overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed non-BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the association between genomic instability score (GIS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed, non-BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer. METHODS: Homologous recombinant deficiency (HRD) status was based on a cutoff of >/=42 GIS; patients <42 were categorized with homologous recombination proficiency (HRP). We collected type and duration of maintenance therapy, among other variables, and built a multivariate model with landmark analysis at 6 months from baseline and applied it for time-dependent variables. RESULTS: Increasing GIS as a continuous variable was associated with improved PFS and OS in our cohort. Overall, median PFS was significantly longer in patients with HRD ovarian cancer (35.4 months, 25.4-NE) than in those with HRP disease (14.9 months, 13.1-16.2; p < 0.001). Median OS was 36.2 months (32.4-NE) for HRP and not reached for HRD (p = 0.002). Notably, in patients with HRP ovarian cancer, we observed a shorter median PFS in those who received a poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) than in those who did not (12.7 months for HRP with PARPi vs 15.2 months for HRP without PARPi). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that in newly diagnosed advanced non-BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer, GIS as a continuous variable is associated with longer PFS and OS. In patients with HRP ovarian cancer, PARPi treatment may be associated with shorter PFS, which warrants further evaluation."
39645377,"Burden of disease scenarios by state in the USA, 2022-50: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. METHODS: We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). FINDINGS: Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78.3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78.1-78.5) in 2022 to 79.9 years (79.5-80.2) in 2035, and to 80.4 years (79.8-81.0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19.5% [6.9-34.1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3.8 additional years (3.6-4.0) of life expectancy and 4.1 additional years (3.9-4.3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0.4 additional years (0.3-0.6) of life expectancy and 0.6 additional years (0.5-0.8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0.4-0.5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12.4 million (11.3-13.5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1.4 million (0.7-2.2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2.1 million (1.3-2.9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1.2 million (0.9-1.5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

39644909,Geographical variation in the incidence of colorectal cancer and urinary tract cancer is associated with population exposure to colibactin-producing Escherichia coli.,"Biomedical research has implicated the bacterial metabolite colibactin as a causal risk factor for several cancer types, in particular, colorectal cancer. Colibactin has been known to drive tumorigenesis by inducing double-strand breaks in the DNA of epithelial cells exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria. Some phylogroup B2 Escherichia coli secrete colibactin during interbacterial warfare, concomitantly exposing the host to an increasing risk of DNA damage. This Personal View reviews the current knowledge about the cancer-colibactin interface and summarises metagenomics-based and population-genomics-based surveys to show that the prevalence of dominant colibactin-producing lineages of E coli varies considerably across geographical regions. The prevalence is further strongly associated with the age-standardised incidences of colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, and prostate cancer, suggesting that the degree of colibactin exposure in a population might contribute to the geographical variation of these cancers. Our observations provide a strong impetus for further research and the development of novel interventions to reduce the risks for colibactin-related cancers."
39643241,The HPV101 E7 protein shares host cellular targets and biological activities with high-risk HPV16 E7.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a diverse family of viruses with over 450 members that have been identified and fully sequenced. They are classified into five phylogenetic genera: alpha, beta, gamma, mu, and nu. The high-risk alpha HPVs, such as HPV16, have been studied the most extensively due to their medical significance as cancer-causing agents. However, while nearly 70% of all HPVs are members of the gamma genus, they are almost entirely unstudied. This is because gamma HPVs have been considered medically irrelevant commensals as most of them infect the skin and are not known to cause significant clinical lesions in immunocompetent individuals. Members of the gamma 6 HPVs, however, have been detected in the anogenital tract mucosa and HPV101 has been isolated from a premalignant cervical lesion. Moreover, gamma 6 HPVs have a unique genome structure. They lack E6 proteins but in place of E6, they encode unique, small hydrophobic proteins without any close viral or cellular homologs that have been termed E10. Here, we report that HPV101 E7 shares biochemical activities with the high-risk alpha HPV16 E7, including the ability to target the pRB and PTPN14 tumor suppressors for degradation. This study underscores the importance of further characterizing HPV101 and other unstudied HPV species."
39643184,Harnessing machine learning and multi-omics to explore tumor evolutionary characteristics and the role of AMOTL1 in prostate cancer.,"Although recent advancements have shed light on the crucial role of coordinated evolution among cell subpopulations in influencing disease progression, the full potential of these insights has not yet been fully harnessed in the clinical application of personalized precision medicine for prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we utilized single-cell sequencing to identify the evolutionary characteristics of tumoral cell states and employed comprehensive bulk RNA sequencing to evaluate their potential as prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we integrated machine learning with multi-omics to develop and validate the tumor evolutionary characteristic predictive indicator (TECPI). TECPI not only demonstrated superior prognostic performance compared to traditional clinical predictors and 81 previously published models but also improved patient outcomes by accurately identifying individuals who would benefit from immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Furthermore, we experimentally validated the critical role of AMOTL1 in PCa pharmacodynamics through its interaction with AR, pivotal for modulating the sensitivity to AR antagonist. Additionally, we demonstrated the generalizability and applicability of TECPI across pan-cancers. In summary, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding cellular diversity and dynamics within the tumor microenvironment to predict PCa progression and to guide targeted therapy effectively."
39642328,Cancer-Control Outcomes of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer With BRCA Gene or Tumor Suppressor Mutations Undergoing 177-Lutetium Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy.,"PURPOSE: Several tumor gene mutations are known for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The individual response to 177-lutetium prostate specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy (Lu-PSMA) is under current investigation regarding the genomic profile of patients with mCRPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We relied on the FRAMCAP database and compared progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of patients with mCRPC with breast cancer-related antigen (BRCA) or tumor suppressor gene mutations (TP53, PTEN, RB1). Specifically, subgroup analyses were performed for patients with Lu-PSMA-treated mCRPC. RESULTS: Of 194 patients with mCRPC, 22% was BRCA1/2 versus 14% PTEN/TP53/RB1 versus 63% without one of these mutations. Patients with no mutation harbored a significantly lower Gleason score of 8-10, relative to BRCA and PTEN/TP53/RB1 patients. In PFS analyses of first-line mCRPC, no difference between all three groups was observed, whereas the median OS differed significantly with 46.3 versus 48.7 versus 95.4 months for BRCA versus PTEN/TP53/RB1 versus no mutated patients (P < .05). In univariable Cox regression models, BRCA-mutated patients were at higher risk of death (hazard ratio, 2.57; P < .01), whereas PTEN/TP53/RB1 patients were not (P = .4). Of 87 patients with Lu-PSMA-treated mCRPC, significant differences in PFS and OS were observed (both P </= .02). In univariable and multivariable Cox regression models, BRCA-mutated Lu-PSMA patients were at higher risk of death, whereas PTEN/TP53/RB1 patients had similar outcomes as no mutated patients. CONCLUSION: In real-world setting, substantially lower OS in mCRPC is observed for BRCA- and PTEN/TP53/RB1-mutated patients, whereas no difference in first-line PFS could be computed. In Lu-PSMA-treated patients, worst outcomes were observed for BRCA patients."
39641316,Enhanced proteomic profiling of human plasma-derived extracellular vesicles through charge-based fractionation to advance biomarker discovery potential.,"The study introduces a charge-based fractionation method for fractionating plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) into sub-populations aimed at the improved purification from free plasma proteins to enhance the diagnostic potential of EV sub-populations for specific pathophysiological states. Here, we present a novel approach for EV fractionation that leverages EVs' inherent surface charges, differentiating them from other plasma components and, thus, reducing the sample complexity and increasing the purity of EVs. The developed method was optimized and thoroughly evaluated using proteomic analysis, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking, and western blotting of isolated EVs from healthy donors. Subsequently, we pilot-tested the developed technique for its applicability to real-world specimens using a small set of clinical prostate cancer samples and matched controls. The presented technique demonstrates the effective isolation and fractionation of EV sub-populations based on their surface charge, which may potentially help enhance EV-based diagnostics, biomarker discovery, and basic biology research. The method is designed to be straightforward, scalable, easy-to-use, and it does not require specialized skills or equipment."
39640032,Genetic Variants and Haplotype Structures in the CASC Gene Family to Predict Cancer Risk: A Bioinformatics Study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The cancer susceptibility (CASC) gene family of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays an important role in cancer. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants and haplotype structures of CASC genes associated with cancer risk. METHODS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) significant variants (p </= 5 x 10(-8)) on CASC family genes were identified from the GWAS Catalog-EMBL-EBI, and then cancer-associated variants on CASC genes were extracted. These variants were functionally analyzed, including lncRNA:miRNA binding sites, Regulomedb scores, and eQTL. The 1000 Genome Project genotyping data Phase III were used to identify haplotypic blocks. Finally, the genes associated with them were examined for expression and gene-gene correlation analyses using OncoDB. RESULTS: There were six haplotypic blocks in four genes. The GC, TA, and AGAC haplotypes are located in the CASC8 gene and increase the risk of prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, respectively. The CA haplotype in the CASC15 gene increases the risk of neuroblastoma, AA haplotype in the CASC16 gene increases the risk of breast cancer, and ACGATG haplotype in the CASC17 gene increases the risk of prostate cancer (p </= 5 x 10(-8)). Their genes are interrelated and their expression is increased in these cancers. The rs2294214 is associated with skin cancer and has positive effects on five CASC15:miRNA binding sites. The rs3803662 is located in CASC16:miRNA binding sites, which has positive effects on hsa-miR-4475 and hsa-miR-7845-5p and negative effects on hsa-miR-4524a-3p and hsa-miR-4524b-3p. CONCLUSION: These haplotypic structures and lncRNA:miRNA:SNP interactions on CASC family lncRNAs reveal novel genetic associations between CASC genes and various cancers."
39639793,Declining Prevalence of Human Papillomavirus Co-Infections Among Young Japanese Women With Cervical Cancer and Its Precursors.,"Co-infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) of multiple genotypes mainly occur due to increased sexual activity. To address the prevalence and trend of HPV co-infections in Japan, HPV-type-specific data from Japanese women (n = 8128) aged < 40 years and newly diagnosed with cervical abnormalities at 24 hospitals between 2012 and 2023 were analyzed. These included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/2 (CIN1/2, n = 2745), CIN3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) (n = 3953), and invasive cervical cancer (ICC, n = 1430). For women enrolled in this study since 2019, information on sexual behaviors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Time-trend analyses by disease category showed significant declines in the prevalence of multiple HPV infections in CIN1/2 (49.1%-38.3%, p(trend) = 0.0004), CIN3/AIS (44.7%-31.5%, p(trend) = 0.0002), and ICC (26.7%-10.5%, p(trend) < 0.0001) during the last decade. When these data were analyzed separately for women aged 20-29 and 30-39 years, similar declining trends were observed in each disease category. Using data from 2111 women for whom information on sexual history was available, the number of sexual partners was strongly associated with increased multiple HPV infections (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the declining prevalence of HPV co-infections in cervical cancer and its precursors may reflect a decrease in sexual activity among Japanese women of reproductive age."
39639045,Influence of aging and maternal protein restriction on PIWI-interacting RNA expression in the offspring rat ventral prostate.,"The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept explores the link between exposure to adverse conditions during fetal and early childhood development and the onset of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as prostate cancer (PCa). Changes in epigenetics that control gene expression have been identified as potential contributors to the developmental origin of PCa. Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), for example, control transposable elements (TEs) and maintain genome integrity in germ cells. However, stress-induced deregulation of TEs warrants investigating the role of piRNAs in the prostate gland from the DOHaD perspective, which remains underexplored. This study aimed to detect and characterize piRNA expression in the ventral prostate (VP) of Sprague Dawley rat offspring at 21 postnatal days (PND21) and PND540. The rats were subjected to maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation to understand its impact on prostate development and aging. Histological analyses showed that the gestational and lactation low-protein diet (GLLP) group experienced a delay in prostate gland development, with increased stromal and epithelial compartments and decreased luminal compartments during early life. Aging in this group resulted in decreased luminal compartments and increased stromal areas. Epithelial atrophy was observed in both groups, with an increased incidence of carcinoma in situ in the GLLP group. Small RNA sequencing from control and restricted groups (at PND21 and PND540) identified piRNA clusters in both young and aged animals. We also detected the expression of PIWI genes (Riwi, Rili, Rili2) in the prostate. Our data highlight the key role of maternal malnutrition in modulating piRNA expression in the offspring's VP, with the potential to influence prostate developmental biology and the risk of prostatic disorders with aging."
39638730,Novel Methods to Assess Tumor Burden and Minimal Residual Disease in Genitourinary Cancers.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Advances in molecular diagnostics have ushered in a new era for patients with prostate, renal, and urothelial cancers, with novel radiographic and molecular modalities for the assessment of disease burden and minimal residual disease (MRD). Conventional imaging has a limited threshold for disease detection and is often unable to discern clinically occult disease with varying risks of false-negative or false-positive findings depending on the disease state and type of imaging. METHODS: We provide an overview of emerging radiographic and molecular tools in development within the genitourinary (GU) disease space. A literature review of contemporary basic, translational, and clinical research studies was performed, covering the timeframe of 1980-2024 through the MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Scopus databases. We highlight select examples of emerging technologies and biomarker-informed clinical trials, which aim to quantify disease at lower thresholds and have the potential for integrating MRD in clinical practice for GU patients. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The development of novel radiotracers, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen or carbonic anhydrase IX, is being evaluated in both clinical practice and trial setting, aiming to change the management of these tumors. Molecular tools including circulating tumor cells and byproducts such as plasma and urine cell-free circulating tumor DNA provide the opportunity for MRD detection. MRD capture on single-cell or cellular byproducts can serve as a conduit for genomic and transcriptomic analyses, providing insight into the molecular underpinnings and clonal evolution of disease. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: While the full potential for MRD applications has yet to be realized, we are witnessing the emergence of novel techniques aimed at MRD detection and the rapid development of elegantly designed studies implementing iterative detection of MRD as means to provide biological rationale and tailor therapeutic options in GU tumors."
39638560,Rearrangements of viral and human genomes at human papillomavirus integration events and their allele-specific impacts on cancer genome regulation.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) integration has been implicated in transforming HPV infection into cancer. To resolve genome dysregulation associated with HPV integration, we performed Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing on 72 cervical cancer genomes from a Ugandan data set that was previously characterized using short-read sequencing. We find recurrent structural rearrangement patterns at HPV integration events, which we categorize as del(etion)-like, dup(lication)-like, translocation, multi-breakpoint, or repeat region integrations. Integrations involving amplified HPV-human concatemers, particularly multi-breakpoint events, frequently harbor heterogeneous forms and copy numbers of the viral genome. Transcriptionally active integrants are characterized by unmethylated regions in both the viral and human genomes downstream from the viral transcription start site, resulting in HPV-human fusion transcripts. In contrast, integrants without evidence of expression lack consistent methylation patterns. Furthermore, whereas transcriptional dysregulation is limited to genes within 200 kb of an HPV integrant, dysregulation of the human epigenome in the form of allelic differentially methylated regions affects megabase expanses of the genome, irrespective of the integrant's transcriptional status. By elucidating the structural, epigenetic, and allele-specific impacts of HPV integration, we provide insight into the role of integrated HPV in cervical cancer."
39636855,DPF2 reads histone lactylation to drive transcription and tumorigenesis.,"Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a new type of histone mark implicated in the regulation of various functional processes such as transcription. However, how this histone mark acts in cancers remains unexplored due in part to a lack of knowledge about its reader proteins. Here, we observe that cervical cancer (CC) cells undergo metabolic reprogram by which lactate accumulation and thereby boosts histone lactylation, particularly H3K14la. Utilizing a multivalent photoaffinity probe in combination with quantitative proteomics approach, we identify DPF2 as a candidate target of H3K14la. Biochemical studies as well as CUT&Tag analysis reveal that DPF2 is capable of binding to H3K14la and colocalizes with it on promoters of oncogenic genes. Notably, disrupting the DPF2-H3K14la interaction through structure-guided mutation blunts those cancer-related gene expression along with cell survival. Together, our findings reveal DPF2 as a bona fide H3K14la effector that couples histone lactylation to gene transcription and cell survival, offering insight into how histone Kla engages in transcription and tumorigenesis."
39636577,Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: A clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).,"PURPOSE: ATM germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) are associated with a moderately increased risk of female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Resources for managing ATM heterozygotes in clinical practice are limited. METHODS: An international workgroup developed a clinical practice resource to guide management of ATM heterozygotes using peer-reviewed publications and expert opinion. RESULTS: Although ATM is a moderate (intermediate) penetrance gene, cancer risks may be considered as a continuous variable, influenced by family history and other modifiers. ATM GPV heterozygotes should generally be offered enhanced breast surveillance according to their personalized risk estimate and country-specific guidelines and, generally, risk-reducing mastectomy is not recommended. Prostate cancer surveillance should be considered. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered based on assessment of family history, ideally as part of a clinical trial, with existence of country-specific guidelines. For ATM GPV heterozygotes who develop cancer, radiation therapy decisions should not be influenced by the genetic result. Although poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors are licensed for use in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and ATM GPVs, the evidence-base is currently weak. CONCLUSION: Systematic prospective data collection is needed to establish the spectrum of ATM-associated cancer and determine the outlines of surveillance, response to cancer treatment, and survival."
39636451,BUD23 promote the cell proliferation ability by affecting the PPAR signaling pathways: evidence from the online dataset and cell experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is a major public health challenge for men worldwide, being the second most common cancer diagnosis and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. The etiology of prostate cancer is multifactorial, with age, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors playing critical roles. The role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in prostate cancer remains complex and not fully elucidated. METHODS: Transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were utilized for this study. The data were analyzed using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). A prognosis-prediction model was constructed using Cox regression and LASSO analysis. Functional experiments, including Western blotting, quantitative PCR (qPCR), Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, and EdU incorporation assays, were performed to validate the role of BUD23 in prostate cancer. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the immune microenvironment and HLA gene expression profiles between high and low PPAR expression groups in prostate cancer. The high PPAR group exhibited a less active immune microenvironment with higher fractions of immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs). A robust prognostic model identified key genes, including BUD23, associated with patient survival. Elevated BUD23 expression was correlated with more aggressive clinical features such as advanced pathological stages, nodal metastasis, and higher Gleason scores. Knockdown of BUD23 in PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Western blotting and qPCR confirmed effective BUD23 knockdown, and CCK-8 and EdU assays demonstrated reduced cell proliferation. BUD23 knockdown resulted in significant reductions in PPAR-alpha, PPAR-beta, and PPAR-gamma protein levels, suggesting a regulatory axis between BUD23 and PPARs in prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the distinct roles of PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma in prostate cancer progression and their potential as therapeutic targets. Elevated BUD23 expression is associated with aggressive prostate cancer features and patient survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker. The knockdown of BUD23 not only inhibited cell proliferation but also reduced the expression of PPAR-related proteins, indicating a potential regulatory axis between BUD23 and PPARs. These findings suggest that targeting BUD23 could modulate PPAR signaling and inhibit tumor growth in prostate cancer."
39635522,Immunome profiling in prostate cancer: a guide for clinicians.,"Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a key role to understand how tumors respond to prostate cancer (PC) therapies and potential mechanisms of resistance. Previous research has suggested that specific genomic aberrations, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) or CDK12 bi-allelic loss can allow PC patients more likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) or other immune therapies. However, responses to these treatments remain highly variable even in selected patients. Thus, it is essential to obtain more information about tumor immune cells that infiltrate these tumors, and on their plasticity and interactions, in order to better understand the underlying biology to allow development of new therapeutic strategies. This review analyzes: 1) How interactions among immune cell populations and other cells infiltrating the tumor stroma can modulate the progression of PC, 2) How the standard therapies to treat PC (such as androgen deprivation therapy, new androgen-directed hormone therapy or chemotherapy) may influence the dynamic changes of the immunome and 3) What are the limitations in characterizing the immune landscape of the host s response to tumors."
39633050,Evolution of myeloid-mediated immunotherapy resistance in prostate cancer.,"Patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)(1,2), partly because there are immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumours(3,4). However, the heterogeneity of myeloid cells has made them difficult to target, making blockade of the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) clinically ineffective. Here we use single-cell profiling on patient biopsies across the disease continuum and find that a distinct population of tumour-associated macrophages with elevated levels of SPP1 transcripts (SPP1(hi)-TAMs) becomes enriched with the progression of prostate cancer to mCRPC. In syngeneic mouse modelling, an analogous macrophage population suppresses CD8(+) T cell activity in vitro and promotes ICI resistance in vivo. Furthermore, Spp1(hi)-TAMs are not responsive to anti-CSF1R antibody treatment. Pathway analysis identifies adenosine signalling as a potential mechanism for SPP1(hi)-TAM-mediated immunotherapeutic resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) significantly reverses Spp1(hi)-TAM-mediated immunosuppression in CD8(+) T cells in vitro and enhances CRPC responsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in vivo. Consistent with preclinical results, inhibition of A2ARs using ciforadenant in combination with programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade using atezolizumab induces clinical responses in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, inhibiting A2ARs results in a significant decrease in SPP1(hi)-TAM abundance in CRPC, indicating that this pathway is involved in both induction and downstream immunosuppression. Collectively, these findings establish SPP1(hi)-TAMs as key mediators of ICI resistance in mCRPC through adenosine signalling, emphasizing their importance as both a therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy."
39632531,Necrosis-Related lncRNAs: Biomarker Screening and Prognostic Prediction for Hot and Cold Tumours of Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The objectives of this work were the search for novel prognostic biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and the improvement of therapy outcomes in cases with a poor prognosis and the failure of immunotherapy. METHODS: The GTEx (Genotypic Tissue Expression Project) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) databases were used to find out the co-expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with necrosis status based on statistics and univariate Cox regression tests. IncRNA associated with necrosis was screened by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis, and the predictive model was further verified by Kaplan-Meier analysis, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Cox regression, nomogram and calibration curve. Also, immune analysis, principle component analysis, gene set enrichment analysis and prediction of semi-maximum inhibitory concentration in risk groups were conducted. RESULTS: The model successfully identified 16 necrosis-related lncRNA models, demonstrating good consistency among the calibration map and prognosis expectation. The ROC curve's area under the curve (AUC) for 1-year overall survival was 0.726, 0.763 and 0.770. The risk groups identified by the model could guide systematic treatment due to significant differences in semi-inhibitory concentrations. The study also demonstrated that the model could differentiate amongst hot and cold tumours and provide accurate mediation, with cluster 2 recognised as a hot tumour and likely to benefit from immunotherapy drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the given study supports the potential of necrosis-related lncRNAs as a biomarker for predicting the prognosis and personalised treatment for PCa."
39632396,Associations of the Expression Levels and Risk Variants of CDKN2B-AS1 Long Noncoding RNA With the Susceptibility and Progression of Prostate Cancer.,"Genetic variants of deregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in tumorigenesis, cancer progression and cancer recurrence. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the lncRNA cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1) have been associated with the risk and progression of various cancers; however, their role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains underexplored. In this case-control study, we investigated the associations of CDKN2B-AS1 expression levels and variants with PCa risk and progression. For this, five SNPs of CDKN2B-AS1-rs564398, rs1333048, rs1537373, rs2151280 and rs8181047-were genotyped using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay; data were collected from 695 patients with PCa and 695 healthy controls. Our findings revealed that, under a dominant model, patients with PCa carrying at least one minor C allele of rs1333048 exhibited an increased risk of developing tumours with high Gleason grades; this risk was particularly high in patients without biochemical recurrence. Data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression database indicated upregulated CDKN2B-AS1 expression in the prostates of individuals carrying the polymorphic C allele of rs1333048. Genotype screening of rs1333048 in PCa cell lines showed that cells with at least one minor C allele had higher CDKN2B-AS1 levels than those with the AA genotype. Furthermore, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated that higher CDKN2B-AS1 levels in PCa tissues were correlated with larger tumour sizes (T3 + T4), more lymph node metastasis (N1), higher Gleason scores and shorter progression-free survival. In conclusion, the polymorphic variants of CDKN2B-AS1 at rs1333048 may modulate CDKN2B-AS1 expression, thus accelerating PCa progression."
39631757,DysRegNet: Patient-specific and confounder-aware dysregulated network inference towards precision therapeutics.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gene regulation is frequently altered in diseases in unique and patient-specific ways. Hence, personalised strategies have been proposed to infer patient-specific gene-regulatory networks. However, existing methods do not scale well because they often require recomputing the entire network per sample. Moreover, they do not account for clinically important confounding factors such as age, sex or treatment history. Finally, a user-friendly implementation for the analysis and interpretation of such networks is missing. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We present DysRegNet, a method for inferring patient-specific regulatory alterations (dysregulations) from bulk gene expression profiles. We compared DysRegNet to the well-known SSN method, considering patient clustering, promoter methylation, mutations and cancer-stage data. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrate that both SSN and DysRegNet produce interpretable and biologically meaningful networks across various cancer types. In contrast to SSN, DysRegNet can scale to arbitrary sample numbers and highlights the importance of confounders in network inference, revealing an age-specific bias in gene regulation in breast cancer. DysRegNet is available as a Python package (https://github.com/biomedbigdata/DysRegNet_package), and analysis results for 11 TCGA cancer types are available through an interactive web interface (https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/dysregnet). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: DysRegNet introduces a novel bioinformatics tool enabling confounder-aware and patient-specific network analysis to unravel regulatory alteration in complex diseases."
39630373,Prevalence of SPOP and IDH Gene Mutations in Prostate Cancer in a Jordanian Population.,"Speckle-type POZ (SPOP) is described as an essential tumor suppressor factor in gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer (PCa). SPOP gene mutations were reported in primary human PCa. Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) oncogene mutations were detected in gliomas, acute myeloid leukemia, some benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors, and only 1% of PCa. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mutations of SPOP and IDH1 genes in PCa in the Jordanian population. One hundred formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were collected from patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma. The obtained specimens were subjected to genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and direct sequencing of exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the SPOP gene and exon 6 of the IDH1 gene. SPOP gene mutations were found in 17% of PCa cases, while no mutation was detected in the screened exon 6 of the IDH1 gene. Clinicopathological data demonstrated a strong correlation between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and both Gleason score (GS) and the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG). There was no significant correlation between PSA levels and age (p = 0.816) nor there were significant associations for SPOP mutational status with age (p = 0.659), PSA levels (p = 0.395), GS (p = 0.259), and ISUP GG (p = 0.424) in the tested population. The study found a strong correlation between PSA levels and both GS and ISUP GG. It also identified a high frequency (17%) of SPOP gene mutations in Jordanian Arab PCa patients, mainly in exon 7. No IDH1 mutations were detected in exon 6."
39630279,Molecular characterization of ovarian squamous cell carcinoma originating from mature teratoma.,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the ovary, an uncommon form of gynecologic cancer, typically originates from the malignant transformation of a pre-existing mature ovarian teratoma (MOT). However, due to its rarity, the molecular pathways driving its development are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed molecular inversion probe (MIP) array analysis and targeted sequencing of 275 cancer susceptibility genes on 11 ovarian SCC samples derived from MOTs. Additionally, we conducted the same molecular tests on two samples of ovarian metastases of SCCs that originated from primary sites outside the ovary, specifically, one from endometrial cancer and one from cervical SCC. Utilizing MIP arrays, we identified failures in meiosis I and II, as well as instances of endoreduplication within haploid ova, in five, two, and four samples of ovarian SCCs arising from MOTs, respectively. Notably, such alterations were absent in samples of ovarian metastases, implying that primary ovarian SCCs may derive from teratoma cells. Targeted sequencing identified TP53 as the most frequently mutated gene in ovarian SCCs, occurring in 82% of cases. This was followed by mutations in PIK3CA (36%), PTEN (27%), and KMT2D (27%). Furthermore, mutations in CDKN2A and copy number loss of 9p21.3 were observed in 54.5% of the cohort. In summary, our study elucidates the germ cell origin of ovarian SCC and provides a comprehensive analysis of its genomic landscape, which may assist in differential diagnosis and inform the development of targeted therapies with potential clinical benefits. KEY MESSAGES: Failures in meiosis I/II and endoreduplication found in primary ovarian SCCs.  Ovarian SCCs may derive from germ cells in mature teratomas.  Alterations absent in ovarian metastases from SCC aid differential diagnosis. TP53 mutations found in 82% of ovarian SCC cases. CDKN2A mutations and 9p21.3 loss observed in 54.5% of ovarian SCC cohort."
39628685,Genetic variants of ADAM9 as potential predictors for biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients after receiving a radical prostatectomy.,"A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) functions as a membranous bridge, forming cell-cell and cell-matrix connections that regulate tumor aggressiveness in various cancer types, including prostate cancer (PCa). Elevated ADAM9 levels in PCa were identified as a prognostic marker for biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy (RP). However, impacts of genetic variants of ADAM9 on clinicopathological development and BCR remain unclear. Herein, we recruited 702 patients with PCa to evaluate associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADAM9 with the risk of BCR and clinicopathological development. We genotyped four loci of ADAM9 SNPs located in the promoter and intron regions using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, including rs10105311 (C/T), rs7006414 (T/C), rs6474526 (T/G), and rs78451751 (T/C) in 702 Taiwanese PCa patients. Our results showed that the risk of postoperative BCR was 1.508-fold higher in patients carrying the T/C genotype in ADAM9 rs7006414 compared to those with the homozygous T/T genotype, a phenomenon more pronounced in younger PCa patients (aged </= 65 years). Furthermore, patients with at least one polymorphic G allele in ADAM9 rs6474526 had a 2.016-fold increased risk of developing an advanced clinical primary tumor stage, particularly in a subpopulation without BCR. Clinical observations from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database showed increased ADAM9 expression in whole blood tissues among individuals carrying the polymorphic C allele of rs7006414 and the G allele of rs6474526. Additionally, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated that elevated ADAM9 levels were observed in PCa tissues compared to corresponding matched normal tissues. Our findings suggest that the rs7006414 and rs6474526 genetic variants of ADAM9 may influence ADAM9 expression and are associated with BCR and clinicopathological development in PCa patients after an RP."
39628067,Comparative analysis of gut microbiota in hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japanese men.,"Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, with previous studies indicating that certain bacterial taxa are more abundant in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Notably, the composition of gut microbiota can vary significantly by geographic region, and Japanese individuals have a distinct microbial profile. However, research exploring these differences within Japanese populations remains limited. This study investigated the gut microbiota differences between Japanese men with HSPC and CRPC and further validated these findings using a transgenic mouse model. Rectal swab samples were collected from 140 Japanese men diagnosed with HSPC (n = 84) or CRPC (n = 56) between September 2020 and July 2022. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, Pten-KO mice, which model the progression from HSPC to CRPC, underwent similar microbiota analysis. Results revealed significant differences in gut microbiota composition between HSPC and CRPC patients. Specifically, the CRPC group showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes, including Gemella and Lactobacillus, compared to the HSPC group. These differences were mirrored in the mouse model, where CRPC mice also showed an increase in these bacteria. This study identifies distinct microbial differences between HSPC and CRPC in Japanese men, suggesting that Gemella and Lactobacillus may be associated with the progression to castration resistance in prostate cancer. These findings suggest that gut microbiota differences may be associated with prostate cancer progression. Further research is needed to explore the potential of targeting the microbiota as a therapeutic strategy."
39626912,Immunohistochemical Expression and Significance of Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) in Gynecological Tumors: A Single-institution Retrospective Analysis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Although preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has been used as a diagnostic marker for malignant melanoma (MM), it is also expressed in various other malignancies. PRAME expression is rarely reported in female genital tumors. This study aimed to evaluate PRAME expression and its significance in gynecological malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted PRAME immunostaining in 135 specimens, including 85 endometrial carcinomas (ECs), five uterine sarcomas (USs), 28 cervical carcinomas (CCs), and 17 ovarian carcinomas (OCs). PRAME immunoreactivity was evaluated using a semi-quantitative histoscore method. RESULTS: PRAME was expressed in 82 (96.5%) ECs, 15 (88.2%) OCs, three (60.0%) USs, and eight (28.6%) CCs, with mean histoscores of 174.6, 108.9, 32.2, and 27.5, respectively. EC exhibited elevated PRAME expression levels compared to other tumors, with immunoreactivity being higher in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) than that in other EC types. Grade 1 EEC exhibited higher PRAME expression levels than grade 2-3 EECs. CONCLUSION: PRAME over-expression in gynecological tumors supports the notion that this marker should not be regarded as specific to MM alone. EC exhibited higher PRAME expression than CC and OC, and low-grade EEC displayed higher PRAME immunoreactivity than other EC types. Our findings suggest that PRAME immunostaining can be useful to distinguish EEC from ovarian endometrioid carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma. PRAME over-expression can also help differentiate non-aggressive EC from aggressive EC."
39626157,Multigene Copy Number Alteration Risk Score Biomarker-Based Enrichment Study Designs in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: A composite multigene risk score derived from tumor-biology alterations specific to metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) state was evaluated as a classifier to design biomarker-based enrichment clinical trials. METHODS: A plasma cell-free DNA copy number alteration risk score based on alterations in 24 genes was simulated to develop a biomarker classifier-based clinical trial design enriched for high-risk patients to detect a survival advantage of a novel treatment (hazard ratio of 0.70 with 80% power). We determined the design trade-offs between the number of patients screened and enrolled when varying the type of patients to enrich and the extent of enrichment needed. RESULTS: For a 2-year overall survival end point in mCRPC state, fully enriching patients with mCRPC having a high-risk score of 3 or more (the 95th percentile of a range of risk scores in patients with mCRPC) was determined to require screening to a maximum of 4,149 patients to enroll 259 patients for the targeted effect size. A nonenriched trial was determined to require enrolling 689 patients to be equivalently powered. We identified a pragmatic alternative, which is to enrich patients with mCRPC with a risk score of 1 or more (the 67th percentile) and an enrichment fraction of 0.25. This would require screening 658 patients to enroll 584 patients, and it maximizes the ability to detect a difference in treatment effect by risk score. CONCLUSION: A plasma multi-CNA risk score classifier can feasibly be leveraged to design an enrichment trial in mCRPC. Enriching 25% of patients screened with a risk score >1 was observed to be optimal for obtaining an adequately powered, biomarker-based mCRPC-enriched clinical trial."
39625524,Identification and validation of cigarette smoking-related genes in predicting prostate cancer development through bioinformatic analysis and experiments.,"The morbidity and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) are high among elderly men worldwide. Several factors, such as heredity, obesity, and environment are associated with the occurrence of PCa. Cigarette smoking, which is also an important factor in the development of PCa, can lead to genetic alterations and consequently promote PCa development. However, the smoking-induced genetic alterations in PCa are unclear. This study aimed to identify the potential smoking-related genes associated with PCa development. The smoking-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) which included lots of PCa datasets. DEGs were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to identify the hub genes. The pathways in which these hub genes were enriched were identified. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to examine the expression of smoking-related genes in PCa samples and estimate their value in predicting tumor progression and prognosis. In total, 110 smoking-related DEGs were got from GSE68135 dataset which included microarray data of PCa patients with smoking or not and 14 smoking-related key genes associated with PCa were identified from PPI network. The expression of the following seven key genes was altered in TCGA PCa patients: EWSR1, SRSF6, COL6A3, FBLN1, DCN, CYP2J2, and PLA2G2A. EWSR1, SRSF6, FBLN1, and CYP2J2 also influenced PCa progression. Additionally, EWSR1 influenced disease-free survival. In the logistic regression model, CYP2J2, which exhibited the highest risk scores, was identified as the risk gene for PCa. We also found one of the smoking-related genes: EWSR1 was truly upregulated in clinical PCa patients and influenced PCa cells invasion and proliferation. This study identified the function of smoking-related genes involved in the progression of PCa."
39624281,Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of CD73: Explore its association with prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment.,"BACKGROUND: CD73 is adenosine generation molecule, which is involved in the immune regulation. However, the roles of CD73 in the tumor microenvironment remain unknown. METHODS: CD73 expression levels in pan-cancers were analyzed, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Human Protein ALTAS (HPA) databases. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter was used to analyze the prognostic values of CD73. Immune scores in pan-cancers was evaluated by ESTIMATE. TIMER2.0 and UCSCXena were used to explore the correlation between CD73 and immune infiltration/immune checkpoints/tumor mutation burden (TMB)/microsatellite instability (MSI). CD73 expression correlated genes in tumor tissues were screened by using LinkedOmics tool. RESULTS: Firstly, CD73 was significant increased in following cancer types: esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Secondly, high CD73 expression was associated with poor overall survival in patients with breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), CESC, HNSC, liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), LUAD, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), PAAD and STAD. However, in KIRC and UCEC, patients high CD73 expression showed a favorable prognosis. Thirdly, the immune scores of the high CD73 expression in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), BRCA, kidney chromophobe (KICH), LUAD, LUSC, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) were significant higher than that of patients with low CD73 expression. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between CD73 and the multiple immune cells infiltration, including CD4(+) memory T cells, CD8(+) T cells, Treg cells, myeloid DC and macrophage, particularly in BRCA and LUAD. There was no strong correlation between CD73 and TMB/MSI. In LUAD, CD73 expression correlated genes were mainly enrichment in positive regulation of cell proliferation, cell adhesion, positive regulation of kinase activity, cellular response to LPS. However, in UCEC, CD73 correlated genes were mainly associated with fatty acid omega-oxidation, protein localization to endoplasmic reticulum exit site, endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. CONCLUSION: CD73 could be used to predict the prognosis of patients with several cancers. The potential functional mechanism of CD73 involved in cancer progress may not only dependent on its immunomodulatory effects."
39624167,Topological embedding and directional feature importance in ensemble classifiers for multi-class classification.,"Cancer is the second leading cause of disease-related death worldwide, and machine learning-based identification of novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection and treatment of various cancers. A key challenge in applying machine learning to high-dimensional data is deriving important features in an interpretable manner to provide meaningful insights into the underlying biological mechanisms We developed a class-based directional feature importance (CLIFI) metric for decision tree methods and demonstrated its use for The Cancer Genome Atlas proteomics data. The CLIFI metric was incorporated into four algorithms, Random Forest (RF), LAtent VAriable Stochastic Ensemble of Trees (LAVASET), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), and a new extension incorporating the LAVA step into GBDTs (LAVABOOST). Both LAVA methods incorporate topological information from protein interactions into the decision function. The different models' performance in classifying 28 cancers resulted in F1-scores of 92.6% (RF), 92.0% (LAVASET), 89.3% (LAVABOOST) and 85.7% (GBDT), with no method outperforming all others for individual cancer type prediction. The CLIFI metric enables visualisation of the model's decision-making functions. The resulting CLIFI value distributions indicated heterogeneity in the expression of several proteins (MYH11, ERalpha, BCL2) across different cancer types (including brain glioma, breast, kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer) aligning with the original raw expression data. In conclusion, we have developed an integrated, directional feature importance metric for multi-class decision tree-based classification models that facilitates interpretable feature importance assessment. The CLIFI metric can be combined with incorporating topological information into the decision functions of models to introduce inductive bias, enhancing interpretability."
39623081,Blood-based tumor mutational burden impacts clinical outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor treated breast and prostate cancers.,"BACKGROUND: Breast and prostate tumors are known to be less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tissue-based tumor mutation burden (tTMB) has emerged as a predictive biomarker of response to ICIs, including in these ""cold tumors"". In clinical practice, when tTMB is not available, blood-based TMB score (bTMB) can be used to consider treatment with ICIs. METHODS: This retrospective, real-world study included a final cohort of metastatic breast and prostate cancer patients treated with an ICI following a liquid biopsy test. Multiple bTMB-High cut-offs were assessed. Clinical, genomic, and outcomes data were collected. We hypothesized that a cut-off of bTMB >/=10 mut/Mb is not a strong predictor of response to ICIs in this setting. The Guardant Health genomic database (GHGD) was then queried (N = 13,992) for associations of bTMB with genomic alterations. RESULTS: In the clinical cohort (N = 48), ICI treatment is offered after a median of 3 (1-9) lines of treatment. The median bTMB is 16.4 (10-186) mut/Mb. The median time on ICI and PFS is 2.1 (0-1.7) and 3.1 months (95%CI, 1.6-4.6) respectively; no difference by MSI/MMR status (p = 0.152). Response rate among eligible patients (n = 36) is 16.7%; only N = 1/6 in bTMB <16 mut/Mb. High bMSI is associated with higher bTMB (correlation test, r = 0.66, p = 0.000). In the GHGD, patients with bTMB high have significantly more alterations than bTMB low and TP53, PIK3CA, ATM, ESR1, NF1, BRCA2, ARID1A, and APC were the most frequently altered genes. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the practice of offering an ICIs based on bTMB was uncommon and did not independently predict ICI benefits in patients with refractory, advanced breast and prostate cancers."
39623053,Intratumoral heterogeneity drives acquired therapy resistance in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer.,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is not curable due to its ability to acquire therapy resistance. Theoretically, acquired therapy resistance can be driven by changes to previously sensitive cancer cells or their environment and/or by outgrowth of a subpopulation of cancer cells with primary resistance. Direct demonstration of the latter mechanism in patients with PCa is lacking. Here we present a case report as proof-of-principle that outgrowth of a subpopulation of cancer cells lacking the genomic target and present prior to therapy initiation can drive acquired resistance to targeted therapy and threaten survival in patients with PCa."

39616467,Implementing evidence-based strategies for men with biochemically recurrent and advanced prostate cancer: Consensus recommendations from the US Prostate Cancer Conference 2024.,"Current US clinical practice guidelines for advanced prostate cancer management contain recommendations based on high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials; however, these guidelines do not address the nuanced clinical questions that are unanswered by prospective trials but nonetheless encountered in day-to-day practice. To address these practical questions, the 2024 US Prostate Cancer Conference (USPCC 2024) was created to generate US-focused expert clinical decision-making guidance for circumstances in which level 1 evidence is lacking. At the second annual USPCC meeting (USPCC 2024), a multidisciplinary panel of experts convened to discuss ongoing clinical challenges related to 5 topic areas: biochemical recurrence; metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer; poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitors; prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy; and metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Through a modified Delphi process, 34 consensus recommendations were developed and are intended to provide clinicians who manage prostate cancer with guidance related to the implementation of novel treatments and technologies. In this report, the authors review the areas of consensus identified by the USPCC 2024 experts and evaluate ongoing unmet needs regarding translational application of the current clinical evidence."
39616372,Association of radiomic features with genomic signatures in thyroid cancer: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest on the association of radiomic features with genomic signatures in oncology. Using computational methods, quantitative radiomic data are extracted from various imaging techniques and integrated with genomic information to construct predictive models aimed at advancing diagnostic strategies in cancer patient management. In this context, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the current knowledge on potential application of this association in patients with thyroid cancer (TC). METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted by querying three different databases (PubMed, Scopus and Embase) to identify studies published until June 2024, focusing on the potential association of radiomics and genomics in patients with TC. Pertinent data were subsequently extracted, and the methodological quality was evaluated using the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). RESULTS: From the initial analysis, a total of 853 papers were identified. After removing duplicates and applying eligibility criteria, we ultimately evaluated 7 articles. It was observed that the most commonly utilized imaging technique for TC examination was ultrasound (US), followed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Regarding genomic techniques, sequencing and polymerase chain reaction were the most commonly employed methods to validate genetic alterations. The association of radiomic features with genomic signatures demonstrated promising performance in predicting metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes or RET/PTC rearrangements. The effectiveness of models based on US-radiomic features in predicting BRAF(V600E) mutation in patients with TC requires further investigation. CONCLUSION: Although this systematic review has several limitations, primarily related to the limited amount of available literature data, the association of radiomic features with genomic signatures demonstrates a potential as non-invasive tool to enhance the accuracy and efficacy of TC diagnosis and prognosis. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024572292."
39614194,Causal roles of dietary structure and types on prostate cancer risk: A mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous observational studies have reported a strong link between dietary habits and the risk of prostate cancer. However, these studies are susceptible to confounding factors. To address this question, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the causal relationship between dietary habits and prostate cancer. METHODS: Genetic data for 25 different diet types were obtained from UK Biobank. Summary-level data on dietary composition and prostate cancer were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS). We employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW) for the primary analysis to examine the causal relationship between dietary components, dietary types, and prostate cancer. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using the Steiger filter, MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q statistic, funnel plot, and leave-one-out analysis were used for sensitivity analysis to ensure the robustness of our findings. RESULT: IVW results showed that relative fat intake (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.33-1.00, P < 0.05) and canned tomato intake (OR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.60 ~ 0.87, P < 0.01) and green bean intake (OR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.74 ~ 0.98, P = 0.03) may be protective factors for prostate cancer. In contrast, relative sugar intake (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.03-2.00, P = 0.03) may increase the risk of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Relative fat intake, green bean intake, and canned tomato intake may have a protective causal effect against prostate cancer, while relative sugar intake may increase the risk of prostate cancer. R These insights have implications for developing prevention strategies and interventions targeting dietary intake to prevent prostate cancer."
39614058,The Use of APC/C Antagonists to Promote Mitotic Catastrophe in Cancer Cells.,"The multiprotein subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) plays a key role in the control of mitosis progression. APC/C is the ultimate effector of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), the signaling system of higher organisms including the human that monitors the proper attachment of chromosomes to microtubules during cell division. Defects in this process result in genome instability, aneuploidy, premature aging, and cancer. APC/C roles in the SAC require its activation by the protein Cdc20. Interfering with APC/C activation by Cdc20 impairs APC/C substrate recognition, resulting in a delayed mitotic exit and eventually inducing cell death. This may be advantageous for the treatment of cancer and malignancies associated with SAC dysregulation. Here we describe a protocol to interfere with mitotic exit through the use of commercially available (Apcin, proTAME) as well as innovative small molecules we have developed that function as antagonists of APC/C activation by Cdc20. We show that the use of these molecules alone and in combination is effective to promote mitotic catastrophe and suppress cell expansion in 2D and 3D (spheroids) cancer cells of different tissue origin, including breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer."
39613933,Integrative analysis identifies the atypical repressor E2F8 as a targetable transcriptional activator driving lethal prostate cancer.,"Acquired resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies underscores the need to identify alternative therapeutic targets for treating lethal prostate cancer. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of 1635 human transcription factors (TFs) by analyzing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) datasets from the West and East Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) cohorts. Through this screening approach, we identified E2F8, a putative transcriptional repressor, as a TF consistently associated with poorer patient outcomes in both cohorts. Notably, E2F8 is highly expressed and active in AR-negative CRPC compared to AR-positive CRPC. Integrative profiling of E2F8 cistromes and transcriptomes in AR-negative CRPC cells revealed that E2F8 directly and non-canonically activates target oncogenes involved in cancer-associated pathways. To target E2F8 in CRPC, we employed the CRISPR/CasRx system to knockdown E2F8 mRNA, resulting in effective and specific downregulation of E2F8 and its target oncogenes, as well as significant growth inhibition in AR-negative CRPC in both cultured cells and xenograft models. Our findings identify and characterize E2F8 as a targetable transcriptional activator driving CRPC, particularly the growth of AR-negative CRPC."
39613543,Spatial Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize the Nature of Peripheral- Versus Transition-zone Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PC) in the transition zone (TZ) has better prognosis than peripheral-zone (PZ) PC despite higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in patients with TZ tumors. Our aim was to characterize molecular differences between TZ and PZ tumors and their clinical implications. METHODS: We performed spatial whole-transcriptome analyses of 50 regions of interest (ROIs) from three patients with PZ and/or TZ PC. ROIs were selected on the basis of SYTO13, pan-cytokeratin, smooth muscle actin, and CD45 markers. Downstream analyses of the transcriptomics data included differential gene expression and Molecular Signatures Database cancer hallmark analysis for pathway enrichment. Survival analyses were performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate data set. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: We analyzed Gleason grade 4 (10 ROIs) and grade 5 (10 ROIs) tumors from the PZ, and grade 3 (10 ROIs), grade 4 (11 ROIs), and grade 5 (1 ROI) tumors from the TZ. We observed distinct gene expression profiles between PZ (n = 20) and TZ (n = 22) tumors. TZ ROIs exhibited enrichment of androgen response signaling (ARS; false discovery rate <5%) and a higher androgen subscore of the genomic prostate score (p < 0.001), regardless of grade and the epithelial, stromal, or immune component of the region. Genes underexpressed in PZ tumors, including ARS genes, were associated with poorer progression-free survival in the TCGA data set (n = 451; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate higher ARS in TZ tumors than in PZ tumors, explaining the higher PSA and better prognosis for TZ tumors. Further studies are needed to integrate zonal location in diagnostic and treatment algorithms for PC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at the biological explanation for higher PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels in blood for cancers found in different zones of the prostate. We found that genes involved in androgen response signaling may explain the higher PSA often seen for tumors in the transition zone than for tumors in the peripheral zone of the prostate. These findings may inform how we diagnose and treat prostate cancer."
39609498,Epidemiologic study on prostate cancer in Sudanese men across African ethnic groups.,"This study sought to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of Sudanese men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) to highlight differences in diagnosis among the three major ethnolinguistic groups. A total of 532 patients with confirmed PCa diagnosis through biopsy were enrolled from six medical centers in Sudan. The majority of patients, comprising 84.2% (448/532), were diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, with a Grade group above 3. There were no discernible differences in PCa aggressiveness among the ethnolinguistic groups. However, higher levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were observed in the Niger-Congo group, where 55.2% had PSA values exceeding 50 ng/ml. Patients from this group were also diagnosed at a younger age. In contrast, 90.5% of Afro-Asiatic patients are over 60 years old. Further analysis conducted within an age-matched subgroup of patients (n = 273) revealed a higher incidence of perineural invasion in the Afro-Asiatic group. This research represents the first investigation of PCa across different African ethnic groups and associates a higher incidence of perineural invasion with a specific ethnic group. While recent efforts have been made to establish African-relevant risk models to mitigate PCa health disparities, there remains a need for further investigation into genetically distinct populations within the African continent."
39609420,C/EBPbeta-dependent autophagy inhibition hinders NK cell function in cancer.,"NK cells are endowed with tumor killing ability, nevertheless most cancers impair NK cell functionality, and cell-based therapies have limited efficacy in solid tumors. How cancers render NK cell dysfunctional is unclear, and overcoming resistance is an important immune-therapeutic aim. Here, we identify autophagy as a central regulator of NK cell anti-tumor function. Analysis of differentially expressed genes in tumor-infiltrating versus non-tumor NK cells from our previously published scRNA-seq data of advanced human prostate cancer shows deregulation of the autophagic pathway in tumor-infiltrating NK cells. We confirm this by flow cytometry in patients and in diverse cancer models in mice. We further demonstrate that exposure of NK cells to cancer deregulates the autophagic process, decreases mitochondrial polarization and impairs effector functions. Mechanistically, CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), downstream of CXCL12-CXCR4 interaction, acts as regulator of NK cell metabolism. Accordingly, inhibition of CXCR4 and C/EBPbeta restores NK cell fitness. Finally, genetic and pharmacological activation of autophagy improves NK cell effector and cytotoxic functions, which enables tumour control by NK and CAR-NK cells. In conclusion, our study identifies autophagy as an intracellular checkpoint in NK cells and introduces autophagy regulation as an approach to strengthen NK-cell-based immunotherapies."
39607104,"Antarctic bryophyte Sanionia uncinata (HEDW.) Loeske, Amblystegiaceae, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and acetylcholinesterase activities.","Sanionia uncinata, or Sickle-leaved-Hook-moss, is a cosmopolitan pleurocarpous moss composing the Antarctic Peninsulae biodiversity, primordially forming dense mats over rocks. The species was collected in 24 different spots located at King George Island and was processed to obtain 24 ethanolic extracts (ADS#) by a serial-24h-maceration, which were prospected for antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antioxidant, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activities by using in vitro tests. Alien material was removed from the non-sterilized plant samples before being submitted for extraction. It was observed that extracts collected in different spots showed different biological activities. Extracts ADS04(10.66+/-0,17mm) and ADS14(11.37+/-0,11mm) were active against Staphylococcus aureus, according to the diffusion in bioautography assay. They showed significant antioxidant activity and inhibited AChE; the cytotoxicity observed to the human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were higher than in normal cell line MCF-10A. ADS04 was 7.62 times more cytotoxic to MCF-7, and ADS14 was 2.03 times more cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 than to MCF-10A. The extracts showed similar cytotoxicity between PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, and MCF-10A. Sanionia uncinata extracts are a vital potential source of biologically active compounds, particularly ADS04 and ADS14, including further prospection on eventual bryophyte's endophytic fungi."
39606519,Study of HOXB13 Gene Variants in Prostate Cancer Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) is a prevalent malignancy with a significant hereditary component. The HOXB13 gene, encoding a transcription factor involved in prostate development, has been implicated in PC risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the existence of HOXB13 mutations in PC patients. METHOD: The retrospective study included 33 PC patients and 23 controls. Demographic data, family history, and smoking habits were recorded. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured. We investigated the second exon of HOXB13 after extracting genomic DNA from blood samples for mutations using polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. RESULT: PC patients had a higher mean age (64.7 years), more frequent positive family history (63.64%, N = 21), and higher smoking prevalence (60.61%, N = 20) compared to controls. PSA levels were significantly elevated in patients (76.58 ng/ml) versus controls (7.22 ng/ml). HOXB13 mutations, including thymine (3.03%, N = 1), guanine (27.27%, N = 9), and adenine (33.33%, N = 11) mutations, were observed in patients, while no mutations were found in controls. CONCLUSION: PC patients had higher mean age, more positive family histories, higher smoking rates, and elevated PSA levels. HOXB13 mutations were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. These findings emphasize the roles of HOXB13, age, family history, smoking, and PSA in PC risk stratification."
39606414,AI-Powered cellular morphometric biomarkers discovered in needle biopsy of prostatic cancer predict neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy response and prognosis: an international multicenter retrospective study.,"It is imperative to identify patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who will benefit from androgen receptor signaling inhibitors that can impact quality of life upon prolonged use. Using our extensively-validated artificial-intelligence technique: cellular morphometric biomarker via machine learning (CMB-ML), we identified 13 CMBs from whole slide images of needle biopsies from the trial specimens ( NCT02430480 , n=37) that accurately predicted response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) (AUC: 0.980). Notably, 13-CMB model stratified PCa patients into responder and non-responder groups after NADT treatment in an independent hospital cohort (n=122) that significantly associated with pathologic complete response (p=0.0005), biochemical-recurrence-free survival (p=0.024) and mTOR signaling pathway (p=0.03), suggesting potentially more clinical benefit from mTOR inhibitors in non-responder group. Additionally, genetic and genomic analysis revealed interplay between genetic variants and CMBs on NADT resistance, and provided molecular annotations for CMBs. Overall, prospective clinical implementation of 13-CMB model could assist precision care of PCa patients. SIGNIFICANCE: We describe a highly accurate CMB model to predict the therapeutic benefit in prostate cancer patients and uncover the complex interplay between genetic variants and CMBs on NADT resistance. Our model relies only on widely available needle biopsy specimens and provides a robust and cost-effective solution for clinical implementation."
39606387,Non-coding genetic variants underlying higher prostate cancer risk in men of African ancestry.,"Incidence and severity of prostate cancer (PrCa) substantially varies across ancestries. American men of African ancestry (AA) are more likely to be diagnosed with and die from PrCa than the those of European ancestry (EA). Published polygenic risk scores for developing prostate cancer, even those based on multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies, do not address population-specific genetic mechanisms underlying PrCa risk in men of African ancestry. Specifically, the role of non-coding regulatory polymorphisms in driving inter-ancestry variation in PrCa has not been sufficiently explored. Here, by employing a sequence-based deep learning model of prostate regulatory enhancers, we identified ~2,000 SNPs with higher alternate allele frequency in AA men that potentially affect enhancer function associated with PrCa susceptibility, as supported by our experimental validation. The identified enhancer SNPs (eSNPs) may influence PrCa development through two complementary mechanisms: 1) the alternate allele that increase enhancer activity result in immune suppression and telomere elongation, and 2) the alternate alleles that decrease enhancer activity, lead to de-differentiation and inhibition of apoptosis. Notably, the eSNPs tend to disrupt the binding of known prostate transcription factors including FOX, AR and HOX families. Lastly, the identified eSNPs can be combined into a polygenic risk score that adds value to current GWAS-based risk variants in assessing PrCa risk in independent cohorts."
39605806,The 14-bp insertion/deletion as a promising gene polymorphism to understand cancer risk: Evidence from a systematic review and comprehensive meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: HLA-G is associated with cancer cell escape. The 3'UTR polymorphism is involved in the regulation of membrane-bound HLA-G and soluble HLA-G proteins. The aim of our study was to assess the association of the HLA-G 14-bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism with cancer susceptibility and its interaction with clinicopathological features and environmental factors. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism and different types of cancers according to the Prisma guidelines. RESULTS: Thirty-nine publications that studied the 14-bp I/D polymorphism in cancers met our inclusion criteria. The findings of the meta-analysis showed a significant association between the 14-bp I/D polymorphism and cancer risk under the allelic contrast model D vs. I (OR = 1,112, 95 % CI = 1,009-1,227; P = 0,033) suggesting that the D allele was a risk factor for cancer susceptibility. Stratification by cancer type demonstrated a significant association of the 14-bp I/D polymorphism with breast cancer under the D vs. I contrast allele model (OR = 1,267, 95 % CI = 1,028-1,563; P = 0,027). No significant association was found for digestive, cervical, haematological and thyroid cancers. A comparison of groups stratified by ethnicity showed a significant association for Caucasians under the D vs. I model (OR = 1,147, 95 % CI = 1,002-1,313; P = 0,047); and for mixed ethnicities under the DD + DI vs. II (OR = 1,388, 95 % CI = 1,083-1,780; P = 0,010) and DI vs. II (OR = 1,402, 95 % CI = 1,077-1,824; P = 0,012) models. A comparison of cancer risks associated with the 14-bp I/D polymorphism according to geographic location revealed significant risks for the D allele and DD genotype in North Africa, the Middle East and South America. However, no significant susceptibility to cancer associated with the 14-bp I/D polymorphism was shown for Europe and North Asia. The findings of a meta-analysis of subgroups by disease stage showed a significant association in both early and advanced stages, with the 14-bp deletion variant being a risk factor. Similarly, a significant cancer risk was shown for the 14-bp deletion variant in both low- and high-grade cancers. Finally, the risk associated with the 14-bp I/D polymorphism was higher in cancers with concomitant viral infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). CONCLUSION: The findings of the overall meta-analysis showed a significant association between the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. The findings stratified analysis and subgroup comparisons showed that the 14-bp I/D deletion variant was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism may interact with individual and clinicopathological factors to alter cancer risk. These promising findings for cancer risk provide the basis for further studies that explore 14bp I/D polymorphism in cancer screening and immunotherapeutic approach."
39605429,Pan-Cancer Drug Sensitivity Prediction from Gene Expression using Deep Learning.,"Cancer is a group of complex diseases, with tumor heterogeneity, durable drug efficacy, emerging resistance, and host toxicity presenting major challenges to the development of effective cancer therapeutics. While traditionally used methods have remained limited in their capacity to overcome these challenges in cancer drug development, efforts have been made in recent years toward applying ""big data"" to cancer research and precision oncology. By curating, standardizing, and integrating data from various databases, we developed deep learning architectures that use perturbation and baseline transcriptional signatures to predict efficacious small molecule compounds and genetic dependencies in cancer. A series of internal validations followed by prospective validation in prostate cancer cell lines were performed to ensure consistent performance and model applicability. We report SensitivitySeq, a novel bioinformatics tool for prioritizing small molecule compounds and gene dependencies in silico to drive the development of targeted therapies for cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised deep learning approach, validated in vitro, to predict drug sensitivity using baseline cancer cell line gene expression alongside cell line-independent perturbation-response consensus signatures."
39603876,Genetic variations related to the prostate cancer risk: A field synopsis and revaluation by Bayesian approaches of genome-wide association studies.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disease influenced by many factors, with the genetic contribution for this neoplasia having a great role in its risk. The literature brings an increased number of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS's) that attempt to elucidate the genetic associations with PCa. However, these genome studies have a considerable rate of false-positive data whose results may be biased. Therefore, we aimed to apply Bayesian approaches on significant associations among polymorphisms and PCa from GWAS's data. A literature search was performed for data published before April 20, 2024, whereby two investigators used a specific combination of keywords and Boolean operators in the search (""prostate carcinoma or prostate cancer or PCa"" and ""polymorphism or genetic variation"" and ""Genome-Wide Association Study or GWAS""). The records were retrieved, and the data were extracted with further application of two different Bayesian approaches: The False Positive Report Probability (FPRP) and the Bayesian False-Discovery Probability (BFDP), both at the prior probabilities of 10(-3) and 10(-6). The data were considered as noteworthy at the level of FPRP <0.2 and BFDP <0.8. Besides, in-silico analyses by gene-gene network and gene enrichment were performed to evaluate the role of the noteworthy genes in PCa. As results, 13 GWAS's were included, with 2,520 values for FPRP and 1,368 values for BFDP being obtained. Our study showed an extensive number of gene variations as noteworthy candidate biomarkers for PCa risk, with highlighting for those occurred in the 8q24 locus and in the MSMB, ITGA6, SUN2, FGF10, INCENP, MLPH, and KLK3 genes."
39602114,Polygenic Score for Clinicopathologic Features and Survival Outcomes in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.,"IMPORTANCE: Genome-wide association studies have identified germline variants associated with the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) that can be used to construct a polygenic score (PGS). It is important to determine whether patients with higher germline genetic risk, as summarized using PGS, present with more aggressive disease and/or develop worse clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether germline risk defined by PGS is associated with clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes for patients with PTC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with newly diagnosed PTC who presented to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for treatment between 1999 and 2014, with a median follow-up of 12 years. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to April 2024. EXPOSURE: Germline risk, as defined by PGS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy coat cells isolated from peripheral blood samples, and genotyping for germline polymorphisms was performed. Germline risk for PTC was estimated with a previously validated PGS calculated from 10 single-nucleotide variations identified through genome-wide association studies. Stage; PTC-specific survival, defined as the time from PTC diagnosis to death caused by PTC; and overall survival, defined as the time from PTC diagnosis to death by any cause, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were included in the study (261 women [71.3%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 44.3 [13.8] years). There was a statistically significant association between higher PGS and multifocality (beta [SE], 0.40 [0.23]; P = .045) and cervical lymph node involvement (N stage) (beta [SE], 0.62 [0.35]; P = .009) at diagnosis. PGS was associated with PTC-specific survival (hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.03-6.85; P = .04), but this association was not independent of age and overall stage. There was not a statistically significant association between PGS and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this cohort study suggest that patients with a higher germline risk of PTC, as estimated by PGS, present with more aggressive clinicopathologic features. These results contribute to the current understanding of inherited risk in PTC and how germline variants could potentially contribute to disease presentation and clinical outcomes."
39601418,Structures of Trichomonas vaginalis macrophage migratory inhibitory factor.,"The unicellular parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis causes trichomoniasis, the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted disease globally. T. vaginalis evades host immune responses by producing homologs of host proteins, including cytokines such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor. T. vaginalis macrophage migration inhibitory factor (TvMIF) helps to facilitate the survival of T. vaginalis during nutritional stress conditions, increases prostate cell proliferation and invasiveness, and induces inflammation-related cellular pathways, thus mimicking the ability of human MIF to increase inflammation and cell proliferation. The production, crystallization and three structures of N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged TvMIF reveal a prototypical MIF trimer with a topology similar to that of human homologs (hMIF-1 and hMIF-2). The N-terminal tag obscures the expected pyruvate-binding site. The similarity of TvMIF to its human homologs can be exploited for structure-based drug discovery."
39600951,"Causal links of human serum metabolites on the risk of prostate cancer: insights from genome-wide Mendelian randomization, single-cell RNA sequencing, and metabolic pathway analysis.","BACKGROUND: Recently, serum metabolites have shown potential in predicting survival outcomes and may be related to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the precise impact concerning the genetic effect of metabolites on prostate cancer risk remains obscure. In this context, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study aiming to explore the causality between genetically determined metabolites and the risk of prostate cancer. METHODS: We conducted a two-sample MR analysis aiming to identify the underlying metabolites associated with prostate cancer. Exposure information was obtained from the largest metabolome-based genome-wide association (GWAS) data containing 7,824 Europeans. Genome-wide association analysis was utilized to detect instrumental variables (IVs) for metabolites. We applied the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach as the primary method, and to augment the reliability and robustness of our findings, additional analysis methods encompassing weighted median, MR-Egger, and leave-one-out analysis were utilized. MR-Egger intercept test was implemented to explore the pleiotropy. Cochran's Q test was utilized to quantify the degree of heterogeneity. Additionally, we performed metabolic pathway analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. RESULTS: We found that three serum metabolites were causally associated with prostate cancer after utilizing rigorous screening standards. Utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms as IVs, a 1-SD increase in fructose was associated with 77% higher risk of prostate cancer (OR:1.77, 95%CI: 1.05-2.97, P(IVW)=0.031), a 1-SD increase in N1-methyl-3-pyridone-4-carboxamide was associated with 29% higher risk of prostate cancer (OR:1.29, 95%CI: 1.05-1.58, P(IVW)=0.017), and a 1-SD increase in 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (12-HETE) was associated with 18% higher risk of prostate cancer (OR:1.18, 95%CI: 1.07-1.31, P(IVW)=0.0008). Metabolites that were causally linked to the risk of prostate cancer were mainly enriched in the valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway (P=0.026) and the nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathway (P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analysis provided suggestive evidence supporting the causal relationships between three identified serum metabolites and prostate cancer, necessitating further investigation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which these blood metabolites and metabolic pathways may impact the initiation and progression of prostate cancer."
39600743,Exploring Ethnic Variability in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling: Delineating Differences in Prostate Cancer Outcomes Between African American and Caucasian Populations.,"Prostate cancer rates and outcomes show significant differences between African American (AA) and Caucasian men, with AA males experiencing higher incidence and mortality rates. These disparities result from a complex interaction of socioeconomic, environmental, and biological factors. This study explores how the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) and Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling pathways contribute to these differences. AHR, traditionally recognized for its role in detoxifying environmental carcinogens, has recently been identified as playing a key role in prostate cancer progression. AA men tend to exhibit higher levels of AHR expression and activity, which may contribute to the aggressive nature of the disease in this population. The interaction between AHR and AR signaling pathways might promote tumor growth and lead to resistance to standard treatments. Additionally, genetic variations in the AHR and AR genes, along with environmental exposures, may exacerbate these disparities. This study emphasizes the importance of developing targeted therapies that address the specific genetic and molecular profiles of different populations. By gaining a deeper understanding of the roles of AHR and AR signaling in prostate cancer, particularly in the context of ethnic diversity, we aim to work toward reducing these disparities and improving outcomes for all patients."
39599840,Genome-Wide Analysis of p53 Targets Reveals SCN2A as a Novel Player in p53-Induced Cell Arrest in HPV-Positive Cells.,"The host transcription factor p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in HPV-induced carcinogenesis, regulating target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the p53 targets have not been thoroughly analyzed in HPV-infected cells. In this study, p53 signaling in HPV16 and HPV18 cells was activated by depleting the viral oncoprotein E6. Subsequently, p53-regulated genes were identified by comparing them with genes altered in p53-silenced cells. True p53 targets were defined as genes with at least one overlapping p53 binding site and ChIP peak near their locus. Our analysis revealed that while some p53 targets were common to both the HPV16 and HPV18 cells, the majority of the targets differed between these two types, potentially contributing to the varying prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical cancer. Additionally, we identified SCN2A as a novel p53 target involved in p53-induced cell cycle arrest in HPV-related carcinogenesis. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which p53 inhibits HPV-induced carcinogenesis."
39596257,CAGn Polymorphic Locus of Androgen Receptor (AR) Gene in Russian Infertile and Fertile Men.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is critical for mediating the effects of androgens. The polymorphic CAGn locus in exon 1 of the AR gene is associated with several diseases, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), prostate cancer, and male infertility. This study evaluated the CAGn locus in 9000 infertile Russian men and 286 fertile men (control group). The CAGn locus was analyzed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism method. In the infertile cohort, the number of CAG repeats ranged from 6 to 46, with a unimodal distribution. The number of CAG repeats in infertile and fertile men was 22.15 +/- 0.93 and 22.02 +/- 1.36, respectively. In infertile men, variants with 16 to 29 repeats were present in 97% of the alleles. A complete mutation (>/=42 CAG repeats) was found in three patients, while three others had 39-41 repeats. The incidence of SBMA was 1:3000 infertile men. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between infertile and fertile men in alleles with 21, 24 and 25 repeats. This study revealed certain differences in the CAGn polymorphic locus of the AR gene in Russian infertile and fertile men and determined the frequency of SBMA in infertile patients."
39595976,Discovery of RNA Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Using Cross-Platform Transcriptomics.,"Microarray and Single-Molecule Molecular Inversion Probe (smMIP)-based targeted RNA sequencing are two RNA profiling platforms for identifying disease-associated biomarkers. The microarray uses a GeneChip array with oligonucleotide probes to measure expression levels across thousands of genes, while smMIPs capture and quantify RNA transcripts and transcript variants via next-generation sequencing. To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both platforms, a comparative gene expression profiling study was conducted using RNA samples from 52 prostate tissues (normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and various prostate cancer (PCa) grades). Of all genes covered by both platforms, only 35% of the expression levels aligned, with 45% showing discrepancies. Both platforms identified the same 17 genes as potential PCa biomarkers. Microarray analysis identified an additional 253 genes that were not covered or not identified by smMIP technology, while smMIP technology identified eight markers not covered or not identified in the microarray core gene analysis, including fusion genes and splice variants. For high-grade prostate cancer (HG-PCa), the smMIP-method identified 8 markers, and the microarray identified 17 markers, with FOLH1, FAP and CLDN3 being common across both platforms. The choice of RNA expression analysis technology depends on research objectives; microarray technology is useful for the evaluation of a wide range of genes but has low throughput. In contrast, smMIP-based RNA sequencing enables sensitive analysis with minimal RNA in a medium- to high-throughput setting."
39595158,A Systematic Identification of RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) Driving Aberrant Splicing in Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Alternative Splicing (AS) is a post-transcriptional process that allows a single RNA to produce different mRNA variants and, in some cases, multiple proteins. Various processes, many yet to be discovered, regulate AS. This study focuses on regulation by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which are not only crucial for splicing regulation but also linked to cancer prognosis and are emerging as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. CLIP-seq experiments help identify where RBPs bind on nascent transcripts, potentially revealing changes in splicing status that suggest causal relationships. Selecting specific RBPs for CLIP-seq experiments is often driven by a priori hypotheses. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm to detect RBPs likely related to splicing changes between conditions by integrating several CLIP-seq databases and a differential splicing detection algorithm. This work refines a previous study by improving splicing event prediction, testing different enrichment statistics, and performing additional validation experiments. The new method provides more accurate predictions and is included in the Bioconductor package EventPointer 3.14. We tested the algorithm in four experiments involving knockdowns of seven different RBPs. The algorithm accurately assessed the statistical significance of these RBPs using only splicing alterations. Additionally, we applied the algorithm to study sixteen cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and three from TARGET. We identified relationships between RBPs and various cancer types, including alterations in CREBBP and MBNL2 in adenocarcinomas of the lung, liver, prostate, rectum, stomach, and colon. Some of these findings are validated in the literature, while others are novel. CONCLUSIONS: The developed algorithm enhances the ability to predict and understand RBP-related splicing changes, offering more accurate predictions and novel insights into cancer-related splicing alterations. This work highlights the potential of RBPs as therapeutic targets and contributes to the broader understanding of their roles in cancer biology."
39594721,Relationship Between Loss of Y Chromosome and Urologic Cancers: New Future Perspectives.,"Background: The Y chromosome (ChrY) is essential for male sex determination and spermatogenesis. However, recent studies have revealed its broader role in various physiological processes and disease susceptibility, including cancer. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases like MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The review included clinical and preclinical studies in animals and humans focusing on the role of LoY in urological tumors. Data on the frequency of LoY, its clinical implications, and underlying mechanisms were extracted and analyzed. Results: The evidence suggests that LoY is associated with an increased risk of urologic neoplasms, potentially serving as an early marker of genomic instability. Studies reveal that LoY in urologic cancers correlates with worse survival outcomes and may contribute to tumor progression. LoY may interfere with chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation, suggesting its role as a contributor to early tumorigenesis. Conclusions: LoY appears to be a structural aberration with unique biological and clinical relevance in urologic cancers, possibly serving as a biomarker for genomic instability. Further research is necessary to identify specific Y-linked genes affected by LoY, potentially informing targeted therapies and early diagnostic strategies for these cancers."
39594547,Glutathione Peroxidases: An Emerging and Promising Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer Treatment.,"Glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) are a family of enzymes that play a critical role in cellular redox homeostasis through the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to alcohols, using glutathione as a substrate. Among them, GPx4 is particularly of interest in the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid peroxides in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. Ferroptosis has emerged as a crucial pathway in the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, which is notoriously resistant to conventional therapies. GPx4 acts as a key inhibitor of ferroptosis by detoxifying lipid peroxides, thereby preventing cell death. However, this protective mechanism also enables cancer cells to survive under oxidative stress, which makes GPx4 a potential druggable target in cancer therapy. The inhibition of GPx4 can trigger ferroptosis selectively in cancer cells, especially in those that rely heavily on this pathway for survival, such as pancreatic cancer cells. Consequently, targeting GPx4 and other GPX family members offers a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to ferroptosis, potentially overcoming resistance to current treatments and improving patient outcomes. Current research is focusing on the development of small-molecule inhibitors of GPx4 as potential candidates for pancreatic cancer treatment."
39594482,Characterization of the Peroxisomal Proteome and Redox Balance in Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with disruptions in cellular redox balance. Given the intricate role of peroxisomes in redox metabolism, we conducted comprehensive proteomics analyses to compare peroxisomal and redox protein profiles between benign (RWPE-1) and malignant (22Rv1, LNCaP, and PC3) prostate cell lines. Our analyses revealed significant enrichment of the ""peroxisome"" pathway among proteins notably upregulated in androgen receptor (AR)-positive cell lines. In addition, catalase (CAT) activity was consistently higher in these malignant cell lines compared to RWPE-1, which contrasts with previous studies reporting lower CAT levels and increased H(2)O(2) levels in PCa tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. To mimic this clinical scenario, we used RNA interference to knock down CAT expression. Our results show that reduced CAT levels enhanced 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell proliferation. R1881-induced activation of AR, a key driver of PCa, increased expression of the H(2)O(2)-producing peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and 3, reduced CAT expression and activity, and elevated peroxisomal H(2)O(2) levels. Considering these changes and other antioxidant enzyme profile alterations, we propose that enhanced AR activity in PCa reduces CAT function, leading to increased peroxisomal H(2)O(2) levels that trigger adaptive stress responses to promote cell survival, growth, and proliferation."
39592997,METTL2B m3C RNA transferase: oncogenic role in ovarian cancer progression via regulation of the mTOR/AKT pathway and its link to the tumor immune microenvironment.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of N3-methylcytidine methyltransferase 2B (METTL2B) has been observed in various human malignancies, including those of the prostate, liver, breasts, and bladder. However, its role in ovarian cancer (OC) remains largely unexplored. This research preliminarily investigated METTL2B expression in OC and elucidated the associated molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We utilized three publicly available cancer-related databases (Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Expression Omnibus, and The Cancer Genome Atlas) to identify gene signatures in patients with OC and normal individuals with a specific focus on METTL2B. The role of METTL2B in OC was evaluated using patient survival data, and its impact on oncogenic behaviors in both cell and animal models, including growth potential, migration, invasion, and the tumor microenvironment, was examined. This assessment was conducted using bioinformatics tools such as Gene Set Cancer Analysis, GeneMANIA, and Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub 2. Additionally, the association between drug sensitivity and METTL2B expression was analyzed using CellMiner. RESULTS: METTL2B expression was significantly elevated in OC, highlighting its potential clinical value in the diagnosis and prognosis of OC. Patients with lower METTL2B expression exhibited favorable survival. Furthermore, METTL2B knockdown significantly disrupted oncogenic behaviors in OC cell lines by suppressing the mTOR/AKT signaling pathway. Additionally, bioinformatics-based Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses suggested a close correlation between METTL2B and immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our research confirmed the upregulation of METTL2B in OC, suggesting its oncogenic function. However, METTL2B expression was negatively correlated with the infiltration scores of multiple immune cells, including cytotoxic cells and T cells, indicating its complex role in the tumor immune microenvironment. These findings highlight the significant clinical value of METTL2B in the diagnosis and prognosis of OC."
39590378,miR-5100 Overexpression Inhibits Prostate Cancer Progression by Inducing Cell Cycle Arrest and Targeting E2F7.,"Despite advances in treatment, prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulatory molecules in cancer biology. In this research, we investigated the tumor-suppressive role of miR-5100 in PCa and its underlying molecular mechanism. By using RT-qPCR, we observed lower miR-5100 expression in PCa cell lines than in benign prostate cells. Functional assays demonstrated that miR-5100 overexpression significantly suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. By using RNA-sequencing, we identified 446 down-regulated and 806 upregulated candidate miR-5100 target genes overrepresenting cell cycle terms. Mechanistically, E2F7 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-5100 using the reporter gene assay and RIP assay. By conducting flow cytometry analysis, cell cycle progression was blocked at the S phase. E2F7 overexpression partially mitigated the suppressive impact of miR-5100 in PCa cells. In conclusion, miR-5100 is a tumor suppressor in PCa by blocking cell cycle and targeting E2F7."
39588827,Identification of co-localised transcription factors based on paired motifs analysis.,"The interaction of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA precisely regulates gene transcription. In mammalian cells, thousands of TFs often interact with DNA cis-regulatory elements in a combinatorial manner rather than act alone. The identification of cooperativity between TFs can help to explore the mechanism of transcriptional regulation. However, little is known about the cooperative patterns of TFs in the genome. To identify which TFs prefer co-localisation, the authors conducted a paired motif analysis in the accessible regions of the human genome based on the Poisson background model. Especially, the authors distinguish the cooperative binding TFs and the competitive binding TFs according to the distance between TF motifs. In the K562 cell line, the authors find that TFs from a same family are always competing the same binding sites, such as FOS_JUN family, whereas KLF family TFs show significant cooperative binding in the adjacency region. Furthermore, the comparative analysis across 16 human cell lines indicates that most TF combination patterns are conserved, but there are still some cell-line-specific patterns. Finally, in human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and human prostate normal cells (RWPE-2), the authors investigate the specific TF combination patterns in the disease cell and normal cell. The results show that the cooperative binding TF pairs shared by PC-3 and RWPE-2 account for over 90%. Simultaneously, the authors also identify 26 specific TF combination pairs in PC-3 cancer cells."
39586885,TBP activates DCBLD1 transcription to promote cell cycle progression in cervical cancer.,"Discoidin, CUB, and LCCL domain-containing (DCBLD) proteins have been associated with poor prognosis of human cancers. This study investigated the function of DCBLD1 in the development of cervical cancer (CC) and explored its associated mechanism. DCBLD1 was identified as a dysregulated gene in CC via bioinformatics analysis. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR assays revealed increased DCBLD1 expression in CC specimens and cells. Artificial DCBLD1 knockdown blocked the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cells, while promoting cell apoptosis and inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Following bioinformatic predictions and subsequent chromatin-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays, TATA-box binding protein (TBP) was found to be a transcription factor that binds to the DCBLD1 promoter region for transcriptional activation. Knockdown of TBP similarly blocked the malignant properties of CC cells and induced cell cycle arrest, but these changes were reversed by further DCBLD1 overexpression. Xenograft mouse tumors were generated for in vivo validation. Consistently, the tumorigenic activity of CC cells in nude mice was suppressed by TBP knockdown, but restored by DCBLD1 overexpression. In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that TBP-mediated DCBLD1 activation is correlated with cell cycle and CC progression. TBP and DCBLD1 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for CC management."
39586489,Protein profile in urinary extracellular vesicles is a marker of malignancy and correlates with muscle invasiveness in urinary bladder cancer.,"Urinary Bladder Cancer (UBC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers worldwide, has a high recurrence rate and unpredictable treatment responses. Thus, biomarkers are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from both cancer- and immune cells and provide a snapshot of the originating cell. They are abundant in urine and are therefore candidate biomarkers for UBC. Isolated urinary EVs from 39 UBC patients were compared with EVs from healthy controls, prostate cancer patients and whole urine. Samples were from bladder urine at time of both transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURB) and cystectomy, as well as urine taken from the ureter at cystectomy. EVs were isolated by tangential flow filtration and differential ultracentrifugation and their protein composition was detected by Proximity Extension Assay (PEA; Olink, immuno-oncology panel). In UBC patients, the proteomic signature of bladder urine EVs differed from ureter urine EVs from the same individuals, and from bladder urine derived EVs of both healthy and prostate cancer controls. Pairwise comparison was performed with matched whole urine revealing proteins solely detected in isolated vesicles. Additionally, a distinct signature was identified in bladder urine EVs correlating with muscle invasiveness, and a trained classifier could predict UBC with 92 % accuracy. Some differentially expressed proteins, HO-1 and MMP7, were analysed by bead-based flow cytometry, where HO-1 was detected on the EV surface. Taken together, these results strengthen the rationale of using EVs as non-invasive biomarkers and prognostic tools for UBC."
39585897,GWAS and 3D chromatin mapping identifies multicancer risk genes associated with hormone-dependent cancers.,"Hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs) share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using data from genome-wide association studies, we showed spatial clustering of risk variants across four HDCs (breast, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancers), contrasting with genetically uncorrelated traits. We identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs: two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, we pinpointed lncRNAs as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factors motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDC. Our approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility."
39584005,Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 is a regulator of tumor growth and metastasis in double-negative prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men worldwide. With heavy androgen deprivation therapies, prostate cancer may shift to androgen receptor negative and neuroendocrine negative subtype of castration resistant prostate cancer, defined as double-negative prostate cancer. Double-negative prostate cancer is associated with poor prognosis and disease mortality. The molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of double-negative prostate cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), is negatively correlated with androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer patients. UCH-L1 plays a functional role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in double-negative prostate cancer. Knock-down of UCH-L1 decreases double-negative prostate cancer colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, decrease of UCH-L1 significantly delays cell migration in vitro and spontaneous metastasis and metastatic colonization in vivo. Proteomic analysis revealed that mTORC1 signaling, androgen response signaling and MYC targets are the top three decreased pathways upon UCH-L1 decrease. Further, treatment with LDN-57444, a UCH-L1 small molecule inhibitor, impairs double-negative prostate cancer cell colony formation, migration in vitro, and metastatic colonization in vivo. Our study reveals that UCH-L1 is an important regulator of double-negative prostate cancer tumor growth and progression, providing a promising therapeutic target for this subtype of metastatic prostate cancer."
39581665,French AFU Cancer Committee Guidelines - Update 2024-2026: Prostate cancer - Management of metastatic disease and castration resistance.,"PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT: The Oncology Committee of the French Urology Association is proposing updated recommendations for the management of recurrent and/or metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from 2022 to 2024 was conducted by the CCAFU on the therapeutic management of recurrent PCa following local or metastatic treatment, assessing the references based on their level of evidence. RESULTS: Molecular imaging is the standard approach for assessing recurrence after local treatment and should not delay early salvage treatment. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the primary treatment option for metastatic PCa. Intensification of ADT, now cononsidered standard care for metastatic PCa, involves incorporating at least one new-generation hormone therapy (ARPI). For patients with high-volume metastatic disease at diagnosis, adding docetaxel to ADT+ARPI may be considered for eligible patients. In castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) patients, poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and PSMA radioligand therapy are new treatment options. The combination and sequencing of treatmentsare influenced by several factors, including patient and disease characteristics, prior therapies, genomic status, and molecular imaging findings. CONCLUSION: This update of French recommendations should help to improve the management recurrent or metastatic PCa patients."
39578659,Polyploid cancer cells reveal signatures of chemotherapy resistance.,"Therapeutic resistance in cancer significantly contributes to mortality, with many patients eventually experiencing recurrence after initial treatment responses. Recent studies have identified therapy-resistant large polyploid cancer cells in patient tissues, particularly in late-stage prostate cancer, linking them to advanced disease and relapse. Here, we analyzed bone marrow aspirates from 44 advanced prostate cancer patients and found the presence of circulating tumor cells with increased genomic content (CTC-IGC) was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival. Single cell copy number profiling of CTC-IGC displayed clonal origins with typical CTCs, suggesting complete polyploidization. Induced polyploid cancer cells from PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with docetaxel or cisplatin were examined through single cell DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and protein immunofluorescence. Novel RNA and protein markers, including HOMER1, TNFRSF9, and LRP1, were identified as linked to chemotherapy resistance. These markers were also present in a subset of patient CTCs and are associated with recurrence in public gene expression data. This study highlights the prognostic significance of large polyploid tumor cells, their role in chemotherapy resistance, and the expression of markers tied to cancer relapse, offering new potential avenues for therapeutic development."
39578447,A proteogenomic analysis of cervical cancer reveals therapeutic and biological insights.,"Although the incidence of cervical cancer (CC) has been reduced in high-income countries due to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and screening strategies, it remains a significant public health issue that poses a threat to women's health in low-income countries. Here, we perform a comprehensive proteogenomic profiling of CC tumors obtained from 139 Chinese women. Integrated proteogenomic analysis links genetic aberrations to downstream pathogenesis-related pathways and reveals the landscape of HPV-associated multi-omic changes. EP300 is found to enhance the acetylation of FOSL2-K222, consequently accelerating the malignant proliferation of CC cells. Proteomic stratification identifies three patient subgroups with distinct features in prognosis, genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and post-translational modification regulations. PRKCB is further identified as a potential radioresponse-related biomarker of CC patients. This study provides a valuable public resource for researchers and clinicians to delve into the molecular basis of CC, to identify potential treatments and to ultimately advance clinical practice."
39577422,Elucidating acquired PARP inhibitor resistance in advanced prostate cancer.,"PARP inhibition (PARPi) has anti-tumor activity against castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with homologous recombination repair (HRR) defects. However, mechanisms underlying PARPi resistance are not fully understood. While acquired mutations restoring BRCA genes are well documented, their clinical relevance, frequency, and mechanism of generation remain unclear. Moreover, how resistance emerges in BRCA2 homozygously deleted (HomDel) CRPC is unknown. Evaluating samples from patients with metastatic CRPC treated in the TOPARP-B trial, we identify reversion mutations in most BRCA2/PALB2-mutated tumors (79%) by end of treatment. Among reversions mediated by frameshift deletions, 60% are flanked by DNA microhomologies, implicating POLQ-mediated repair. The number of reversions and time of their detection associate with radiological progression-free survival and overall survival (p < 0.01). For BRCA2 HomDels, selection for rare subclones without BRCA2-HomDel is observed following PARPi, confirmed by single circulating-tumor-cell genomics, biopsy fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNAish. These data support the need for restored HRR function in PARPi resistance."
39576211,Phase Ib Pharmacodynamic Study of the MNK Inhibitor Tomivosertib (eFT508) Combined With Paclitaxel in Patients With Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Preclinical data motivate clinical evaluation of inhibitors of MAPK-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2). We conducted a phase 1b clinical trial to study target engagement and safety of tomivosertib, a MNK1/2 inhibitor, alone and in combination with paclitaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had metastatic breast cancer resistant to standard-of-care treatments. Biopsies were obtained at baseline and during treatment with tomivosertib, and then tomivosertib was continued with the addition of paclitaxel until disease progression or toxicity. Serum drug levels were measured, and pharmacodynamic endpoints included IHC, proteomics, translatomics, and imaging mass cytometry. RESULTS: Tomivosertib alone and in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs. We observed a clear reduction in phosphorylation of eIF4E at S209, a major substrate of MNK1/2, and identified tomivosertib-induced perturbations in the proteome, translatome, and cellular populations of biopsied metastatic breast cancer tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that tomivosertib effectively inhibits MNK1/2 activity in metastatic breast cancer tissue and that it can safely be combined with paclitaxel in future phase II studies. We demonstrate feasibility of using proteomic profiles, translatomic profiles, and spatial distribution of immune cell infiltrates for clinical pharmacodynamic studies."
39574839,Isoform-level analyses of 6 cancers uncover extensive genetic risk mechanisms undetected at the gene-level.,"Integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptomic datasets can help identify potential mediators for germline genetic risk of cancer. However, traditional methods have been largely unsuccessful because of an overreliance on total gene expression. These approaches overlook alternative splicing, which can produce multiple isoforms from the same gene, each with potentially different effects on cancer risk. Here, we integrate genetic and multi-tissue isoform-level gene expression data from the Genotype Tissue-Expression Project (GTEx, N = 108-574) with publicly available European-ancestry GWAS summary statistics (all N > 20,000 cases) to identify both isoform- and gene-level risk associations with six cancers (breast, endometrial, colorectal, lung, ovarian, prostate) and six related cancer subtype classifications (N = 12 total). Compared to traditional methods leveraging total gene expression, directly modeling isoform expression through transcriptome-wide association studies (isoTWAS) substantially increases discovery of transcriptomic mechanisms underlying genetic associations. Using the same RNA-seq datasets, isoTWAS identified 164% more significant unique gene associations compared to TWAS (6,163 and 2,336, respectively), with isoTWAS-prioritized genes enriched 4-fold for evolutionarily-constrained genes (P = 6.1 x 10(-13)). isoTWAS tags transcriptomic associations at 52% more independent GWAS loci compared to TWAS across the six cancers. Additionally, isoform expression mediates an estimated 63% greater proportion of cancer risk SNP heritability compared to gene expression when evaluating cis-genetic influence on isoform expression. We highlight several notable isoTWAS associations that demonstrate GWAS colocalization at the isoform level but not at the gene level, including, CLPTM1L (lung cancer), LAMC1 (colorectal), and BABAM1 (breast). These results underscore the critical importance of modeling isoform-level expression to maximize discovery of genetic risk mechanisms for cancers."
39574035,ClassifieR 2.0: expanding interactive gene expression-based stratification to prostate and high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Advances in transcriptional profiling methods have enabled the discovery of molecular subtypes within and across traditional tissue-based cancer classifications. Such molecular subgroups hold potential for improving patient outcomes by guiding treatment decisions and revealing physiological distinctions and targetable pathways. Computational methods for stratifying transcriptomic data into molecular subgroups are increasingly abundant. However, assigning samples to these subtypes and other transcriptionally inferred predictions is time-consuming and requires significant bioinformatics expertise. To address this need, we recently reported ""ClassifieR,"" a flexible, interactive cloud application for the functional annotation of colorectal and breast cancer transcriptomes. Here, we report ""ClassifieR 2.0"" which introduces additional modules for the molecular subtyping of prostate and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). RESULTS: ClassifieR 2.0 introduces ClassifieRp and ClassifieRov, two specialised modules specifically designed to address the challenges of prostate and HGSOC molecular classification. ClassifieRp includes sigInfer, a method we developed to infer commercial prognostic prostate gene expression signatures from publicly available gene-lists or indeed any user-uploaded gene-list. ClassifieRov utilizes consensus molecular subtyping methods for HGSOC, including tools like consensusOV, for accurate ovarian cancer stratification. Both modules include functionalities present in the original ClassifieR framework for estimating cellular composition, predicting transcription factor (TF) activity and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). CONCLUSIONS: ClassifieR 2.0 combines molecular subtyping of prostate cancer and HGSOC with commonly used sample annotation tools in a single, user-friendly platform, allowing scientists without bioinformatics training to explore prostate and HGSOC transcriptional data without the need for extensive bioinformatics knowledge or manual data handling to operate various packages. Our sigInfer method within ClassifieRp enables the inference of commercially available gene signatures for prostate cancer, while ClassifieRov incorporates consensus molecular subtyping for HGSOC. Overall, ClassifieR 2.0 aims to make molecular subtyping more accessible to the wider research community. This is crucial for increased understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of these cancers and developing personalised treatment strategies."
39571305,Quinazoline derivatives inhibit cell growth of prostate cancer as a WRN helicase dependent manner by regulating DNA damage repair and microsatellite instability.,"WRN helicase is a crucial target of synthetic death in cancer and has a unique advantage in the treatment of microsatellite unstable cancers. Our previous studies have found that quinazoline derivatives showed the WRN-dependent antiproliferative activity. In this study, a series of new quinazoline derivatives were designed and synthesized by optimizing the structure, and evaluating the targeting and sensitivity to WRN helicase. Cell growth inhibition experiments on WRN overexpressing PC3 cells (PC3-WRN) showed that the antiproliferative activity of some compounds was significantly dependent on WRN helicase. Moreover, the antitumor activity of 9in vivo was significantly decreased in the nude mouse model constructed with WRN knockdown PC3 cells (PC3-shWRN) compare (P < 0.01) to the control group. The molecular docking and CETSA results showed that 9 directly binds to WRN protein. Mechanism studies have confirmed that 9 targeted WRN, and may affect the binding between WRN and other key regulators, to destroy the repair function and regulate genomic stability. In addition, 9 also has suitable pharmacokinetic parameters and low toxicity in vivo. This result indicates that the quinazoline derivative 9 could be a novel WRN function inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer."
39568334,Establishment and validation of predictive model of prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is a prevalent malignant disease among middle-aged and elderly men. Its prevention and detection are significant public health issues. We aimed to construct an interpretable model for predicting death risk in prostate cancer patients. We performed model development using the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression databases. In comparison among models, the SVM model has the highest prediction performance among the eight models. The SHAP method, sorted by importance, reveals the top eight predictors of prostate cancer disease. This effective computer-aided approach can facilitate frontline clinicians in the diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer."
39567960,Cancer-associated fibroblasts reveal aberrant DNA methylation across different types of cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are essential components of the tumor microenvironment and play a critical role in cancer progression. Numerous studies have identified significant molecular differences between CAFs and normal tissue-associated fibroblasts (NAFs). In this study, we isolated CAFs and NAFs from liver tumors and conducted a comprehensive analysis of their DNA methylation profiles, integrating our finding with data from studies on other cancer types. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that several CAF samples exhibited aberrant DNA methylation patterns, which corresponded with altered gene expression levels. Notably, DNA methylation at liver CAF-specific CpG sites was linked to survival outcomes in liver cancer datasets. An integrative analysis using publicly available datasets from various cancer types, including lung, prostate, esophageal, and gastric cancers, uncovered common epigenetic abnormalities across these cancers. Among the consistently altered CpGs were cg09809672 (EDARADD), cg07134930 (HDAC4), and cg05935904 (intergenic). These methylation changes were associated with prognosis across multiple cancer types. CONCLUSION: The activation of CAFs by the tumor microenvironment seems to be associated with distinct epigenetic modifications. Remarkably, similar genomic regions tend to undergo hypomethylation in CAFs across different studies and cancer types. Our findings suggest that CAF-associated DNA methylation changes hold potential as prognostic biomarkers. However, further research and validation are necessary to develop and apply such signatures in a clinical setting."
39567499,Increased translation driven by non-canonical EZH2 creates a synthetic vulnerability in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.,"Overcoming resistance to therapy is a major challenge in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Lineage plasticity towards a neuroendocrine phenotype enables CRPC to adapt and survive targeted therapies. However, the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming during this process are still poorly understood. Here we show that the protein kinase PKClambda/iota-mediated phosphorylation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) regulates its proteasomal degradation and maintains EZH2 as part of the canonical polycomb repressive complex (PRC2). Loss of PKClambda/iota promotes a switch during enzalutamide treatment to a non-canonical EZH2 cistrome that triggers the transcriptional activation of the translational machinery to induce a transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) resistance program. The increased reliance on protein synthesis creates a synthetic vulnerability in PKClambda/iota-deficient CRPC."
39561921,Design of a pragmatic trial integrating human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling into primary care to reduce cervical cancer screening disparities in Somali American individuals: The Isbaar project.,"BACKGROUND: Somali American individuals have lower cervical cancer screening rates than the U.S. general population. Offering HPV self-sampling in primary care clinics could increase screening rates in Somali American individuals by addressing screening barriers. METHODS: The Isbaar Project is a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation study of a patient-centered, culturally tailored HPV self-sampling intervention for Somali American individuals. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Social Cognitive Theory, we conducted focus groups with Somali American individuals, and interviews with clinicians and clinic staff to inform refinement and development of implementation strategies. HPV self-sampling was then implemented as a usual care screening option at 3 community-based primary care clinics in Minneapolis, Minnesota in February 2023. The primary objective is to assess the effect of implementing in-clinic HPV self-sampling on screening completion in Somali American individuals. The secondary objective is to assess the effect of implementing HPV self-sampling on screening completion in all patients. Using difference-in-difference methods, we will evaluate changes in screening rates one-year pre and post implementation and compare changes with control clinics followed over the same time period. Using RE-AIM, we will conduct a post-implementation mixed methods analysis of processes and strategies needed to successfully implement HPV self-sampling in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: The study was designed to evaluate a real-world in-clinic HPV self-sampling intervention for Somali American individuals, generating data on both effectiveness and implementation applicable to other community-based clinics in the U.S. The objective of this report is to describe the rationale and design of the study."
39560645,Small-molecule disruption of androgen receptor-dependent chromatin clusters.,"Sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling during relapse is a central driver of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Current AR antagonists, such as enzalutamide, fail to provide long-term benefit for the mCRPC patients who have dramatic increases in AR expression. Here, we report AR antagonists with efficacy in AR-overexpressing models. These molecules bind to the ligand-binding domain of the AR, promote AR localization to the nucleus, yet potently and selectively down-regulate AR-target genes. The molecules BG-15a and the pharmacokinetically optimized BG-15n elicit a decrease in cell and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in models of mCRPC. BG-15a/n treatment causes the collapse of chromatin loops between enhancers and promoters at key genes in the AR-driven epigenome. AR binding in the promoter, as well as 3D chromatin clustering, is needed for genes to respond. BG-15a/n represent promising agents for treating patients with relapsed AR-driven mCRPC tumors."
39560511,Bioinformatics-based screening of hub genes for prostate cancer bone metastasis and analysis of immune infiltration.,"Bioinformatics analysis of genes and immune cells that influence prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastases. Using the gene expression omnibus database, we analyzed a PCa bone metastasis dataset. Differentially expressed genes were identified through the utilization of GEO2R and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis software was used to identify important pathways. In addition to creating a network of protein-protein interactions, functional enrichment analyses were conducted using Kyoto encyclopedia of genes databases. To screen hub genes, Cytoscape software was used with the CytoHubba plug-in and performed mRNA and survival curve validation analysis of key genes using the cBioPortal website and GEPIA2 database. Immune infiltration analysis was performed using the CIBERSORTx website, and finally, immune cell correlation analysis was performed for key genes according to the TIMER database. A total of 197 PCa bone metastasis risk genes were screened, ""G2M_CHECKPOINT"" was significantly enriched in PCa bone metastasis samples according to genomic enrichment analysis. Based on the protein interactions network, we have identified 10 alternative hub genes, and 3 hub genes, CCNA2, NUSAP1, and PBK, were validated by the cBioPortal website and the GEPIA2 database. T cells regulatory and macrophages M0 may influence PCa to metastasize to bones, according to CIBERSORTx immune cell infiltration analysis. TIMER database analysis found different degrees of correlation between 3 key genes and major immune cells. PCa bone metastasis has been associated with CCNA2, NUSAP1, and PBK. T cells regulatory and macrophages (M0) may also be involved."
39558374,Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CARMN and its anti-tumor function in cervical cancer through autophagic flux blockade and MAPK cascade inhibition.,"BACKGROUND: LncRNAs play essential roles in multiple tumors. However, research on genome-wide lncRNA alterations and their functions in cervical cancer (CC) is limited. This study aims to explore key lncRNAs in CC progression and uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of CC. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 30 tissues from CC, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and normal (NOR) using transcriptome sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to establish gene modules related to the NOR-CIN-CC transition. Machine learning diagnostic models were employed to investigate the role of lncRNAs in this transition. Molecular biological experiments were conducted to elucidate the potential mechanisms of CARMN in CC, with a particular focus on its transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of abnormal expression in CC. RESULTS: CARMN was identified as a hub gene in two modules significantly associated with the NOR-CIN-CC transition. Analysis using ten machine learning models confirmed its critical role in this progression. The results of RNA-seq, qPCR and RNAScope performed in another cohort of 83 cervical tissues all showed that CARMN was significantly downregulated in CC. CARMN significantly enhanced the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2, leading to increased ROS levels. The elevated ROS levels suppressed the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, leading to autophagy arrest via autophagic flux blockade. Additionally, CARMN interacted with TFAP2alpha to repress MAPK13 transcription, further inhibiting the MAPK cascade. A promoter SNP (rs12517403) was found to increase CC risk (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.11-1.61) and reduce CARMN expression by decreasing SP1 binding. Furthermore, the RNA binding proteins that could modulate CARMN RNA stability were also determined using RNA-pulldown assay. The results demonstrated that YBX1, a component of the coding region instability determinant (CRD)-mediated mRNA stabilization complex, promoted CARMN RNA stability. DHX9, another component of complex, acted as a scaffold to bridge YBX1 and CARMN. CONCLUSIONS: CARMN exerts an anti-cancer effect in CC progression by inhibiting the Akt-mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. rs12517403 and the YBX1/DHX9 complex are key mechanisms influencing its transcription and stability in CC cells. CARMN represents a promising biomarker for CC diagnosis and therapeutic target."
39558312,Correlation between benign prostatic hyperplasia and comorbidities: a systematic analysis integrating global burden of disease and mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common chronic condition in elderly men. Observational studies have identified several comorbidities associated with BPH. However, these studies are limited by various confounding factors and do not clearly explain the association between BPH and its comorbidities. We investigated the association between BPH and comorbidities using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database combined with Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. METHODS: Through an extensive PubMed search, we identified 22 diseases associated with BPH and selected 9 significant comorbidities from the GBD database for a detailed correlation analysis. We also considered socio-economic and environmental influences on BPH. Utilizing the GWAS database, we gathered data on BPH and 20 comorbidities, employing the Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) method to unearth genetic connections. Causality was determined through both univariable and multivariable bidirectional MR analyses, supplemented by Steiger directionality tests to confirm causation. The study's integrity was fortified by employing various MR models and conducting rigorous sensitivity analyses. The synthesis of GBD data with LDSC and MR findings offered a nuanced understanding of the BPH-comorbidity nexus. Additionally, we explored the genetic basis and the role of mediating factors between BPH and comorbidities through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), colocalization analysis, and mediation MR. RESULTS: Correlation analysis of GBD data found associations of prostate cancer, chronic kidney disease and depression with BPH. LDSC results indicated that prostatitis and bladder cancer are related to BPH. Two associations were replicated in bidirectional univariable MR, linking BPH with a higher risk of prostatitis and prostate cancer. conducted sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of the results and all Steiger directionality tests were correct. Multiple multivariable MR models validated these results. PheWAS analysis showed that outliers in MR do not significantly impact MR results. Through colocalization analysis, three shared loci between BPH and both prostatitis and prostate cancer were identified. Mediation analysis found that, after adjusting for BPH, fruit consumption was associated with a lower risk of prostatitis, and morning person and chronotype were associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered associations between BPH and various comorbidities, emphasizing the causal relationships between BPH, prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Our research provides a new perspective in understanding the comorbid associations of BPH."
39558146,Transcription and DNA replication collisions lead to large tandem duplications and expose targetable therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer.,"Despite the abundance of somatic structural variations (SVs) in cancer, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their formation remain unclear. In the present study, we used 6,193 whole-genome sequenced tumors to study the contributions of transcription and DNA replication collisions to genome instability. After deconvoluting robust SV signatures in three independent pan-cancer cohorts, we detected transcription-dependent, replicated-strand bias, the expected footprint of transcription-replication collision (TRC), in large tandem duplications (TDs). Large TDs are abundant in female-enriched, upper gastrointestinal tract and prostate cancers. They are associated with poor patient survival and mutations in TP53, CDK12 and SPOP. Upon inactivating CDK12, cells display significantly more TRCs, R-loops and large TDs. Inhibition of WEE1, CHK1 and ATR selectively inhibits the growth of cells deficient in CDK12. Our data suggest that large TDs in cancer form as a result of TRCs and their presence can be used as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment."
39554302,Genetic Predisposition to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Where Do We Stand?,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Genetic predisposition is a factor in 40-70% of cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and voiding symptoms. However, informal reviews summarizing genes and variants imparting genetic disposition to BPH are not yet available. METHODS: We conducted an informal narrative review of genes and variants associated with BPH or voiding symptoms in candidate gene studies, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and Mendelian randomization studies. A literature search of PubMed was performed using the terms ""BPH heritability"", ""LUTS heritability"", ""BPH risk variant"", ""LUTS genetic risk"", ""GWAS BPH"", and ""genome-wide BPH"". KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Candidate gene studies focused on variants related to the vitamin D receptor, steroid metabolism, detoxification, inflammation, cytokines, and growth factors, which were previously found to be associated with prostate cancer. Despite overall limited conclusiveness of candidate gene approaches, some recent studies point to population-dependent contributions of single variants to genetic BPH predisposition. Four GWAS and two Mendelian randomization studies for BPH identified correlation of BPH and voiding symptoms with variants related to testosterone, prostate-specific antigen, progesterone, transcription factors, the cell cycle, neuronal organization, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The drug targetability of most of the genes identified in the BPH setting is precluded by predictable unbalanced side effects, low efficacy, unknown organ specificity, and a lack of characterization in the prostate. Meta-analyses of GWAS are not yet available for BPH. Unless calculated using quantitative approaches, specific contributions of the risk variants identified to the overall risk of BPH remain uncertain. PATIENT SUMMARY: While age is a risk factor for benign enlargement of the prostate in all affected patients, genetic factors may be involved in 39-72% of patients. Research has identified a number of possible risk genes, but is still at a very early stage. It is unlikely that drugs could be used to target these genes because of expected side effects that would be tolerated for cancer treatment, but not for benign diseases, or low efficacy in previous clinical trials."
39553982,Single-Cell Proteomic and Transcriptomic Characterization of Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Reveals Molecular Signatures Associated with Morphological Changes.,"This study delves into the proteomic intricacies of drug-resistant cells (DRCs) within prostate cancer, which are known for their pivotal roles in therapeutic resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Utilizing single-cell proteomics (SCP) with an optimized high-throughput Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) approach with the throughput of 60 sample per day, we characterized the proteomic landscape of DRCs in comparison to parental PC3 cells. This optimized DIA method allowed for robust and reproducible protein quantification at the single-cell level, enabling the identification and quantification of over 1,300 proteins per cell on average. Distinct proteomic sub-clusters within the DRC population were identified, closely linked to variations in cell size. The study uncovered novel protein signatures, including the regulation of proteins critical for cell adhesion and metabolic processes, as well as the upregulation of surface proteins and transcription factors pivotal for cancer progression. Furthermore, by integrating SCP and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, we identified six upregulated and ten downregulated genes consistently altered in drug-treated cells across both SCP and scRNA-seq platforms. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of DRCs and their unique molecular signatures, providing valuable insights into their biological behavior and potential therapeutic targets."
39550701,Nodularin-R Synergistically Enhances Abiraterone Against Castrate- Resistant Prostate Cancer via PPP1CA Inhibition.,"Clinically, most prostate cancer (PCa) patients inevitably progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with poor prognosis after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including abiraterone, the drug of choice for ADT. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the resistance mechanism of abiraterone in depth. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout technology was used to screen CRPC cell line 22Rv1 for abiraterone-resistant genes. Combined with bioinformatics, a key gene with high expression and poor prognosis in CRPC patients was screened. Then, the effects of target gene on abiraterone-resistant 22Rv1 cell function were explored by silencing and overexpression. Further, a natural product with potential targeting effect was identified and validated by molecular docking and protein expression. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed potential mechanism for the natural product affecting target protein expression. Finally, the combined anti-CRPC effects of the natural product and abiraterone were validated by cellular and in vivo experiments. Five common resistance genes (KCNJ3, COL2A1, PPP1CA, MDH2 and EXOSC5) were identified successfully, among which high PPP1CA expression had the worst prognosis for disease-free survival. Moreover, PPP1CA was highly expressed in abiraterone-resistant 22Rv1 cells. Silencing PPP1CA increased cell sensitivity to abiraterone while promoting apoptosis and inhibiting clone formation. Overexpressing PPP1CA exerted the opposite effects. Molecular docking revealed the binding mode of the natural product nodularin-R to PPP1CA with a dose-dependent manner for inhibition. Mechanistically, nodularin-R attenuates the interaction between PPP1CA and USP11 (deubiquitinating enzyme), potentially promoting PPP1CA degradation. Additionally, combination of 2.72 muM nodularin-R and 54.5 muM abiraterone synergistically inhibited the resistant 22Rv1 cell function. In vivo experiments also revealed that combination therapy significantly inhibited tumour growth and reduced inducible expression of PPP1CA. PPP1CA is a key driver for abiraterone resistance, and nodularin-R enhances the anti-CRPC effects of abiraterone by inhibiting PPP1CA."
39550583,Integrated proteomics and metabolomics analyses reveal new insights into the antitumor effects of valproic acid plus simvastatin combination in a prostate cancer xenograft model associated with downmodulation of YAP/TAZ signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, including taxane-based chemotherapy and androgen receptor-targeting agents, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains an incurable tumor, highlighting the need for novel strategies that can target the complexities of this disease and bypass the development of drug resistance mechanisms. We previously demonstrated the synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid (VPA), an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity, with the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin (SIM). This combination sensitizes mCRPC cells to docetaxel treatment both in vitro and in vivo by targeting the cancer stem cell compartment via mevalonate pathway/YAP axis modulation. METHODS: Here, using a combined proteomic and metabolomic/lipidomic approach, we characterized tumor samples derived from 22Rv1 mCRPC cell-xenografted mice treated with or without VPA/SIM and performed an in-depth bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed the specific impact of VPA/SIM on the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway, which is functionally related to the modulation of cancer-related extracellular matrix biology and metabolic reprogramming, providing further insights into the molecular mechanism of the antitumor effects of VPA/SIM. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present an in-depth exploration of the potential to repurpose two generic, safe drugs for mCRPC treatment, valproic acid (VPA) and simvastatin (SIM), which already show antitumor efficacy in combination, primarily affecting the cancer stem cell compartment via MVP/YAP axis modulation. Bioinformatics analysis of the LC‒MS/MS and (1)H‒NMR metabolomics/lipidomics results confirmed the specific impact of VPA/SIM on Hippo-YAP."
39550375,Single cell and spatial transcriptomics highlight the interaction of club-like cells with immunosuppressive myeloid cells in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer treatment resistance is a significant challenge facing the field. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling have partially elucidated the mechanisms through which cancer cells escape treatment, but their relation toward the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of the prostate TME at multiple points in the standard treatment timeline employing single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data from 120 patients. We identify club-like cells as a key epithelial cell subtype that acts as an interface between the prostate and the immune system. Tissue areas enriched with club-like cells have depleted androgen signaling and upregulated expression of luminal progenitor cell markers. Club-like cells display a senescence-associated secretory phenotype and their presence is linked to increased polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) activity. Our results indicate that club-like cells are associated with myeloid inflammation previously linked to androgen deprivation therapy resistance, providing a rationale for their therapeutic targeting."
39549024,"Myoepithelial-Rich Pleomorphic Adenoma With Novel PLAG1 Inversion on Chromosome 8, and LRP1B, PBRM1 and TCF3 Mutations.","Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common salivary gland neoplasm worldwide (50%-70%). Most cases of PA are straightforward diagnoses. However, the diagnosis may be challenging due to the morphological diversity of PAs, which in many cases is caused by the predominance of one of the three components or the presence of metaplastic epithelium. We present the case of a 64-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer and right submandibular gland excision 16 years ago with an unknown previous diagnosis and recent regrowth of his mass in the surgical bed. The tumour showed a predominant spindle cell morphology, cytokeratin-positivity, variable expression of myoepithelial markers in the cytology and surgical pathology specimens, and novel inversion of the chromosome 8, and LRP1B, PBRM1 and TCF3 mutations."
39547899,Colibactin Exerts Androgen-dependent and -independent Effects on Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The etiology of prostate cancer (PC) is multifactorial and poorly understood. It has been suggested that colibactin-producing Escherichia coli positive for the pathogenicity island pks (pks(+)) initiate cancers via induction of genomic instability. In PC, androgens promote oncogenic translocations. Our aim was to investigate the association of pks(+)E. coli with PC diagnosis and molecular architecture, and its relationship with androgens. METHODS: We quantified the association of pks(+)E. coli with PC diagnosis in a volunteer-sampled 235-person cohort from two institutional practices (UT San Antonio). We then used colibactin 742 and DNA/RNA sequencing to evaluate the effects of colibactin 742, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and their combination in vitro. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Colibactin exposure was positively associated with PC diagnosis (p = 0.04) in our clinical cohort, and significantly increased replication fork stalling and fusions in vitro (p < 0.01). Combined in vitro exposure to colibactin 742 and DHT induced more somatic mutations of all types than exposure to either alone. The combination also elicited kataegis, with a higher density of somatic point mutations. Laboratory analyses were conducted using a single cell line, which limited our ability to fully recapitulate the complexity of PC etiology. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our findings are consistent with synergistic induction of genome instability and kataegis by colibactin 742 and DHT in cell culture. Colibactin-producing pks(+) E. coli may plausibly contribute to PC etiology. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated whether a bacterial toxin that is linked to colon cancer can also cause prostate cancer. Our results support this idea by showing a link between the toxin and prostate cancer diagnosis in a large patient population. We also found that this toxin causes genetic dysfunction in prostate cancer cells when combined with testosterone."
39547766,Pathophysiology of Anal Cancer.,"The pathophysiology of the development of anal cancer is thought to be linked to chronic inflammation, a possible consequence of infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) or HIV, or inflammation from inflammatory bowel disease. Anal HPV-induced carcinogenesis bears similarities to its cervical counterpart via viral integration into the host genome and the development of precursor lesions termed anal intraepithelial neoplasia. HPV-16 and -18 are the most common HPV genotypes associated with anal cancer. Other risk factors for the development of anal cancer include chronic immunosuppression, sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases, female gender, history of anogenital dysplasia, and smoking."
39547665,Causal relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to explore the relation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) from a genetic level utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: The IEU genome-wide association studies database was surveyed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BPH, PCa, and PCa (validation cohort). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were subjected to stringent quality control based on rigorous screening criteria. BPH and PCa risk were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted method (IVW), MR-Egger, simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode. Horizontal pleiotropy of single nucleotide polymorphisms was assessed using the MR-Egger intercept test, while heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test. Reverse causality was assessed by evaluating PCa as the exposure and BPH as the outcome. A validation database was used to verify the exposure and outcome. RESULTS: The risk of PCa increased significantly with genetically predicted BPH (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 1.3849 x 107 [2330, 8.2294 x 1010], P = 2.0814 x 10-4). In reverse MR analysis, PCa also increased the risk of BPH (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 1.0011 [1.0003, 1.0019], P = 0.0031). The findings were consistent with the MR analysis results of the PCa validation cohort. Sensitivity analyses indicated the presence of heterogeneity but no horizontal pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: The study presents proof of a significant bidirectional causal relationship between genetically predicted BPH and an increased risk of PCa. Key message Three research questions and three bullet points  What is already known on this topic?  Observational studies suggest a controversial relationship between BPH and PCa. MR allows investigation of causality using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs). What does this study add?  The study presents proof of a significant bidirectional causal relationship between genetically predicted BPH and an increased risk of PCa. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy?  Recognizing the bidirectional relationship between BPH and PCa, men diagnosed with BPH may benefit from more stringent PCa screening protocols."
39546308,Racial and Ethnic Differences in Prostate Cancer Epidemiology Across Disease States in the VA.,"IMPORTANCE: Prostate cancer (PC) care has evolved rapidly as a result of changes in prostate-specific antigen testing, novel imaging, and newer treatments. The impact of these changes on PC epidemiology and racial disparities across disease states remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To characterize racial and ethnic differences in the epidemiology of PC states, including nonmetastatic hormone-sensitive PC (nmHSPC), metastatic HSPC (mHSPC), nonmetastatic castration-resistant PC (nmCRPC), and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective, population-based cohort study of male US veterans aged 40 years and older with known race and ethnicity and no non-PC malignant neoplasm before study entry receiving care through the Veterans Health Administration. The study period was from 2012 to 2020, with follow-up through 2021. To identify active users, data capture included visits 18 months before and after the study period. Data analysis was performed from March to August 2023. EXPOSURE: Self-identified race and ethnicity, classified as Black, White, or Hispanic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were annual age-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) and point prevalence for PC states by race and ethnicity. Trends were evaluated using joinpoint regression. Time to disease progression or death was estimated using nonparametric cumulative incidence. Competing risk models adjusted for age assessed the association of race and ethnicity on disease progression. RESULTS: The study included 6 539 001 veterans (median [IQR] age, 65 [56-74] years), of whom 476 227 had PC (median [IQR] age, 69 [63-75] years). IRs varied by time frame and disease state. Across all states and years, the relative risk among Black vs White patients ranged from 2.09 (95% CI, 2.01-2.18; P < .001) for nmHSPC in 2012 to 4.12 (95% CI, 3.39-5.02; P < .001) for nmCRPC in 2017. In nmHSPC, hazard ratios for progression to mHSPC and nmCRPC were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.33-1.40) and 1.60 (95% CI, 1.51-1.70), respectively, for Black patients and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.31-1.45) and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.40-1.72), respectively, for Hispanic patients vs White patients. In contrast, in mCRPC, the hazard ratio for death was lower for Black (0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88) and Hispanic (0.76; 95% CI, 0.69-0.83) patients compared with White patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of veterans found that Black patients had more than 2-fold higher incidence of all disease states vs White patients. Progression risk was higher for Black and Hispanic patients in early-stage disease, but lower in later disease stages. Despite equal access, Black patients disproportionately experience PC, although progression risks relative to White patients differed according to disease state."
39543761,A genome-wide association study in Swedish colorectal cancer patients with gastric- and prostate cancer in relatives.,"BACKGROUND: A complex inheritance has been suggested in families with colorectal-, gastric- and prostate cancer. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in colorectal cancer patients, who's relatives had prostate-, and/or gastric cancer. METHODS: The GWAS analysis consisted of 685 cases of colorectal cancer and 4780 healthy controls from Sweden. A sliding window haplotype analysis was conducted using a logistic regression model. Thereafter, we performed sequencing to find candidate variants, finally to be tested in a nested case-control study. RESULTS: Candidate loci/genes on ten chromosomal regions were suggested with odds ratios between 1.71-3.62 and p-values < 5 x 10-8 in the analysis. The regions suggested were 1q32.2, 3q29, 4q35.1, 4p15.31, 4q26, 8p23.1, 13q33.3, 13q13.3, 16q23.3 and 22q11.21. All regions, except one on 1q32.2, had protein coding genes, many already shown to be involved in cancer, such as ZDHHC19, SYNPO2, PCYT1A, MYO16, TXNRD2, COMT, and CDH13. Sequencing of DNA from 122 colorectal cancer patients with gastric- and/or prostate cancer in their families was performed to search for candidate variants in the haplotype regions. The identified candidate variants were tested in a nested case-control study of similar colorectal cancer cases and controls. There was some support for an increased risk of colorectal-, gastric-, and/or prostate cancer in all the six loci tested. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a proof of principle strategy to identify risk variants found by GWAS, and identified ten candidate loci that could be associated with colorectal, gastric- and prostate cancer."
39542826,"Biopsy-based Basal-luminal Subtyping Classifier in High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Combined Analysis of the NRG Oncology/RTOG 9202, 9413, and 9902 Phase 3 Trials.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Long-term (LT) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been found to be beneficial to patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, administration of LT-ADT to all patients with high-risk PCa may lead to overtreatment. Enhanced risk stratification using genomic classifiers (such as the recently developed prostate subtyping classifier [PSC]) might be useful. This study aims to characterize the prognostic and predictive ability of the PSC in patients with high-risk PCa undergoing radiotherapy long-term (LT; 24-28 mo) versus short-term (ST; 4 mo) ADT. METHODS: Biopsy samples from three randomized, phase 3 trials-NRG/RTOG 9202, 9413, and 9902-were classified as either PSC basal or luminal. The prognostic and predictive values of PSC for each oncologic endpoint (biochemical failure [BF], distant metastasis [DM], metastasis-free survival [MFS], PCa-specific mortality [PCSM], overall survival [OS]) and other cause-mortality (OCM) were assessed with Cox proportional hazards (MFS, OCM, and OS), Fine-Gray (BF, DM, and PCSM), and restricted mean survival time (RMST) models. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: On a multivariable analysis, the basal subtype was found to have a worse prognosis for MFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8 [1.3-2.5], p < 0.001), PCSM (subdistribution HR 2.4 [95% confidence interval CI 1.4-4.1], p = 0.001), and OS (HR 1.8 [1.3-2.6], p < 0.001). Ten-year PCSM was 15% better for the luminal subtype than for the basal subtype (11% [95% CI 6-15%] vs 26% [95% CI 17-35%]). A significant interaction between ADT duration (LT vs ST) and PSC subtype (basal vs luminal) was observed for PCSM (p(interaction) = 0.008), leading to the observation that 10-yr PCSM was improved with LT-ADT only in patients with basal-type tumors (5% [95% CI 0-11%] vs 42% [29-56%], p < 0.001). Improvements in 10-yr RMST with LT-ADT were greater for basal tumors for oncologic endpoints with the exception of OCM. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: PSC is both a prognostic and a predictive biomarker for patients who benefit from LT-ADT. PSC subtypes may be used to personalize ADT recommendations for patients with high-risk PCa, pending further validation in a prospective study. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we tried to understand the usefulness of a new genomic test in patients with high-risk, nonmetastatic prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy and hormonal therapy (HT). We found that this test can help determine a patient's prognosis (eg, a patient's chance of having the cancer return) and, more importantly, personalize treatment decisions by understanding which patients may benefit from long-term HT. This has the potential to save many patients who may not benefit from prolonged HT from ""overtreatment"" or the unnecessary side effects of such treatment."
39541986,Tumor architecture and emergence of strong genetic alterations are bottlenecks for clonal evolution in primary prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCA) exhibits high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to study the growth and genetic evolution of PCA. We explored the possible evolutionary patterns and demonstrated that tumor architecture represents a major bottleneck for divergent clonal evolution. Early consecutive acquisition of strong genetic alterations serves as a proxy for the formation of aggressive tumors. A limited number of clonal hierarchy patterns were identified. A biopsy study of synthetic tumors shows complex spatial intermixing of clones and delineates the importance of biopsy extent. Deep whole-exome multiregional next-generation DNA sequencing of the primary tumors from five patients was performed to validate the results, supporting our main findings from mathematical modeling. In conclusion, our model provides qualitatively realistic predictions of PCA genomic evolution, closely aligned with the evidence available from patient samples. We share the code of the model for further studies. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information."
39541765,Germline pathogenic variants in prostate cancer.,"While most prostate cancer is sporadic, evidence suggests that a significant minority of cases have a hereditary component, and germline variants may play a role in this heritability. In this study, we investigated germline pathogenic variants in prostate cancer patients. All genetic variants were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology 2015 guidelines. By retrospectively reviewing patient charts and genetic testing results, we collected clinicopathologic, demographic, and genetic data. Among the 160 prostate cancer patients who met NCCN genetic testing guidelines and underwent germline testing, 41 % had metastatic cancer, while 59 % had localized cancer, mostly high-risk. Nineteen (19) out of the 160 patients (12 %) had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the following genes: MUTYH (3.1 %), ATM (1.9 %), BRCA2 (1.3 %), CHEK2 (1.3 %), PALB2 (1.3 %), HOXB13 (1.3 %), and 5 other genes (BRIP1, LZTR1, TP53, NTHL1, and NBN), each at a frequency of 0.6 %. There was no significant difference in clinicopathologic data (such as age, serum prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and others) between those with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and those without. There was also a lack of significant difference in the number of variants of uncertain significance observed between different racial and ethnic groups. Individuals with a family history of cancer were significantly more likely to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant than those without one (p = 0.002). Overall, our results show the necessity for future research with a larger sample size to better explain the relationship between clinicopathologic data and genetic variants."
39541586,Ferroptosis regulates hemolysis in stored murine and human red blood cells.,"Red blood cell (RBC) metabolism regulates hemolysis during aging in vivo and in the blood bank. However, the genetic underpinnings of RBC metabolic heterogeneity and extravascular hemolysis at population scale are incompletely understood. On the basis of the breeding of 8 founder strains with extreme genetic diversity, the Jackson Laboratory diversity outbred population can capture the impact of genetic heterogeneity in like manner to population-based studies. RBCs from 350 outbred mice, either fresh or stored for 7 days, were tested for posttransfusion recovery, as well as metabolomics and lipidomics analyses. Metabolite and lipid quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped >400 gene-metabolite associations, which we collated into an online interactive portal. Relevant to RBC storage, we identified a QTL hotspot on chromosome 1, mapping on the region coding for the ferrireductase 6-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (Steap3), a transcriptional target to p53. Steap3 regulated posttransfusion recovery, contributing to a ferroptosis-like process of lipid peroxidation, as validated via genetic manipulation in mice. Translational validation of murine findings in humans, STEAP3 polymorphisms were associated with RBC iron content, lipid peroxidation, and in vitro hemolysis in 13 091 blood donors from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study. QTL analyses in humans identified a network of gene products (fatty acid desaturases 1 and 2, epoxide hydrolase 2, lysophosphatidylcholine acetyl-transferase 3, solute carrier family 22 member 16, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, very long chain fatty acid elongase, and phospholipase A2 group VI) associated with altered levels of oxylipins. These polymorphisms were prevalent in donors of African descent and were linked to allele frequency of hemolysis-linked polymorphisms for Steap3 or p53. These genetic variants were also associated with lower hemoglobin increments in thousands of single-unit transfusion recipients from the vein-to-vein database."
39539818,Deep learning-based automatic pipeline system for predicting lateral cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma using computed tomography: A multi-center study.,"OBJECTIVE: The assessment of lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) holds great significance. This study aims to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based automatic pipeline system (DLAPS) for diagnosing LLNM in PTC using computed tomography (CT). METHODS: A total of 1,266 lateral lymph nodes (LLNs) from 519 PTC patients who underwent CT examinations from January 2019 to November 2022 were included and divided into training and validation set, internal test set, pooled external test set, and prospective test set. The DLAPS consists of an auto-segmentation network based on RefineNet model and a classification network based on ensemble model (ResNet, Xception, and DenseNet). The performance of the DLAPS was compared with that of manually segmented DL models, the clinical model, and Node Reporting and Data System (Node-RADS). The improvement of radiologists' diagnostic performance under the DLAPS-assisted strategy was explored. In addition, bulk RNA-sequencing was conducted based on 12 LLNs to reveal the underlying biological basis of the DLAPS. RESULTS: The DLAPS yielded good performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.872, 0.910, and 0.822 in the internal, pooled external, and prospective test sets, respectively. The DLAPS significantly outperformed clinical models (AUC 0.731, P<0.001) and Node-RADS (AUC 0.602, P<0.001) in the internal test set. Moreover, the performance of the DLAPS was comparable to that of the manually segmented deep learning (DL) model with AUCs ranging 0.814-0.901 in three test sets. Furthermore, the DLAPS-assisted strategy improved the performance of radiologists and enhanced inter-observer consistency. In clinical situations, the rate of unnecessary LLN dissection decreased from 33.33% to 7.32%. Furthermore, the DLAPS was associated with the cell-cell conjunction in the microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Using CT images from PTC patients, the DLAPS could effectively segment and classify LLNs non-invasively, and this system had a good generalization ability and clinical applicability."
39537233,The Role of STEAP3 in Pathogenesis of Gliomas: An Independent Prognostic Factor and Regulator of Ferroptosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Gliomas are common intracranial tumors with high malignancy and poor prognosis, classified into glioblastomas (GBM) and low-grade glioma (LGG). However, the regulatory mechanisms of glioma tumorigenesis remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3) in glioma prognosis and explore its potential as a therapeutic target, as well as the ferroptosis-related molecular mechanism in progression of gliomas. METHODS: Cox regression analyses were used to identify prognostic factors of gliomas patients from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and DESeq2 package was used for differential gene expression comparisons between Grade 2 and Grade 4 gliomas. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the STEAP3 expression levels between glioma tissues and normal controls in Xiantao platform, as well as between TCGA glioma samples and GTEx normal samples. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING database information, with hub genes identified through Cytoscape software. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Cell proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation and clone formation assay. GSH and MDA concentration was determined according to kit protocols. The expression of STEAP3, Nrf2, GPX4 was determined by western blotting analysis. RESULTS: Our results revealed that STEAP3 is overexpressed in glioma tissues compared to normal counterparts and correlates with poor overall survival (OS). High STEAP3 expression significantly correlates with various clinical-pathological features such as age, histological type, treatment response, World Health Organization (WHO) grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and survival events. Knockdown STEAP3 inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced erastin-induced ferroptosis in U87 and U138 cells. Moreover, knockdown STEAP3 in glioma cells decreased the GSH levels and increased the production of MDA probably by inhibiting the Nrf2/GPX4 related signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: STEAP3 serves as an independent biomarker for glioma prognosis with significant diagnostic value. High STEAP3 expression was correlated with poor overall outcomes of glioma patients. Knockdown of STEAP3 significantly suppressed the proliferation of glioma cells and increased erastin-induced ferroptosis via Nrf2/GPX4 pathway."
39533998,Anillin actin-binding protein expression correlates with poor prognosis for prostate cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Octamer transcription factor 1 (OCT1), a transcription factor that interacts with androgen receptor, is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. The OCT1 target gene, Anillin actin-binding protein (ANLN), is highly expressed in castration-resistant PCa tissue; however, it remains unclear whether ANLN expression in hormone-sensitive PCa tissue could be used as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis of patients. We aimed to investigate ANLN expression in PCa tissue obtained via radical prostatectomy and its correlation with clinical parameters. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for ANLN was performed on 86 PCa specimens, followed by evaluation using immunoreactivity (IR) scores. Prognosis was analyzed by the log-rank test using the Kaplan-Meier method to generate a cancer-specific survival curve. The correlations between ANLN IR and clinical parameters as well as OCT1 IR were analyzed using the Chi-squared test. RESULTS: The median IR score was 0 for ANLN. Accordingly, given the low median IR score, an IR score of >/=3 was defined as positive. There were 17 (19.8%) ANLN-positive cases, and these cases had a significantly poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that the Gleason score, pathological tumor and lymph node stages, and positive ANLN expression were significant predictors of poor prognosis. Notably, patients with both positive ANLN and high OCT1 expression had a significantly decreased overall survival (p=0.001). CONCLUSION: ANLN, which is a OCT1 target gene especially in castration-resistant PCa, is expressed in a small number of hormone-sensitive PCa cases. Both positive ANLN expression and high OCT1 expression are significantly correlated with poor prognosis for PCa patients."
39524206,Oncogenic role of PMEPA1 and its association with immune exhaustion and TGF-beta activation in HCC.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) plays an oncogenic role in advanced cancer by promoting cell proliferation, metastasis and immunosuppression. PMEPA1 (prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1) has been shown to promote TGF-beta oncogenic effects in other tumour types. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of PMEPA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: We analysed 1,097 tumours from patients with HCC, including discovery (n = 228) and validation (n = 361) cohorts with genomic and clinicopathological data. PMEPA1 levels were assessed by qPCR (n = 228), gene expression data (n = 869) and at the single-cell level (n = 54). Genetically engineered mouse models overexpressing MYC+PMEPA1 compared to MYC were generated and molecular analyses were performed on the HCCs obtained. RESULTS: PMEPA1 was overexpressed in 18% of HCC samples (fold-change >2; n = 201/1,097), a feature associated with TGF-beta signalling activation (p <0.05) and absence of gene body hypomethylation (p <0.01). HCCs showing both TGF-beta signalling and high PMEPA1 levels (12% of cases) were linked to immune exhaustion, late TGF-beta activation, aggressiveness and higher recurrence rates after resection, in contrast to HCCs with only TGF-beta signalling (8%) or PMEPA1 overexpression (9%). Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified PMEPA1 expression in HCC and stromal cells. PMEPA1-expressing tumoural cells were predicted to interact with CD4(+) regulatory T cells and CD4(+) CXCL13(+) and CD8(+) exhausted T cells. In vivo, overexpression of MYC+PMEPA1 led to HCC development in  approximately 60% of mice and a decreased survival compared to mice overexpressing MYC alone (p = 0.014). MYC+PMEPA1 tumours were enriched in TGF-beta signalling, paralleling our human data. CONCLUSIONS: In human HCC, PMEPA1 upregulation is linked to TGF-beta activation, immune exhaustion, and an aggressive phenotype. Overexpression of PMEPA1+MYC led to tumoural development in vivo, demonstrating the oncogenic role of PMEPA1 in HCC for the first time. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: PMEPA1 can enhance the tumour-promoting effects of TGF-beta in cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that PMEPA1 is highly expressed in  approximately 18% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a feature associated with poor prognosis, TGF-beta activation and exhaustion of immune cells. Similarly, in mouse models, PMEPA1 overexpression promotes HCC development, which demonstrates its oncogenic role. The identification of PMEPA1 as oncogenic driver in HCC and its role in immune exhaustion and poor clinical outcomes enhances our understanding of HCC pathogenesis and opens new avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions."
39535029,Enhancing disease risk gene discovery by integrating transcription factor-linked trans-variants into transcriptome-wide association analyses.,"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility genes by integrating cis-variants predicted gene expression with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. However, trans-variants for predicting gene expression remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce transTF-TWAS, which incorporates transcription factor (TF)-linked trans-variants to enhance model building for TF downstream target genes. Using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we predict gene expression and alternative splicing and applied these prediction models to large GWAS datasets for breast, prostate, lung cancers and other diseases. We demonstrate that transTF-TWAS outperforms other existing TWAS approaches in both constructing gene expression prediction models and identifying disease-associated genes, as shown by simulations and real data analysis. Our transTF-TWAS approach significantly contributes to the discovery of disease risk genes. Findings from this study shed new light on several genetically driven key TF regulators and their associated TF-gene regulatory networks underlying disease susceptibility."
39532988,Using a behaviour-change approach to support uptake of population genomic screening and management options for breast or prostate cancer.,"As the possibility of implementing population genomic screening programs for the risk of developing hereditary cancers in health systems increases, understanding how to support individuals who wish to have genomic screening is essential. This qualitative study aimed to link public perceived barriers to a) taking up the offer of population genomic screening for breast or prostate cancer risk and b) taking up risk-management options following their result, with possible theory-informed behaviour-change approaches that may support implementation. Ten focus groups were conducted with a total of 25 members of the Australian public to identify and then categorise barriers within the behaviour-change Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour (COM-B) model. Ten COM-B categorised barriers were identified as perceived influences on an individual's intentions to take-up the offer, including Capability (e.g., low public awareness), Opportunity (e.g., inconvenient sample collection procedure) and Motivation (e.g., genomic screening not perceived as relevant to an individual). Ten barriers for taking up risk-management options included Motivation (e.g., concerns about adverse health impact) and Opportunity (e.g., social opportunity and cost incurred to the individual). Our findings demonstrate that a nuanced approach is required to support people to take-up the offer of population genomic screening and, where appropriate, to adopt risk-management options. Even amongst participants who were enthusiastic about a population genomic screening program, needs were varied, demanding a range of implementation strategies. Promulgating equitable uptake of genomic screening and management options for breast and prostate cancer risk will require a needs-based approach."
39528680,Analysis for type of 53BP1 nuclear expression by immunofluorescence as an indicator of genomic instability in oropharyngeal squamous epithelial lesions.,"A subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is caused by the high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV), which expresses p16(INK4a) immunoreactivity. Dual-color immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of TP53 binding protein-1 (53BP1) and a proliferative indicator, Ki-67, to elucidate genomic instability (GIN) in tumor tissues revealed that abnormal 53BP1 expression is closely associated with carcinogenesis in diverse organs. We have previously demonstrated that the number of 53BP1 nuclear foci (NF) in cervical cells increases with cancer progression. The distribution of 53BP1 NF was similar to that of punctate HPV signals, as determined by in situ hybridization, and the pattern of p16(INK4a) overexpression. The present study aimed to confirm the type of 53BP1 expression using dual-color IF as an indicator of GIN in oropharyngeal squamous epithelial lesions, including HPV-dependent and -independent OPSCC. This study identified significant differences in the nuclear expression of 53BP1 between benign oropharyngeal epithelial lesions and OPSCC, and between HPV-dependent and HPV-independent OPSCC. We concluded that the incidence of abnormal 53BP1 expression in OPSCC is significantly associated with stage classification and overall survival. Therefore, double IF analysis of 53BP1 and Ki-67 expression may be a useful tool for estimating the malignant potential and prognosis of OPSCC."
39527943,Validation of a Urine-Based Proteomics Test to Predict Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: Complementing mpMRI Pathway.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men. A major clinical need is to accurately predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa). A proteomics-based 19-biomarker model (19-BM) was previously developed using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and validated in close to 1,000 patients at risk for PCa. This study aimed to validate 19-BM in a multicenter prospective cohort of 101 biopsy-naive patients using current diagnostic pathways. METHODS: Urine samples from 101 patients with suspicious of PCa were analyzed using CE-MS. All patients underwent multiparametric or magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using a 3-T system. The 19-BM score was estimated using support vector machine-based software (MosaCluster v1.7.0), employing the previously published cut-off criterion of -0.07. Diagnostic nomograms were investigated along with mpMRI. RESULTS: Independent validation of 19-BM yielded a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 85% (AUC:0.81). This performance surpassed those of prostate-specific antigen (PSA; AUC:0.56) and PSA density (AUC:0.69). For PI-RADS</= 3 patients, 19-BM showed a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 88%. Integrating 19-BM with mpMRI resulted in significantly better accuracy (AUC:0.90) compared to individual investigations alone (AUC19BM = 0.81; p = 0.004 and AUCmpMRI: 0.79; p = 0.001). Examining the decision curve analysis, 19-BM with mpMRI surpassed other approaches for the prevailing risk interval from a 30% cut-off. CONCLUSIONS: 19-BM exhibited favorable reproducibility for the prediction of csPCa. In patients with PI-RADS </=3, 19-BM correctly classified 88% of the patients with insignificant PCa at the cost of 1 missed csPCa patient. Utilizing the 19-BM test could prove valuable in complementing mpMRI and reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies."
39527247,"Coexistence of complete intestinal tract, prostatic tissue, prostatic urethra and bladder structure in ovarian mature cystic teratoma: a case report.","Mature cystic teratomas (MCTs) of the ovary comprise tissues from all three germ layers. The coexistence of the complete intestinal tract, prostatic tissue, and bladder component within the same ovarian MCT is unprecedented. Here, we report the diagnosis and management of such a rare case. A 26-year-old woman presented with a right ovarian mass, which was later confirmed as an MCT by histopathological examination. The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic cystectomy with no evidence of malignancy or postoperative complications. Histological examination revealed that this MCT contained the complete organ structures including a lower intestinal tract and male genital tract with prostate, urethra, and bladder components, which is unusual. This case underscores the importance of understanding the pathogenesis of extensive organogenesis in MCTs and raises questions about the differentiation processes leading to such unique presentations."
39526457,Pan-Cancer Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Divergent Expression of Embryonic Proangiogenesis Gene Modules in Tumorigenesis.,"BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is indispensable for the sustained survival and progression of both embryonic development and tumorigenesis. This intricate process is tightly regulated by a multitude of pro-angiogenic genes. The presence of gene modules facilitating angiogenesis has been substantiated in both embryonic development and the context of tumor proliferation. However, it remains unresolved whether the pro-angiogenic gene modules expressed during embryonic development also exist in tumors. METHODS: This study performed a pan-cancer single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on samples from 332 patients across seven cancer types: thyroid carcinoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Data processing was carried out using the Seurat R package, with rigorous quality control to filter high-quality cells and mitigate batch effects across datasets. We used principal component analysis (PCA), shared nearest neighbor graph-based clustering, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize cell types and identify distinct cell clusters. Myeloid cell subpopulations were further analyzed for the expression of embryonic pro-angiogenic gene modules (EPGM) and tumor pro-angiogenic gene modules (TPGM). RESULTS: The analysis identified nine major cell types within the tumor microenvironment, with myeloid cells consistently exhibiting elevated expression of both tumor pro-angiogenic gene modules (TPGM) and EPGM across all tumor types. In particular, myeloid cells, including macrophages and monocytes, showed high EPGM expression, indicating an active role of embryonic pro-angiogenesis pathways in tumors. A subset analysis revealed 20 distinct myeloid subtypes with varying EPGM and TPGM expression across different cancers. Treatment and disease stage influenced these gene expressions, with certain subtypes, such as HSPAhi/STAT1+ macrophages in breast cancer, displaying reduced pro-angiogenic gene activity post-treatment. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that tumors may exploit EPGM to enhance vascularization and support sustained growth, as evidenced by the elevated EPGM expression in tumor-associated myeloid cells. The consistent presence of EPGM in TAMs across multiple cancer types suggests a conserved mechanism wherein tumors harness embryonic angiogenic pathways to facilitate their progression. Distinct EPGM expression patterns in specific myeloid cell subsets indicate potential therapeutic targets, particularly in cases where EPGM activation contributes to resistance against anti-angiogenic therapies. These findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor angiogenesis and highlight the prognostic relevance of EPGM expression in cancer, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for clinical applications."
39524226,Characterizing adipocytokine-related signatures for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent malignant tumor in males, with a significant incidence of biochemical recurrence (BCR) despite advancements in treatment. Adipose tissue surrounding the prostate, known as periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), contributes to PCa invasion through adipocytokine production. However, the relationship between adipocytokine-related genes and PCa prognosis remains understudied. This study was conducted to provide a theoretical basis and serve as a reference for the use of adipocytokine-related genes as prognostic markers in PCa. METHODS: Transcriptome and survival data of PCa patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq2 and limma packages. Prognostic genes were identified through univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. A prognostic model was developed and validated utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves. Assessments of immune cell infiltration and drug sensitivity were also carried out. Subsequently, the function of BNIP3L gene in PCa was verified. RESULTS: A total of 47 adipocytokine-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Five genes (PPARGC1A, APOE, BNIP3L, STEAP4, and C1QTNF3) were selected as prognostic markers. The prognostic model demonstrated significant predictive accuracy in both training and validation cohorts. Patients with higher risk scores exhibited poorer survival outcomes. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that the high-risk group had increased immune and ESTIMATE scores, while the low-risk group had higher tumor purity. In vitro experiments confirmed the suppressive effects of BNIP3L on PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. CONCLUSION: The prognostic model independently predicts the survival of patients with PCa, aiding in prognostic prediction and therapeutic efficacy. It expands the study of adipocytokine-related genes in PCa, presenting novel targets for treatment."
39520096,A Narrative Review of the Putative Etiologic Role and Diagnostic Utility of the Cervicovaginal Microbiome in Human Papillomavirus-Associated Cervical Carcinogenesis.,"The cervicovaginal microbiome (CVM) may contribute to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinogenesis. We summarized the literature on the CVM in cervical carcinogenesis by searching Medline, Web of Science, and Embase for articles that sequenced the CVM using metagenomics. Additionally, we identified studies assessing the diagnostic role of the CVM in cervical carcinogenesis by searching PubMed. We performed an environmental scan of Google and Google Scholar to review common CVM characterization techniques. Twenty-eight records presented or summarized associations between the CVM and HPV acquisition, prevalence, persistence, clearance, and cervical lesions or cancer, while three studies identified bacterial taxa detecting high-risk HPV prevalence or cervical lesions. The area under the curve ranged from 0.802 to 0.952. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and whole metagenome sequencing have sufficient resolution to study the CVM bacteriome. Bacterial communities may have important implications in cervical cancer; however, there is a need for methodological standardization for CVM characterization."
39519507,"Using Genetics to Assess the Role of Acetate in Ischemic Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Sex-Hormone-Related Cancers: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","BACKGROUND: Acetate, a short-chain fatty acid, has gained attention for its contrasting roles, with evidence suggesting it may offer cardiovascular protection but also promote cancer, particularly those involving sex hormones. However, these influences have been scarcely assessed in epidemiological research. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between acetate and ischemic heart disease (IHD), diabetes, and cancers related to sex hormones. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to assess potential causal effects, selecting genetic variants without linkage disequilibrium (r(2) < 0.001) and with genome-wide significance for acetate (p < 5 x 10(-8)). These variants were applied to large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for ischemic heart disease (IHD; up to 154,373 cases), diabetes (109,731 cases), and five sex-hormone-related cancers (breast, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, ranging from 8679 to 122,977 cases). We employed various methods for analysis, including penalized inverse variance weighting (pIVW), inverse variance weighting, weighted mode, and weighted median. RESULTS: This study indicates that acetate may be associated with a lower risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD), with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.62 per standard deviation (SD) increase in acetate and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.39 to 0.98. Additionally, acetate was linked to a higher breast cancer risk, with an OR of 1.26 and a 95% CI ranging from 1.08 to 1.46. This association remained robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Acetate, along with factors that influence its activity, may serve as possible targets for breast cancer treatment and possibly IHD, offering opportunities for new drug development."
39518137,Deciphering CD59: Unveiling Its Role in Immune Microenvironment and Prognostic Significance.,"BACKGROUND: CD59, a GPI-anchored membrane protein, protects cancer cells from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by inhibiting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). It has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in most solid tumors, where it facilitates tumor cell escape from complement surveillance. The role of CD59 in cancer growth and interactions between CD59 and immune cells that modulate immune evasion has not been well explored. METHODS: Using cancer patient database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other public databases, we analyzed CD59 expression, its prognostic significance, and its association with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, identifying associated genomic and functional networks and validating findings with invitro cell-line experimental data. RESULTS: This article describes the abundant expression of CD59 in multiple tumors such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), as well as in pan-cancer, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and confirmed using multiple cancer cell lines. The expression of CD59 significantly alters the overall survival (OS) of patients with multiple malignancies such as CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD. Further, the correlation between CD59 and Treg and/or MDSC in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has shown to be strongly associated with poor outcomes in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD as these tumors express high FOXP3 compared to KIRC. Moreover, unfavorable outcomes were strongly associated with the expression of CD59 and M2 tumor-associated macrophage infiltration in the TME via the IL10/pSTAT3 pathway in CESC and GBM but not in KIRC. In addition, TGFbeta1-dominant cancers such as CESC, GBM, and HNSC showed a high correlation between CD59 and TGFbeta1, leading to suppression of cytotoxic T cell activity. CONCLUSION: Overall, the correlation between CD59 and immune cells predicts its prognosis as unfavorable in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD while being favorable in KIRC."
39518119,Characteristics of Cancer in Subjects Carrying Lynch Syndrome-Associated Gene Variants in Taiwanese Population: A Hospital-Based Study in Taiwan.,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased risks of colorectal and endometrial cancers. LS is defined by pathogenic variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, including MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. Data on the prevalence and associated cancer risks of LS in the Han Chinese population remain limited. In this study, using a broad biobank approach through the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative (TPMI), we identified LS-associated MMR gene variants within a cohort of 42,828 participants from a Taiwanese medical center. A total of 89 individuals were found to carry pathogenic MMR variants: MLH1 (n = 22, 25%), MSH2 (n = 47, 53%), and MSH6 (n = 20, 22%). The overall prevalence of MMR variants was calculated, and cancer incidence rates among carriers were determined. The prevalence of MMR variants in the study population was 1 in 481. The distribution of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 variants were 24.7%, 52.8%, and 22.5%, respectively. Cumulative cancer incidence rates of carriers were 40.9% for MLH1 carriers, 29.8% for MSH2, and 40% for MSH6. Among the 19 individuals who underwent colonoscopy screening, the prevalence of polyps was similar to that of the control group (adenoma detection rate: 32% vs 26%, p = 0.585). A meticulous analysis of the detected polyps in seven participants, considering factors such as location, size, morphology, and pathological features, showed no significant differences from controls. A significant cancer risk is associated with LS-related MMR variants in the Taiwanese population. The apparent under diagnosis of LS highlights the urgent need for enhanced surveillance and genetic counseling in this demographic. Our findings suggest that adjustments in the current screening protocols may be warranted to better identify and manage at-risk individuals."
39516438,Development of a prediction model for clinically-relevant fatigue: a multi-cancer approach.,"PURPOSE: Fatigue is the most prevalent symptom across cancer types. To support clinicians in providing fatigue-related supportive care, this study aims to develop and compare models predicting clinically relevant fatigue (CRF) occurring between two and three years after diagnosis, and to assess the validity of the best-performing model across diverse cancer populations. METHODS: Patients with non-metastatic bladder, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, or prostate cancer who completed a questionnaire within three months after diagnosis and a subsequent questionnaire between two and three years thereafter, were included. Predictor variables included clinical, socio-demographic, and patient-reported variables. The outcome was CRF (EORTC QLQC30 fatigue >/= 39). Logistic regression using LASSO selection was compared to more advanced Machine Learning (ML) based models, including Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Internal-external cross-validation was conducted on the best-performing model. RESULTS: 3160 patients were included. The logistic regression model had the highest C-statistic (0.77) and balanced accuracy (0.65), both indicating good discrimination between patients with and without CRF. However, sensitivity was low across all models (0.22-0.37). Following internal-external validation, performance across cancer types was consistent (C-statistics 0.73-0.82). CONCLUSION: Although the models' discrimination was good, the low balanced accuracy and poor calibration in the presence of CRF indicates a relatively high likelihood of underdiagnosis of future CRF. Yet, the clinical applicability of the model remains uncertain. The logistic regression performed better than the ML-based models and was robust across cohorts, suggesting an advantage of simpler models to predict CRF."
39516321,Genomic profiling and clinical utility of circulating tumor DNA in metastatic prostate cancer: SCRUM-Japan MONSTAR SCREEN project.,"BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing has emerged as a novel tool for cancer precision medicine. This study investigated the genomic profiling and clinical utility of ctDNA in metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: This is a nation-wide prospective observational study. Patients treated with systemic treatment for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were included. ctDNA was analyzed using FoundationOne Liquid(R)CDx at enrollment. In a subset of patients, ctDNA after disease progression and tissue prior to the initiation of treatment were examined using FoundationOne Liquid(R)CDx and FoundationOne(R)CDx, respectively. RESULTS: The frequency of AR alterations and homologous recombination repair (HRR) defect was higher in mCRPC compared with mCSPC. Tumor mutational burden was correlated between tissue and ctDNA at pre-treatment, as well as ctDNA between at pre-treatment and at post-treatment. Patients with HRR defect were associated with shorter time to castration resistance in androgen deprivation therapy/combined androgen blockade, but not in androgen receptor pathway inhibitor, compared with patients without HRR defect in mCSPC. Time to treatment failure in patients with AR amplification or AR mutation was shorter compared with patients without AR alterations in mCRPC. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed valuable findings for the clinical care of metastatic prostate cancer. Especially, predictive factors such as HRR defect in mCSPC should be validated in the future."
39513948,Randomized Phase II Study of Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: PD-L1 is overexpressed by dendritic cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing on androgen receptor pathway inhibitors. We tested whether checkpoint blockade could enhance antitumor activity in mCRPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter open-label noncomparative randomized phase II study, patients with mCRPC treated with </=1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, with measurable disease and progression on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, were randomized to durvalumab 1,500 mg intravenously every 4 weeks +/-4 doses of tremelimumab 75 mg intravenously. The primary endpoint was objective response (OR) by iRECIST using a Simon two-stage design. Correlative testing included PD-L1/cluster designation 8 IHC on baseline tumor biopsies and deep targeted sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 70 years (range, 50-83 years), and 52% had prior taxane therapy for mCRPC. In stage I, 13 patients were randomized to durvalumab with no OR observed. Durvalumab + tremelimumab advanced to stage II with 39 patients enrolled (receiving a median three cycles, range 1-53). Durvalumab + tremelimumab-related adverse events were mainly </= grade 2 but led to discontinuation in seven patients. There were seven ORs [19.4% (95% confidence interval: 8.2%-36.0%); intention to treat 17.9% (95% confidence interval: 7.5%-33.5%)]. Five responding tumors were PD-L1-positive and two exhibited DNA damage repair defects. Responses were observed without high tumor mutational burden or other genomic indices of immunotherapy sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab + tremelimumab is active in mCRPC, but patient selection remains a challenge. Further studies to develop predictive biomarkers are warranted."
39513209,"Evaluating different samples & techniques for hr-HPV DNA genotyping to improve the efficiency of risk profiling for oral & cervical cancers in Sikkim, India.","Background & objectives Oral and genital HPV infection in men may be a source of cervical diseases in their women partners as well as disease in themselves. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) in physician-collected cervical samples and qPCR in self-collected urine and oral gargle samples of women and men, respectively, for hr-HPV infection status and genotyping. Methods One thousand and two hundred biological samples were collected from 200 women (urine, oral gargle, and cervical smear) and 200 men (urine and oral gargle) visiting a referral hospital in the remote Himalayan State of Sikkim. The extracted genomic DNA from urine and gargle samples were profiled for hr-HPV genotypes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and HC2 for cervical samples. Results In women, hr-HPV was detected in 17.5 per cent of cervical samples by HC2, 25.5 per cent of urine, and 7 per cent of gargle samples by qPCR. For men, hr-HPV was detected in 8 per cent urine and 5 per cent gargle samples by qPCR. Among the HPV-positive women, 56 per cent of urine samples and 20 per cent of oral samples showed single-genotype infection, while the remaining had multiple genotypes. Amongst the HPV-positive men, 62.7 per cent of urine samples and 85.7 per cent of oral samples showed single-genotype infection while the remaining had multiple genotypes. Compared to Pap, the area under ROC was good for HC2 (AUC=0.89) and for qPCR (AUC= 0.852). Interpretation & conclusions HC2 for cervical and qPCR-based HPV DNA assay for urine and gargle sample is suitable for risk profiling for cervical cancer (CC) and oral cancer (OC) screening programmes."
39513110,The lower incidence of cervical cancer in type 2 diabetes mellitus with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors utilization.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are medications with anti-inflammatory effects used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Cervical cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and is characterized by elevated inflammatory status. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the potential association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and cervical cancer development. In this retrospective cohort study, female patients with T2DM were divided into 2 groups: SGLT2 inhibitor users and a control group of non-SGLT2 inhibitor users. After propensity score matching, the SGLT2 inhibitor group and control group each had 136 212 patients. Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted to obtain the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for cervical cancer between the 2 groups. Overall, 148 and 191 cases of cervical cancer were identified in the SGLT2 inhibitor and control groups, respectively. The incidence of cervical cancer was significantly lower in the SGLT2 inhibitor group than in the control group (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.96, P = 0.0179). In a subgroup analysis stratified by type of oral medication, the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cervical cancer development exhibited a significant difference compared with a biguanide group (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95) and a sulfonylurea group (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.94) groups. In conclusion, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM is associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer development."
39512820,Long non-coding RNAs: regulators of autophagy and potential biomarkers in therapy resistance and urological cancers.,"The non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise a large part of human genome that mainly do not code for proteins. Although ncRNAs were first believed to be non-functional, the more investigations highlighted tthe possibility of ncRNAs in controlling vital biological processes. The length of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exceeds 200 nucleotidesand can be present in nucleus and cytoplasm. LncRNAs do not translate to proteins and they have been implicated in the regulation of tumorigenesis. On the other hand, One way cells die is by a process called autophagy, which breaks down proteins and other components in the cytoplasm., while the aberrant activation of autophagy allegedly involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. The autophagy exerts anti-cancer activity in pre-cancerous lesions, while it has oncogenic function in advanced stages of cancers. The current overview focuses on the connection between lncRNAs and autophagy in urological cancers is discussed. Notably, one possible role for lncRNAs is as diagnostic and prognostic variablesin urological cancers. The proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis and therapy response in prostate, bladder and renal cancers are regulated by lncRNAs. The changes in autophagy levels can also influence the apoptosis, proliferation and therapy response in urological tumors. Since lncRNAs have modulatory functions, they can affect autophagy mechanism to determine progression of urological cancers."
39512605,"Vagus nerve stimulation: Novel concept for the treatment of glioblastoma and solid cancers by cytokine (interleukin-6) reduction, attenuating the SASP, enhancing tumor immunity.","Immuno-oncology, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized cancer care with dramatic, long-term responses and increased survival, including patients with metastatic cancer to the brain. Glioblastomas, and other primary brain tumors, are refractory to ICIs as monotherapy or in combination with standard therapy. The tumor microenvironment (TME) poses multiple biological hurdles: blood-brain barrier, immune suppression, heterogeneity, and tumor infiltration. Genomic analysis of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and preclinical models of glioma suggest that an exciting approach would entail reprogramming of the glioma microenvironment, attenuating the pro-inflammatory, pro-tumorigenic cytokines of the SASP, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6). A testable hypothesis now proposed is to modulate the immune system by harnessing the body's 'inflammatory reflex' to reduce cytokines. Vagus nerve stimulation can activate T cell immunity by the cholinergic, alpha7nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (alpha7nAchR), and suppress IL-6 systemically, as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines of the SASP, interleukin -1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The hypothesis predicts that electrical activation of the vagus nerve, with cytokine reduction, in combination with ICIs, would convert an immune resistant (""cold"") tumor to an immune responsive (""hot"") tumor, and halt glioma progression. The hypothesis also envisions cancer as an immune ""dysautonomia"" whereby a therapeutic intervention, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), resets the systemic and local cytokine levels. A prospective, randomized, phase II clinical trial, to confirm the hypothesis, is a logical, exigent, next step. Cytokine reduction by VNS could also be useful for other forms of human cancer, e.g., breast, colorectal, head and neck, lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, as the emerging field of ""cancer neuroscience"" shows a role for neural regulation of multiple tumor types. Because IL-6, and companion pro-inflammatory cytokines, participate in the initiation, progression, spread and recurrence of cancer, minimally invasive VNS could be employed to suppress glioma or cancer progression, while also mitigating depression and/or seizures, thereby enhancing quality of life. The current hypothesis reimagines glioma pathophysiology as a dysautonomia with the therapeutic objective to reset the autonomic nervous system and form an immune responsive state to halt tumor progression and prevent recurrence. VNS, as a novel method to control cancer, can be administered with ICIs, standard therapy, or in clinical trials, combined with emerging immunotherapy: dendritic cell, mRNA, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell vaccines."
39511540,Targeting LLT1 as a potential immunotherapy option for cancer patients non-responsive to existing checkpoint therapies in multiple solid tumors.,"BACKGROUND: High levels of LLT1 expression have been found in several cancers, where it interacts with CD161 on NK cells to facilitate tumor immune escape. Targeting LLT1 could potentially relieve this inhibitory signal and enhance anti-tumor responses mediated through NK cells. Using the 'The Cancer Genome Atlas' (TCGA) database, we investigated the role of LLT1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) across various cancers. Identifying such biomarkers could create new therapeutic options for patients in addition to complementing existing immunotherapies. METHODS: LLT1 expression was evaluated in 33 cancers using TCGA transcriptome data. Univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to assess the correlation of LLT1 expression with patient survival. The relationship between LLT1 expression with immune infiltrates, immune gene signatures, and cancer genomic biomarkers (TMB, MSI, and MMR) was also investigated. Immunofluorescence studies were conducted to validate LLT1 expression in tumors. Furthermore, using the CRI iAtlas data, we evaluated LLT1 distribution and its correlation with other immune checkpoint genes in patients non-responsive to existing immune checkpoint therapies across multiple solid cancers. RESULTS: High expression of LLT1 was observed in 12 cancers, including BRCA, CHOL, ESCA, GBM, HNSC, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, LUAD, STAD, SARC, and PCPG. In certain cancers like COAD, KICH, and KIRC, high LLT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Further analysis revealed that upregulated LLT1 was associated with an abundance of NK and T cell infiltrates in the TME, as well as exhaustive immune biomarkers, and inversely associated with pro-inflammatory and tumor suppressor signatures. High LLT1 expression is also positively correlated with genomic biomarkers in certain cancers. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed moderate to high LLT1 expression in immune-resistant prostate cancer, glioma, ovarian cancer, and immune-sensitive liver cancer cell lines. An independent assessment of clinical cohorts from CRI iAtlas showed a correlation of upregulated LLT1 with multiple immunosuppressive genes in patients non-responsive to current ICIs. CONCLUSIONS: The biomarker analysis revealed a clear association between elevated LLT1 expression and an immunosuppressive TME in patient cohorts from TCGA and clinical databases. Therefore, this study provides a foundation for utilizing LLT1 as a potential target to improve clinical responses in ICI non-responsive patients with upregulated LLT1."
39511287,Spatial transcriptomics reveals strong association between SFRP4 and extracellular matrix remodeling in prostate cancer.,"Prostate tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle when studying the biological mechanisms of molecular markers. Increased gene expression levels of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a biomarker in aggressive prostate cancer. To understand how SFRP4 relates to prostate cancer we performed comprehensive spatial and multiomics analysis of the same prostate cancer tissue samples. The experimental workflow included spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, proteomics, DNA methylomics and tissue staining. SFRP4 mRNA was predominantly located in cancer stroma, produced by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and co-expressed with extracellular matrix components. We also confirmed that higher SFRP4 gene expression is associated with cancer aggressiveness. Gene expression of SFRP4 was affected by gene promotor methylation. Surprisingly, the high mRNA levels did not reflect SFRP4 protein levels, which was much lower. This study contributes previously unknown insights of SFRP4 mRNA in the prostate tumor environment that potentially can improve diagnosis and treatment."
39510199,Determining the effect of long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA MEG3) on the transcriptome profile in cervical cancer cell lines.,"This study investigates the role of the long non-coding RNA Maternally Expressed Gene3 (lncRNA MEG3) gene in cervical cancer, as evidenced by its downregulation in cancerous cell lines. The study demonstrates the effects of the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3 in cervical cancer cell lines, particularly in C33A and CaSki. Through comprehensive analyses, including Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), alterations in global mRNA expression were analyzed. In C33A cells, 67 genes were upregulated, while 303 genes were downregulated. Similarly, in CaSki cells, 221 genes showed upregulation and 248 genes displayed downregulation. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were conducted to gain insight into potential mechanisms. Furthermore, the study delves into gene regulatory networks, uncovering intricate interactions among genes. The RNA sequencing data were confirmed for eight genes: PAX3, EGR2, ROR1, NRP1, OAS2, STRA6, CA9, and EDN2 by Real-time PCR. The findings illuminate the complex landscape of gene expression alterations and pathways impacted by the overexpression of lncRNA MEG3. The impact of MEG3 on the overall cervical cancer cells' mRNA profile is reported for the first time. New biomarkers for the prognosis of cervical cancer are also reported in this study. Moreover, identifying specific genes within the regulatory networks provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing cervical cancer."
39510141,Validation of an artificial intelligence-based prognostic biomarker in patients with oligometastatic Castration-Sensitive prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for clinically actionable prognostic and predictive tools to guide the management of oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC). METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study to assess the prognostic and predictive performance of a multimodal artificial intelligence biomarker (MMAI; the ArteraAI Prostate Test) in men with omCSPC (n = 222). The cohort also included 51 patients from the STOMP and ORIOLE phase 2 clinical trials which randomized patients to observation versus metastasis-directed therapy (MDT). MMAI scores were computed from digitized histopathology slides and clinical variables. Overall survival (OS) and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC) were assessed for the entire cohort from time of diagnosis. Metastasis free survival (MFS) was assessed for the trial cohort from time of randomization. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, patients with a high MMAI score had significantly worse OS (HR = 6.46, 95 % CI = 1.44-28.9; p = 0.01) and shorter TTCRPC (HR = 2.07, 95 % CI = 1.15-3.72; p = 0.015). In a multivariable Cox model, MMAI score remained the only variable significantly associated with OS (HR = 6.51, 95 % CI = 1.32-32.2; p = 0.02). In the subset of patients randomized in the STOMP and ORIOLE trials, high MMAI score corresponded to improved MFS with MDT (p = 0.039) compared to patients with a low score, with p(interaction) = 0.04. CONCLUSION: The ArteraAI MMAI biomarker is prognostic for OS and TTCRPC among patients with omCSPC and may predict for response to MDT. Further work is needed to validate the MMAI biomarker in a broader mCSPC cohort."
39508435,Discovery of CHD1 Antagonists for PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.,"CHD1 is a chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding protein that preferentially recognizes di- and trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2/3). Genetic studies have established CHD1 as a synthetic lethal target in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-deficient cancers. Despite this attractive therapeutic link, no inhibitors or antagonists of CHD1 have been reported to date. Herein, we report the discovery of UNC10142, a first-in-class small molecule antagonist of the tandem chromodomains of CHD1 that binds with an IC(50) of 1.7 +/- 0.2 muM. A cocrystal structure revealed a unique binding mode and competition pull-down experiments in cell lysates confirmed endogenous target engagement. Treatment of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells with UNC10142 led to a dose-dependent reduction in viability while PTEN-intact prostate cancer cells were unaffected, phenocopying genetic loss of CHD1. Overall, this study demonstrates the ligandability of the CHD1 chromodomains and suggests more potent and selective antagonists could translate to compounds of therapeutic value in PTEN-deficient cancers."
39507757,Establishment of a clinical cancer genetics program for breast cancer in a resource-limited country; challenges and opportunities.,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and its incidence rate is still increasing, especially among younger women. Nationally, it constitutes one-fifth of all cancer cases and almost 40% of all female cancers. With a median age of 51 years, breast cancer is diagnosed at least a decade earlier, and at more advanced stages compared to Western societies. Hereditary cancers account for 10% or more of all cancer burden worldwide. With expanded indications, increased number of genes tested, and significant decline in cost of testing, such proportion will probably increase. Individuals with pathogenic variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are at higher risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic and many other cancers. Over the past two decades, several highly penetrant cancer-susceptibility genes were identified across almost all tumor sites, thus increasing the need for comprehensive cancer genetic programs that address the testing process, counselling patients and at-risk family members, and then deal with all testing results and its consequences. In addition to its important role in preventing more cancers in index patients themselves and among their close relatives, identification of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, mostly in BRCA1 or BRCA2, may inform therapeutic decisions in common cancers including breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. In this manuscript, we describe the experience of a comprehensive cancer center, in a resource-limited country in establishing a comprehensive clinical cancer genetics program that can serve as an example for others who share similar demographic and financial restrains."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oversight fell under the VA Office of Research Development (VA ORD) and DOE headquarters. An Executive Committee and 2 senior scientific liaisons work with VA and DOE leadership to optimize efforts in the service of shared scientific goals. The program supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including creation of a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes. Cross-cutting methods including natural language processing, image processing, and reusable code were developed. RESULTS: The 79.6 million dollar collaboration has supported centralized data management and genomic analysis including a scalable approach to cataloging phenotypes and launched over 10 collaborative scientific projects in health conditions highly prevalent in veterans. A ground-breaking analysis on the Summit and Andes supercomputers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) of the genetic underpinnings of over 2000 health conditions across 44 million genetic variants which resulted in the identification of 38 270 independent genetic variants associating with one or more health traits. Of these, over 2000 identified associations were unique to non-European ancestry. Cross-cutting methods have advanced state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) including large language natural language processing and a system biology study focused on opioid addiction awarded the 2018 Gordon Bell Prize for outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. The collaboration has completed work in prostate cancer, suicide prevention, and cardiovascular disease, and cross-cutting data science. Predictive models developed in these projects are being tested for application in clinical management. DISCUSSION: Eight new projects were launched in 2023, taking advantage of the momentum generated by the previous collaboration. A major challenge has been limitations in the scope of appropriated funds at DOE which cannot currently be used for health research. CONCLUSION: Extensive multidisciplinary interactions take time to establish and are essential to continued progress. New funding models for maintaining high-performance computing infrastructure at the ORNL and for supporting continued collaboration by joint VA-DOE research teams are needed."
39506116,Automated real-world data integration improves cancer outcome prediction.,"The digitization of health records and growing availability of tumour DNA sequencing provide an opportunity to study the determinants of cancer outcomes with unprecedented richness. Patient data are often stored in unstructured text and siloed datasets. Here we combine natural language processing annotations(1,2) with structured medication, patient-reported demographic, tumour registry and tumour genomic data from 24,950 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to generate a clinicogenomic, harmonized oncologic real-world dataset (MSK-CHORD). MSK-CHORD includes data for non-small-cell lung (n = 7,809), breast (n = 5,368), colorectal (n = 5,543), prostate (n = 3,211) and pancreatic (n = 3,109) cancers and enables discovery of clinicogenomic relationships not apparent in smaller datasets. Leveraging MSK-CHORD to train machine learning models to predict overall survival, we find that models including features derived from natural language processing, such as sites of disease, outperform those based on genomic data or stage alone as tested by cross-validation and an external, multi-institution dataset. By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of automated annotation from unstructured notes and its utility in predicting patient outcomes. The resulting data are provided as a public resource for real-world oncologic research."
39506094,A novel approach to engineering three-dimensional bladder tumor models for drug testing.,"Bladder cancer (BCa) poses a significant health challenge, particularly affecting men with higher incidence and mortality rates. Addressing the need for improved predictive models in BCa treatment, this study introduces an innovative 3D in vitro patient-derived bladder cancer tumor model, utilizing decellularized pig bladders as scaffolds. Traditional 2D cell cultures, insufficient in replicating tumor microenvironments, have driven the development of sophisticated 3D models. The study successfully achieved pig bladder decellularization through multiple cycles of immersion in salt solutions, resulting in notable macroscopic and histological changes. This process confirmed the removal of cellular components while preserving the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Quantitative analysis demonstrated the efficacy of decellularization, with a remarkable reduction in DNA concentration, signifying the removal of over 95% of cellular material. In the development of the in vitro bladder cancer model, muscle invasive bladder cancer patients' cells were cultured within decellularized pig bladders, yielding a three-dimensional cancer model. Optimal results were attained using an air-liquid interface technique, with cells injected directly into the scaffold at three distinct time points. Histological evaluations showcased characteristics resembling in vivo tumors derived from bladder cancer patients' cells. To demonstrate the 3D cancer model's effectiveness as a drug screening platform, the study treated it with Cisplatin (Cis), Gemcitabine (Gem), and a combination of both drugs. Comprehensive cell viability assays and histological analyses illustrated changes in cell survival and proliferation. The model exhibited promising correlations with clinical outcomes, boasting an 83.3% reliability rate in predicting treatment responses. Comparison with traditional 2D cultures and spheroids underscored the 3D model's superiority in reliability, with an 83.3% predictive capacity compared to 50% for spheroids and 33.3% for 2D culture. Acknowledging limitations, such as the absence of immune and stromal components, the study suggests avenues for future improvements. In conclusion, this innovative 3D bladder cancer model, combining decellularization and patient-derived cells, marks a significant advancement in preclinical drug testing. Its potential for predicting treatment outcomes and capturing patient-specific responses opens new avenues for personalized medicine in bladder cancer therapeutics. Future refinements and validations with larger patient cohorts hold promise for revolutionizing BCa research and treatment strategies."
39505858,A PSA SNP associates with cellular function and clinical outcome in men with prostate cancer.,"Genetic variation at the 19q13.3 KLK locus is linked with prostate cancer susceptibility in men. The non-synonymous KLK3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17632542 (c.536 T > C; Ile163Thr-substitution in PSA) is associated with reduced prostate cancer risk, however, the functional relevance is unknown. Here, we identify that the SNP variant-induced change in PSA biochemical activity mediates prostate cancer pathogenesis. The 'Thr' PSA variant leads to small subcutaneous tumours, supporting reduced prostate cancer risk. However, 'Thr' PSA also displays higher metastatic potential with pronounced osteolytic activity in an experimental metastasis in-vivo model. Biochemical characterisation of this PSA variant demonstrates markedly reduced proteolytic activity that correlates with differences in in-vivo tumour burden. The SNP is associated with increased risk for aggressive disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality in three independent cohorts, highlighting its critical function in mediating metastasis. Carriers of this SNP allele have reduced serum total PSA and a higher free/total PSA ratio that could contribute to late biopsy decisions and delay in diagnosis. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the prominent 19q13.3 KLK locus, rs17632542 SNP, association with a spectrum of prostate cancer clinical outcomes."
39505744,NEK2 is a potential pan-cancer biomarker and immunotherapy target.,"BACKGROUND: NEK2 is a member of the NEKs family and plays an important role in cell mitosis. Increasing evidence suggests that NEK2 is associated with the development of multiple tumors, but systematic studies of NEK2 in cancer are still lacking. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic value of NEK2 in 33 cancers to elucidate the potential function of NEK2 in pan-cancers. METHODS: We investigated the role of NEK2 in pan-cancers utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Additionally, we analyzed the association between NEK2 gene expression across various cancers, protein expression, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug sensitivity using several software and web platforms.The potential oncogenic role of NEK2 was initially explored using bioinformatics methods. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro experiments to preliminarily validate the function of NEK2 in cervical cancer. RESULTS: NEK2 is overexpressed in almost all tumors, and mutation of NEK2 are associated with a poorer tumor prognosis. In addition, the correlation between NEK2 and immune features such as immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB), Microsatellite instability(MSI) etc. suggest that NEK2 could potentially be applied in the immunotherapy of tumors. CONCLUSION: NEK2 may be a potential pan-cancer biomarker and immunotherapeutic target for improving the efficacy of tumor therapy."
39505505,The Current Status of Comprehensive Genomic Profiling in the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Study from a Cooperative Hospital for Cancer Genomic Medicine in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: Several effective treatment modalities against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are available; however, an unmet clinical need persists for mCRPC treatment because resistance to these therapies is inevitable. This study aimed to evaluate the status of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) and its impact on subsequent treatments for patients with mCRPC at our hospital. METHODS: Between December 2020 and August 2023, we assessed 41 patients with mCRPC who underwent CGP testing at the Nippon Medical School Hospital. The testing comprised FoundationOne((R)) CDx for 30 patients and FoundationOne((R)) Liquid CDx for 11 patients, following the procedures outlined by the Japanese Urological Association. RESULTS: CGP testing was successfully conducted in 40 out of 41 patients (97.6%), which resulted in the identification of 140 actionable genomic alterations. The most common alteration was TP53 in 12 patients (30.0%). Twenty-three patients (57.5%) with druggable gene alterations were identified; 21 were recommended for clinical trials, four for patient-proposed healthcare services, and six for insurance-covered drugs. Consequently, genotype-matched therapy with insurance-covered drugs was administered to five patients (12.5%) with a BRCA2 mutation. Notably, none of the patients underwent clinical or prospective trials based on patient-suggested medical services. CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer insights into the real-world application of CGP testing for patients with mCRPC at a cooperative hospital for cancer genomic medicine in Japan. Thus, urologists require a comprehensive understanding of the current status of CGP testing to enhance mCRPC management."
39502170,Alternative splicing in the genome of HPV and its regulation.,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. These chronic infections are characterized by high expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes and the absence of the L1 and L2 capsid proteins. The regulation of HPV gene expression plays a crucial role in both the viral life cycle and rare oncogenic events. Alternative splicing of HPV mRNA is a key mechanism in post-transcriptional regulation. Through alternative splicing, HPV mRNA is diversified into various splice isoforms with distinct coding potentials, encoding multiple proteins and influencing the expression of HPV genes. The spliced mRNAs derived from a donor splicing site within the E6 ORF and one of the different acceptor sites located in the early mRNA contain E6 truncated mRNAs, named E6*. E6* is one of the extensively studied splicing isoforms. However, the role of E6* proteins in cancer progression remains controversial. Here, we reviewed and compared the alternative splicing events occurring in the genomes of HR-HPV and LR-HPV. Recently, new HPV alternative splicing regulatory proteins have been continuously discovered, and we have updated the regulation of HPV alternative splicing. In addition, we summarized the functions of known splice isoforms from three aspects: anti-tumorigenic, tumorigenic, and other cancer-related functions, including not only E6*, but also E6;E7, E8;E2, and so on. Comprehending their contributions to cancer development enhances insights into the carcinogenic mechanisms of HPV and explores the potential utility of alternative splicing in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer."
39502104,"Prognostic Expression Signature of RB1, PTEN, and TP53 Genes in Patients with Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.","Alterations in the tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) RB1, PTEN, and TP53 are associated with treatment resistance, worse survival, and aggressive variants of prostate cancer (AVPC). We previously developed and validated a signature reflecting low TSG expression (TSG(low)) that was associated with poor outcomes in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) +/- docetaxel. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to validate the TSG(low) signature in patients with mHSPC treated with ADT and an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) and to explore clinical characteristics at progression according to TSG status. TSG mRNA expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples was assessed via nCounter. Correlation of expression levels with castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-FS; primary endpoint) and overall survival (OS) was investigated via Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox analyses. Of the 137 patients included, 77.4% had de novo stage IV cancer and 44.5% had high-risk disease. TSG(low) (16.8%) was correlated with visceral metastases (p = 0.013), high-risk disease (p = 0.038), higher Gleason score (p = 0.026), shorter CRPC-FS (hazard ratio 1.9; p = 0.046) and higher AVPC frequency (p = 0.01). Our results confirm that a TSG(low) signature is an adverse prognostic factor and is associated with AVPC development in patients with mHSPC treated with ADT + ARPI. Further prospective validation is needed to define specific therapeutic strategies for these patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We looked at outcomes for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with hormone therapies. We found that patients with low expression of two out of three tumor suppressor genes (TP53, RB1, PTEN) had worse clinical outcomes and had aggressive variants of prostate cancer. Measuring the expression of these genes in early-stage prostate cancer could help in finding better treatments for these patients."
39501808,Human-Artificial Intelligence Symbiotic Reporting for Theranostic Cancer Care.,"Reporting of diagnostic nuclear images in clinical cancer management is generally qualitative. Theranostic treatment with (177)Lu radioligands for prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumors is routinely given as the same arbitrary fixed administered activity to every patient. Nuclear oncology, as currently practiced with (177)Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen and (177)Lu peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, cannot, therefore, be characterized as personalized precision medicine. The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) could change this ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to theranostics, through development of a symbiotic relationship with physicians. Combining quantitative data collection, collation, and analytic computing power of AI algorithms with the clinical expertise, empathy, and personal care of patients by their physician envisions a new paradigm in theranostic reporting for molecular imaging and radioligand treatment of cancer. Human-AI interaction will facilitate the compilation of a comprehensive, integrated nuclear medicine report. This holistic report would incorporate radiomics to quantitatively analyze diagnostic digital imaging and prospectively calculate the radiation absorbed dose to tumor and critical normal organs. The therapy activity could then be accurately prescribed to deliver a preordained, effective, tumoricidal radiation absorbed dose to tumor, while minimizing toxicity in the particular patient. Post-therapy quantitative imaging would then validate the actual dose delivered and sequential pre- and post-treatment dosimetry each cycle would allow individual dose prescription and monitoring over the entire course of theranostic treatment. Furthermore, the nuclear medicine report would use AI analysis to predict likely clinical outcome, predicated upon AI definition of tumor molecular biology, pathology, and genomics, correlated with clinical history and laboratory data. Such synergistic comprehensive reporting will enable self-assurance of the nuclear physician who will necessarily be deemed personally responsible and accountable for the theranostic clinical outcome. Paradoxically, AI may thus be expected to enhance the practice of phronesis by the nuclear physician and foster a truly empathic trusting relationship with the cancer patient."
39501423,Commercial prices and their influence on urology practices: Prostate cancer care among men with Medicare.,"BACKGROUND: For men with prostate cancer, there is substantial variation in the use of conservative management, such as active surveillance. Commercial prices, which vary across urology practices, may afford incentives that foster physician behaviors associated with utilization. Such behaviors may ""spillover"" to the Medicare population and affect quality. This study evaluated the effects of practice-level commercial prices on health care utilization and quality in men with prostate cancer insured by traditional Medicare. METHODS: From a 20% Medicare sample, the authors identified men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer between 2014-2019 (n = 44,653). Using commercial payments from the MarketScan database, they developed a practice-level commercial price index (ratio of commercial prices to Medicare prices). They examined the association of the price index with price standardized spending, overtreatment (treatment among those with >50% noncancer mortality within 10 years), and underuse of diagnostic testing in active surveillance (at least one prostate-specific antigen test and one confirmatory test-MRI, prostate biopsy, genomic test-within 12 months of diagnosis). RESULTS: Practice-level commercial price indices varied from 1.34 (134% of Medicare prices), for practices in the bottom decile, to 3.00, for practices in the top decile. Increasing price index was associated with lower odds of overtreatment (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.97; p = .01), but not price standardized spending or underuse of diagnostic testing in active surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial prices vary markedly across urology practices. Among newly diagnosed men with traditional Medicare, those managed by practices with higher commercial price indices had lower odds of overtreatment, suggesting improved prostate cancer care quality."
39499532,"CACHE Challenge #1: Targeting the WDR Domain of LRRK2, A Parkinson's Disease Associated Protein.","The CACHE challenges are a series of prospective benchmarking exercises to evaluate progress in the field of computational hit-finding. Here we report the results of the inaugural CACHE challenge in which 23 computational teams each selected up to 100 commercially available compounds that they predicted would bind to the WDR domain of the Parkinson's disease target LRRK2, a domain with no known ligand and only an apo structure in the PDB. The lack of known binding data and presumably low druggability of the target is a challenge to computational hit finding methods. Of the 1955 molecules predicted by participants in Round 1 of the challenge, 73 were found to bind to LRRK2 in an SPR assay with a K(D) lower than 150 muM. These 73 molecules were advanced to the Round 2 hit expansion phase, where computational teams each selected up to 50 analogs. Binding was observed in two orthogonal assays for seven chemically diverse series, with affinities ranging from 18 to 140 muM. The seven successful computational workflows varied in their screening strategies and techniques. Three used molecular dynamics to produce a conformational ensemble of the targeted site, three included a fragment docking step, three implemented a generative design strategy and five used one or more deep learning steps. CACHE #1 reflects a highly exploratory phase in computational drug design where participants adopted strikingly diverging screening strategies. Machine learning-accelerated methods achieved similar results to brute force (e.g., exhaustive) docking. First-in-class, experimentally confirmed compounds were rare and weakly potent, indicating that recent advances are not sufficient to effectively address challenging targets."
39497187,"The long lost denture: a rare case of an acquired, non-malignant tracheo-oesophageal fistula.","BACKGROUND: Ingested dental prosthesis are susceptible to impaction in the gastrointestinal tract due to their sharp edges, size and contour. Delays in presentation arise from the lack of clear history of ingestion and misdiagnosis occurs due to the radiolucency of denture material on plain radiography. An acquired, non-malignant tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) may develop from a chronically impacted denture. Surgical management of a TOF secondary to denture is a challenging clinical problem that is rarely reported in the literature and no previous case reports have described the two-staged reconstruction approach that we present here. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a male in his early 60s who presented to an acute general hospital with symptoms ongoing for over one year of dysphagia, recurrent chest infections and weight loss. Barium swallow and computed tomography identified an ingested dental prosthesis (denture) that had caused a TOF. He was transferred to our specialist thoracic surgery unit where an attempt to remove the foreign body endoscopically was abandoned due to firm impaction and risk of further injury. The subsequent multi-disciplinary management of this complex case required a two-staged reconstruction approach. The first procedure involved extracting the foreign body, repairing the underlying defects with tracheal resection and anastomosis, and creating an oesophageal diversion with cervical oesophagostomy. The second procedure achieved continuity of the gastrointestinal tract with gastric pull-up and pharyngo-gastric anastomosis. Following rehabilitation, the patient was discharged on oral intake alongside percutaneous jejunostomy feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and removal of impacted dental prosthesis is essential to prevent morbidity and mortality. Delayed diagnosis can lead to acquired TOF with associated consequences such as recurrent pulmonary infection, mediastinitis and nutritional deficit. Challenges we encountered, such as failed attempts at endoscopic retrieval and the difficult dissection of fibrotic tissue, were directly due to the delayed identification of the denture. We highlight the importance of holding a high index of clinical suspicion of foreign body ingestion in dental prosthesis wearers who present with recurrent chest infections and ongoing dysphagia. We also promote the need for a collaborative multi-disciplinary approach in the surgical management of complex cases."
39496938,Role of non-coding RNA in lineage plasticity of prostate cancer.,"The treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) has made great progress in recent years, but treatment resistance always develops and can even lead to fatal disease. Exploring the mechanism of drug resistance is of great significance for improving treatment outcomes and developing biomarkers with predictive value. It is increasingly recognized that mechanism of drug resistance in advanced PCa is related to lineage plasticity and tissue differentiation. Specifically, one of the mechanisms by which castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells acquire drug resistance and transform into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) cells is lineage plasticity. NEPC is a subtype of PCa that is highly aggressive and lethal, with a median survival of only 7 months. With the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing technology, more and more non-coding RNAs have been identified, which play important roles in different diseases through different mechanisms. Several ncRNAs have shown great potential in PCa lineage plasticity and as biomarkers. In the review, the role of ncRNA in PCa lineage plasticity and its use as biomarkers were reviewed."
39494345,The role of NOP58 in prostate cancer progression through SUMOylation regulation and drug response.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in men. Its molecular pathogenesis is closely linked to various genetic and epigenetic alterations, including posttranslational modifications like SUMOylation. Identifying biomarkers that predict outcomes and specific therapeutic targets depends on a comprehensive understanding of these processes. With growing interest in SUMOylation as a mechanism affecting prostate cancer-related genes, this study aimed to investigate the central role of SUMOylation in prostate cancer prognostics, focusing on the significance of NOP58. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, integrating differential expression analysis, survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and single-cell transcriptomic analyses using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Key genes were identified through intersections of Venn diagrams, Boralta algorithm signatures, and machine learning models. These signaling mechanisms were validated through experimental studies, including immunohistochemical staining and gene ontology analyses. RESULTS: The dual-gene molecular subtype analysis with SUMO1, SUMO2, and XPO1 genes revealed significant differences in survival outcomes across molecular subtypes, further emphasizing the potential impact of NOP58 on SUMOylation, a key post-translational modification, in prostate cancer. NOP58 overexpression was strongly associated with shorter overall survival (OS), progression-free interval (PFI), and disease-specific death in prostate cancer patients. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that NOP58 was significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that NOP58 could distinguish prostate cancer from control samples with high diagnostic accuracy. Gene Ontology analysis, along with GSVA and GSEA, suggested that NOP58 may be involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair pathways. Moreover, NOP58 knockdown led to increased BCL2 expression and decreased Ki67 levels, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. Colony formation assays further showed that NOP58 knockdown inhibited, while its overexpression promoted, colony formation, highlighting the critical role of NOP58 in prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Additionally, NOP58 was linked to drug responses, including Methotrexate, Rapamycin, Sorafenib, and Vorinostat. CONCLUSION: NOP58 is a key regulator of prostate cancer progression through its mediation of the SUMOylation pathway. Its expression level serves as a reliable prognostic biomarker and an actionable therapeutic target, advancing precision medicine for prostate cancer. Targeting NOP58 may enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve outcomes in oncology."
39491920,X-LDA: An interpretable and knowledge-informed heterogeneous graph learning framework for LncRNA-disease association prediction.,"The identification of disease-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is beneficial to unravel the intricacies of gene expression regulation and epigenetic signatures. Computational methods provide a cost-effective means to explore lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs). However, these methods often lack interpretability, leaving their predictions less convincing to biological and medical researchers. We propose an interpretable and knowledge-informed heterogeneous graph learning framework based on graph patch convolution and integrated gradients to predict LDAs and provides intuitive explanations for its predictions, called X-LDA. The heterogeneous graph is the foundation of the predictions of LDAs, we construct the knowledge-informed heterogeneous graph including LDAs drawn from biological experiments, lncRNA similarities rooted in gene sequences, disease similarities constructed based on disease categorizations. To integrate diverse biological premises and facilitate interpretability, we define nine distinct graph patch types, which encapsulate essential topological relationships within lncRNA-disease node pairs. X-LDA is designed to employ parameter sharing and multi-convolution kernels to grasp common and multiple perspectives of the graph patches, respectively. This approach culminates in the fusion of various semantic information into context embeddings. These post-hoc explanations hinge on graph patch features and integrated gradients, shedding light on the underlying factors driving predictions. Cross validation experiment on the dataset curated from databases and literatures demonstrates that the superior performance of X-LDA in comparison to nine state-of-the-art methods of three categories. X-LDA achieves a larger average area under the receiver operating curve 0.9891 (by at least 6.68%), and a larger average area under the precision-recall curve 0.7907 (by at least 23.2%) than competitive methods. The results of our well-designed ablation and interpretability experiments and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis demonstrate X-LDA's robustness, learnability, predictability, and interpretability. The applicability of X-LDA is also demonstrated through a case study involving the investigation of associated lncRNAs in prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer."
39490531,Identification of m(6)A-related lncRNAs prognostic signature for predicting immunotherapy response in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: N6-methylandenosine-related long non-coding RNAs (m(6)A-related lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the cancer progression and immunotherapeutic efficacy. The potential function of m(6)A-related lncRNAs signature in cervical cancer has not been systematically clarified. METHODS: RNA-seq and the clinical data of cervical cancer were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas. All of the patients were randomly classified into training and testing cohorts. The m(6)A-related lncRNAs prognostic model was constructed by LASSO regression using data in the training cohort.The predictive value of the signature was validated in the whole cohort and testing cohort. Cervical cancer patients were divided into low- and high-risk subgroups by the median value of risk scores. Kaplan-Meier analysis, principal-component analysis (PCA), functional enrichment annotation, and nomogram were used for further evaluation. We also examined the immune response and potential drug sensitivity targeting this model. RESULTS: Seventy-nine prognostic m(6)A-related lncRNAs were screened. The risk model comprising four m(6)A-related lncRNAs (AL139035.1, AC015922.2, AC073529.1, AC008124.1) was identified and verified as an independent prognostic predictor of cervical cancer. A nomogram based on age, tumor grade, clinical stage, TNM stage, and four m(6)A-related lncRNAs risk signatures was generated. It displayed good accuracy and reliability in predicting the overall survival of patients with CC. Based on our risk model, cervical cancer patients with potential immunotherapy benefits from the candidate drugs could be effectively screened. CONCLUSION: The four m(6)A-related lncRNAs signature may provide new targets and allow the prediction of immunotherapy response, which can assist developing individualized treatment for cervical cancer."
39489778,Decoding the epigenetics and chromatin loop dynamics of androgen receptor-mediated transcription.,"Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription plays a critical role in development and prostate cancer growth. AR drives gene expression by binding to thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) that loop to hundreds of target promoters. With multiple CREs interacting with a single promoter, it remains unclear how individual AR bound CREs contribute to gene expression. To characterize the involvement of these CREs, we investigate the AR-driven epigenetic and chromosomal chromatin looping changes by generating a kinetic multi-omic dataset comprised of steady-state mRNA, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, histone modifications, chromatin looping, and nascent RNA. Using an integrated regulatory network, we find that AR binding induces sequential changes in the epigenetic features at CREs, independent of gene expression. Further, we show that binding of AR does not result in a substantial rewiring of chromatin loops, but instead increases the contact frequency of pre-existing loops to target promoters. Our results show that gene expression strongly correlates to the changes in contact frequency. We then propose and experimentally validate an unbalanced multi-enhancer model where the impact on gene expression of AR-bound enhancers is heterogeneous, and is proportional to their contact frequency with target gene promoters. Overall, these findings provide insights into AR-mediated gene expression upon acute androgen simulation and develop a mechanistic framework to investigate nuclear receptor mediated perturbations."
39487222,Iroquois homeobox 4 (IRX4) derived micropeptide promotes prostate cancer progression and chemoresistance through Wnt signalling dysregulation.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a commonly diagnosed cancer. Genome-wide association studies have implicated Iroquois homeobox 4 (IRX4) in PCa susceptibility, yet its functional roles remain unclear. We discovered a 78-amino acid micropeptide (miPEP, IRX4_PEP1), encoded from the alternative start site within the IRX4 gene. The miPEPs, encoded through short open reading frames (sORFs) have emerged as regulators of diverse biological processes. However, the significance of miPEPs in prostate tumorigenesis and therapy response remains unexplored to date. Here, we demonstrated the unique role of IRX4_PEP1 in PCa. METHODS: The role of IRX4_PEP1 was evaluated in PCa in vitro via functional assays and comprehensive pathway analysis. The interacting partners of IRX4_PEP1 were identified using an immunoprecipitation assay, and the impact of IRX4_PEP1 on PCa stem cells was assessed through a stem cell enrichment assay. Additionally, the expression of IRX4_PEP1 was evaluated in PCa patient samples for its potential diagnostic and prognostic significance. RESULTS: Here we show IRX4_PEP1 promotes PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK). Notably, IRX4_PEP1 dysregulates Wnt signalling by interacting with Catenin beta 1 (beta catenin; CTNB1), elevating PCa stemness markers, and fostering docetaxel resistance. Clinically, IRX4_PEP1 expression is elevated in PCa tissues and correlates positively with disease aggressiveness. CTNNB1, HNRNPK levels, and ssGSEA enrichment score of WNT/CTNB1 signalling correlate positively with IRX4_PEP1 in PCa tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight IRX4_PEP1 role in PCa stemness and chemoresistance, suggesting it as a therapeutic target and potential diagnostic marker."
39484437,Understanding the development of enzalutamide resistance based on a functional single-cell approach.,"Most metastatic prostate cancers (PCa) initially depend on androgen for survival and proliferation. Thus, anti-androgen or castration therapies are the mainstay treatment. Although effective at first, androgen-dependent PCa (ADPC) universally develops therapy resistance, thereby evolving to the incurable disease, called castration resistant PCa (CRPC). Currently, mechanisms underlying the emergence of CRPC from ADPC are largely unclear. We used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to determine how a therapy-naive ADPC cell line - LNCaP responds to the anti-androgen drug, enzalutamide. We found that most cells expressed the drug-target androgen receptor (AR+), while a small subpopulation ( approximately 12%) expressed low or no AR (AR (low/-) ). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that AR+ and AR (low/-) cells were enriched with significantly different gene expressions and signaling pathways. Unexpectedly, AR (low/-) cells displayed robust transcriptional response, including upregulations of genes and pathways involved in clinical CRPC. Next, we isolate AR (low/-) and AR+ cells from the LNCaP cell line, and functionally confirmed the enzalutamide resistant phenotype of AR (low/-) cells in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Finally, to explore a therapeutic option for AR (low/-) cells, we found that AR (low/-) cells expressed low levels of NAD+ biosynthesis genes, notably NAPRT, indicating a possible vulnerability to inhibitors blocking NAD+ synthesis. Indeed, treating AR (low/-) cells with NAD+ synthesis inhibitors, FK866 and OT-82, significantly inhibited the survival and proliferation of AR (low/-) cells, thus suggesting a possible novel therapeutic option for ADT and enzalutamide resistant PCa. SUMMARY: Single-cell RNA-Sequencing reveals heterogeneities of tumor cell populations. In most cases, however, the functional significance of the observed heterogeneity is not tested. In this study, we first identified a possible therapy-resistant prostate cancer cell subpopulation with scRNA-Seq, then confirmed the resistant phenotype with single cell and colony - based cloning and functional testing. In addition, we also identified a therapeutic vulnerability of the resistant cells."
39483945,Metallophosphoesterase-Domain-Containing Protein 2 (MPPED2) Expression in High-Risk Human Papilloma Virus-Induced Cervical Carcinoma and Its Correlation With p16INK4A Protein.,"Introduction Recently, the expression of metallophosphoesterase-domain-containing protein 2 (MPPED2) was identified in cervical cancer. However, its precise role and correlation with other tumor suppressor proteins, such as p16INK4A, is not well studied in high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) integrated human cervical carcinoma. Hence, in the present study, we try to see the expression of MPPED2 in human cervical carcinoma and its correlation with age and p16INK4A protein expression level. Methods The prospective study consists of 200 samples of 150 known cervical carcinoma and 50 controls. Histopathological evaluation, immunohistochemical staining, and semi-quantitative scoring of the intensity of proteins were performed. Statistical analysis was performed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, Spearman's rho correlation sig. (two-tailed), and Student's t-test. Results The data show that among the 150 cases, 136 (68.0%) cervical carcinoma tissues express the presence of high-risk HPV viral genome integration in the host cell. The expression of p16INK4A protein is higher in those tissues identified with high-risk HPV viral genomes. In contrast, the expression of MPPED2 protein is lesser or absent in those cervical tissues that have the higher expression of p16INK4A protein and vice versa. There is a significant correlation (p=0.000) between age and p16INK4A protein expression but not with MPPED2. A significant linear correlation (p=0.000) is found between the p16INK4A and MPPED2 proteins. Conclusion It may support the therapeutic application of MPPED2 protein to prevent cervical carcinoma progression in the near future."
39483900,Polyploid cancer cells reveal signatures of chemotherapy resistance.,"Therapeutic resistance in cancer significantly contributes to mortality, with many patients eventually experiencing recurrence after initial treatment responses. Recent studies have identified therapy-resistant large polyploid cancer cells in patient tissues, particularly in late-stage prostate cancer, linking them to advanced disease and relapse. Here, we analyzed bone marrow aspirates from 44 advanced prostate cancer patients and found the presence of CTC-IGC was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival. Single cell copy number profiling of CTC-IGC displayed clonal origins with typical CTCs, suggesting complete polyploidization. Induced polyploid cancer cells from PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with docetaxel or cisplatin were examined through single cell DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and protein immunofluorescence. Novel RNA and protein markers, including HOMER1, TNFRSF9, and LRP1, were identified as linked to chemotherapy resistance. These markers were also present in a subset of patient CTCs and associated with recurrence in public gene expression data. This study highlights the prognostic significance of large polyploid tumor cells, their role in chemotherapy resistance, and their expression of markers tied to cancer relapse, offering new potential avenues for therapeutic development."
39484518,"Oncogenic Alterations, Race, and Survival in US Veterans with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Undergoing Somatic Tumor Next Generation Sequencing.","PURPOSE: National guidelines recommend next generation sequencing (NGS) of tumors in patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) to identify potential actionable alterations. We sought to describe the spectrum and frequency of alterations in PCa-related genes and pathways, as well as associations with self-identified race/ethnicity, and overall survival in US Veterans. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Non-Hispanic white (NHW) Veterans with mPCa who obtained NGS through the Veterans Affairs National Precision Oncology Program. 45 genes in seven canonical or targetable mPCa pathways were evaluated in addition to TMB and MSI status. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and genomic alteration frequencies. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between race/ethnicity, specific gene/pathway alteration, and overall survival. RESULTS: 5,015 Veterans with mPCa who had NGS conducted were included (1,784 NHB, 3,231 NHW). NHB Veterans were younger, had higher PSA at diagnosis, were less likely to report Agent Orange exposure, and resided in more deprived neighborhoods compared to NHW Veterans. Nine of the top ten most commonly altered genes were the same in NHB v NHW Veterans; however, the frequencies of alterations varied by race/ethnicity. NHB race/ethnicity was associated with higher odds of genomic alterations in SPOP (OR 1.7 [1.2-2.6]) as well as immunotherapy targets (OR 1.7 [1.1-2.7]) including MSI high status (OR 3.1 [1.1-9.4]). Furthermore, NHB race/ethnicity was significantly associated with lower odds of genomic alterations in the AKT/PI3K pathway (OR 0.6 [0.4-0.7]), AR axis (OR 0.7 [0.5-0.9]), and tumor suppressor genes (OR 0.7 [0.5-0.8]). Cox proportional hazards modelling stratified by race/ethnicity demonstrated alterations in tumor suppressor genes including TP53 were associated with shorter OS in both NHB (HR 1.54 [1.13-2.11] and NHW individuals (HR 1.52 [1.25-1.85]). CONCLUSION: In the equal access VA healthcare setting, Veterans undergoing NGS for mPCa exhibited differences in alteration frequencies in both actionable and non-actionable pathways that may be associated with survival. This analysis affirms the utility of genomic testing for identifying candidates irrespective of race/ethnicity for precision oncology treatments, which could contribute to equitable outcomes in patients with mPCa."
39487104,Ac(3)4deoGlcNAz: A Selective Probe for Identifying O-GlcNAc-Modified Proteins in Prostate Cancer.,"GlcNAcylation is a prevalent protein modification in eukaryotic cells and increasing evidences indicated that over-expressed O-GlcNAcylation are intimately linked to the development and prognosis of prostate cancer. Thus, exploring this modification in the context of prostate cancer is vital for understanding the underlying mechanisms and hopefully used for future targeted therapies. In this paper, we use our previously established metabolic probes to comprehensively compare the labeling efficiency of O-GlcNAc modified proteins in PC3 cells. Our results demonstrated that all the tested probes were non-toxic to PC3 cells and only Ac(4)GlcNAz, Ac(4)GalNAz and Ac(3)4deoGlcNAz exhibited robust labeling signals amongst the probes. Further investigations by western blot and flow cytometry analysis revealed that Ac(3)4deoGlcNAz was a specific and efficient probe for intracelluar protein labeling with negligible S-glyco-modification signal. In addition, proteomic analysis further confirmed that 94 % of the proteins identified by Ac(3)4deoGlcNAz were in the form of O-linked GlcNAc rather than S-glyco-modification, these enriched O-GlcNAcylated proteins were mainly involved in the regulated processes of prostate cancer. Our results here together prove Ac(3)4deoGlcNAz is a safe and reliable probe for metabolic labeling O-GlcNAc modified proteins in prostate cancer, providing a mean to fully exploit the regulatory mechanism of O-GlcNAcylation in the process of prostate cancer."
39485597,Prospective study of the real impact of fusion centered genomic assays in patient management in a national collaborative group: the GETHI-XX-16 study.,"PURPOSE: Precision medicine represents a paradigm shift in oncology. Access to genetic testing and targeted therapies is frequently limited. Assays based on DNA sequencing can miss druggable alterations. We aimed to determine the impact of a free access program to RNA tests in patient management. METHODS: We designed a multicenter prospective observational study within the Spanish National Group for Translational Oncology and Rare and Orphan Tumors (GETTHI). Eligible patients were adults with solid cancers that had progressed on standard therapies. Tumor samples were analyzed using two RNA sequencing assays (Trailblaze Pharos(TM) and Archer FusionPlex Solid Tumor(TM)). A central committee evaluated the actionability of genetic alterations and reported the findings to attending physicians, who made the final clinical management decisions. RESULTS: Between November 2016 and April 2019, 395 patients with 41 different tumors across 30 hospitals were included. Molecular analysis revealed actionable genetic alterations in 57 individuals (14.4%). Targeted therapies were advised for 23 and seven received a matched targeted therapy: two lung cancers (EML4-ALK and CD74-ROS1 fusion), three glioblastomas (EGFR point mutations), one oligodendroglioma (FGFR3-TACC3 fusion) and a prostate cancer (SND1-BRAF fusion). The outcomes included two tumor responses, one disease stabilization, one early withdrawal due to toxicity, one progression, and one unknown. CONCLUSION: Despite the growing knowledge of cancer biology and its translation to drug development, the overall impact of personalized treatments remains low. Access to comprehensive molecular tests covering properly all known actionable alterations and programs for a wide access to targeted therapies seem to be critical steps."
39482144,Germline genetic testing for prostate cancer: Ordering trends in the era of expanded hereditary cancer screening recommendations.,"PURPOSE: The availability of targeted therapies for advanced prostate cancer led to the expansion of national guidelines recommending germline genetic testing. The aim of this study was to describe recent trends in germline test ordering patterns for patients with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of patients with prostate cancer who underwent germline testing through a single commercial laboratory (Invitae Corporation) between 2015-2020 was performed. Ordering trends between provider medical specialties were compared. Our primary hypothesis was that the proportion of tests ordered by urologists would increase over time. RESULTS: In total, 17,256 prostate cancer patients underwent germline genetic testing; 14,400 patients had an ordering provider with an associated medical specialty and were included in the final comparison cohort. Total prostate cancer patients undergoing germline testing increased quarterly from 21 in Q2 of 2015 to 1,509 in Q3 of 2020. The proportion of tests ordered by urologists increased from 0% in Q2 2015 to 8.3% in Q3 2020 (P < 0.001). Compared to medical genetics, medical oncology, and other specialties, urology ordered more tests for patients under 70 years old (66% vs 51%-55%, P <0.004) and for patients who reported negative family history (25% vs 12%-20%, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: As awareness and indications for germline testing continue to expand, aggregate ordering volume is increasing, and urologists are becoming more involved in facilitating testing. This highlights the continued importance of educating urologists on the indications for and implications of germline genetic testing, as well as providing tools to support implementation."
39478176,Inferring allele-specific copy number aberrations and tumor phylogeography from spatially resolved transcriptomics.,"Analyzing somatic evolution within a tumor over time and across space is a key challenge in cancer research. Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) measures gene expression at thousands of spatial locations in a tumor, but does not directly reveal genomic aberrations. We introduce CalicoST, an algorithm to simultaneously infer allele-specific copy number aberrations (CNAs) and reconstruct spatial tumor evolution, or phylogeography, from SRT data. CalicoST identifies important classes of CNAs-including copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity and mirrored subclonal CNAs-that are invisible to total copy number analysis. Using nine patients' data from the Human Tumor Atlas Network, CalicoST achieves an average accuracy of 86%, approximately 21% higher than existing methods. CalicoST reconstructs a tumor phylogeography in three-dimensional space for two patients with multiple adjacent slices. CalicoST analysis of multiple SRT slices from a cancerous prostate organ reveals mirrored subclonal CNAs on the two sides of the prostate, forming a bifurcating phylogeography in both genetic and physical space."
39477439,"Genetic Variations in TP53, RB1, and PTEN in a Selected Sample of Slovak Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.","BACKGROUND/AIM: This report aimed to present identified variants with pathogenic potential in three genes - TP53, PTEN, and RB1 - in a selected sample of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with or without the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and splice variant AR-V7. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Next generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina platform to analyse the genetic profiles of 50 patients with mCRPC. Identified variants were validated using the Integrative Genomic Viewer, and the correlation between these variants and the presence of CTC/AR-V7 was subjected to statistical analysis. RESULTS: The study revealed a total of 15 genetic alterations in the three examined genes. The presence of rs1042522 (TP53) in mCRPC patients was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of AR-V7 occurrence (p<0.001), indicating a protective effect. Additionally, patients with AR-V7 showed a marked increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Higher PSA levels were correlated with an increased risk of AR-V7 presence. CONCLUSION: The identified genetic mutations and PSA levels have a moderate predictive ability for determining AR-V7 status."
39477403,"Liquid-based Cytological Features of Adenocarcinoma Not Otherwise Specified, Extrauterine Adenocarcinoma, and Other Malignant Neoplasms of The Uterine Cervix: A 5-year Single-institutional Experience With 30 Consecutive Patients.","BACKGROUND/AIM: The adenocarcinoma (ADC) and other malignant neoplasm (OMN) terminologies of The Bethesda System represent various histological types of uterine and extrauterine malignancies. This study aimed to clarify the incidences of ADC not otherwise specified (ADC-NOS), ADC extrauterine (ADC-EXT), and OMN in our institution and describe their characteristic cytomorphological features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched the database to identify all patients diagnosed with carcinoma, including those diagnosed through cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC), between January 2019 and December 2023. The electronic medical records and all available slides were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, 30 of the 149,197 (0.02%) patients were diagnosed with ADC-NOS, ADC-EXT, and OMN. All three groups included various histological types of both gynecological and non-gynecological origin. More than two-thirds (23/30; 76.7%) were of uterine origin, but seven patients had metastatic carcinoma of extrauterine organ origin, including the ovary, lung, stomach, breast, colon, urethra, and pancreas. In all patients, the cytological features were concordant with the histological features. CONCLUSION: In LBC, ADC-NOS does not only encompass uterine cervical tumors, but also various types of extrauterine malignancies. ADC-EXT and OMN also represent both extrauterine and uterine tumors. Awareness of the morphological features observed in LBC samples of non-gynecological malignancies may be helpful in obtaining the correct diagnosis."
39477401,Clinical Outcomes of Pleomorphic High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions of the Uterine Cervix: A Single-institutional Experience of 44 Cases.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Pleomorphic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (PHSILs) of the uterine cervix are characterized by strikingly pleomorphic and enlarged nuclei with brisk mitotic activity. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical outcomes of patients with PHSIL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records of 44 patients with PHSIL. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 52.1 years. The initial cytological diagnosis was HSIL in 43.2% of patients. High-risk human papillomavirus was detected in 89.5% of patients. The human papillomavirus type was not predominated by one specific type. The patients were treated with conization alone or with conization with subsequent hysterectomy. Two cases of squamous cell carcinoma coexisting with PHSIL, and one case of adenoid basal carcinoma were detected among the surgical specimens. Follow-up cytology revealed negative results for intraepithelial lesions in all patients, except for one patient who experienced recurrent PHSIL 41 months after hysterectomy and underwent laser ablation. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of concurrent squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%) and recurrence (2.3%) in our PHSIL cohort were lower than those previously reported in patients with conventional HSIL. Our findings suggest that pleomorphic nuclear change alone in PHSIL was not associated with worse clinical outcomes than conventional HSIL and support the notion that PHSIL does not require more aggressive clinical management than conventional HSIL. However, close follow-up with cytological examination may be necessary to determine the potential risk of recurrence."
39477315,Comprehensive Clinicopathological and Immunohistochemical Analysis of Human Papillomavirus-independent Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Human papillomavirus-independent (HPVI) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) of the uterine cervix are extremely rare. The aim of this study was to comprehensively describe the clinicopathological features, patient outcomes, and immunophenotypes of HPVI SCC and ASC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We found four and two patients with HPVI SCC and ASC, respectively, and reviewed their electronic medical records and pathology slides. We also performed immunostaining for p16 and p53. RESULTS: All except one patient underwent surgery. Two, one, and one patients with HPVI SCC were diagnosed as having IIIC1, IVA, and IVB diseases, respectively. Two patients with HPVI SCC experienced recurrences, and died of disease within nine months after treatment initiation. Both patients with HPVI ASC developed lung metastasis at four months post-operatively. HPVI SCCs and the squamous component of HPVI ASCs showed keratinizing, condylomatous, or poorly differentiated morphology. The glandular component of HPVI ASCs was gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma. None of the six tumors exhibited block positivity for p16. Two HPVI SCCs and one HPVI ASC displayed aberrant p53 expression. CONCLUSION: HPVI SCC is a rare and aggressive cervical malignancy that presents initially as advanced-stage disease with poor prognosis. Although the patients with initial stage I and II HPVI ASC were treated with curative intent, distant metastases appeared in the lungs during the early course of treatment. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the association between histological features and clinical behavior of HPVI ASC."
39477297,Invasive Stratified Mucin-producing Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix: Comparison of Its Clinicopathological Characteristics and Programmed Death-ligand 1 Expression Status With Those of Other Endocervical Adenocarcinomas.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Invasive stratified mucin-producing carcinoma (ISMC) is a rare but aggressive variant of endocervical adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in clinicopathological features, patient outcomes, and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression among ISMC, usual-type EAC (UEA), and gastric-type EAC (GEA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: PD-L1 22C3 immunostaining was performed using 20 ISMCs, 20 UEAs, and 20 GEAs. Combined positive score (CPS) method was used to assess PD-L1 immunoreactivity. RESULTS: ISMC was diagnosed at a younger age and showed a more advanced stage and shorter survival than UEA. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of ISMC patients were lower than those of UEA but comparable to those of GEA. ISMC type was an independent prognostic factor for predicting short DFS [hazard ratio (HR)=2.790, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.153-6.756] and OS (HR=6.071, 95%CI=1.257-29.327). All ISMCs showed PD-L1 over-expression with a mean CPS of 44.5 (range=10-100), which was higher than those of UEA (mean CPS=8.2) and GEA (mean CPS=6.5). PD-L1 positivity (CPS>/=1) was also an independent prognostic factor for worse OS (HR=2.472, 95%CI=1.097-5.570). Despite PD-L1 over-expression, ISMC patients treated with pembrolizumab showed no clinical response. CONCLUSION: All examined ISMCs over-expressed PD-L1. ISMC showed higher PD-L1 expression than UEA and GEA and worse survival than UEA. PD-L1 over-expression was found to be a significant predictor for worse DFS and OS in patients with ISMC. Our data suggest that PD-L1 over-expression is associated with poor ISMC prognosis."
39474871,Recent advances in basic research on prostate cancer: Where we are heading?,"In the over 80 years since androgens were found to play a pivotal role in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a cornerstone in treating advanced PCa. Castration-resistant PCa persists, however, with some of these tumors evolving to androgen receptor (AR)-independent forms like neuroendocrine PCa. The development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to PCa is therefore crucial. This review provides an overview of recent basic research in PCa, focusing on two main areas: PCa cells and their tumor microenvironments. The first section describes current knowledge on the intricate mechanisms of AR signaling pathways, emphasizing the roles of coactivators and chromatin state alterations in gene regulation. Genomic analyses have revealed recurrent mutations and copy number alterations critical for precision medicine. Liquid biopsy has become a promising tool for real-time tumor monitoring, identifying genetic alterations in circulating-tumor DNA or extracellular vesicles. The second section describes the tumor microenvironment of PCa, highlighting its immunosuppressive landscape and the potential of combining ADT with immunotherapy. Advanced techniques, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics offer insights into cellular heterogeneity and interactions within the tumor microenvironment, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. Integration of these diverse research areas will provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions of PCa research, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine and the dynamic nature of cancer treatment strategies."
39474781,Altered immunophenotypic expression in the peripheral bladder cancer immune landscape.,"Treatments targeting the immune system only benefit a subset of patients with bladder cancer (BC). Biomarkers predictive of BC progression and response to specific therapeutic interventions are required. We evaluated whether peripheral blood immune subsets and expression of clinically relevant immune checkpoint markers are associated with clinicopathologic features of BC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from blood collected from 23 patients with BC and 9 age-matched unaffected-by-cancer control donors were assessed using a 21-parameter flow cytometry panel composed of markers of T, B, natural killer and myeloid populations and immune checkpoint markers. Patients with BC had significantly lower numbers of circulating CD19(+) B cells and elevated circulating CD4(+)CD8(+) T cells compared with the control cohort. Immune checkpoint markers programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) were elevated in the total peripheral immune cell population in patients with BC. Within the BC cohort, PD-1 expression in T and myeloid cells was elevated in muscle-invasive compared with non-muscle-invasive disease. In addition, elevated T, B and myeloid PD-1 cell surface expression was significantly associated with tumor stage, suggesting that measures of peripheral immune cell exhaustion may be a predictor of tumor progression in BC. Finally, positive correlations between expression levels of the various immune checkpoints both overall and within key peripheral blood immune subsets collected from patients with BC were observed, highlighting likely coregulation of peripheral immune checkpoint expression. The peripheral blood immunophenotype in patients with BC is altered compared with cancer-free individuals. Understanding this dysregulated immune profile will contribute to the identification of diagnostic and prognostic indicators to guide effective immune-targeted, personalized treatments."
39473410,Mechanistic Insights and Molecular Diagnostics of TMPRSS2-ERG: Overview of the Journey from Regulation of Signaling Landscape in Fusion Positive Prostate Cancer to Appraisal as a Diagnostic Marker.,"Chromosomal rearrangements and recurrent gene fusions were previously presumed to be the primary oncogenic mechanisms of hematological malignancies. However, the discovery of gene fusions in different cancers has opened new horizons to comprehensively investigate how cell type-specific fusion oncoproteins modulate signaling cascades. Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifaceted and therapeutically challenging disease, and functional genomics have helped us develop a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying prostate carcinogenesis, castration-resistant PCa, and metastasis. Keeping in mind the fact that gene fusions have also been discovered in PCa, there has been rapid expansion in the field of molecular oncology and researchers are uncovering new facets regarding the mechanistic regulation of signaling pathways by fusion oncoproteins."
39472694,Gene-based burden tests of rare germline variants identify six cancer susceptibility genes.,"Discovery of cancer risk variants in the sequence of the germline genome can shed light on carcinogenesis. Here we describe gene burden association analyses, aggregating rare missense and loss of function variants, at 22 cancer sites, including 130,991 cancer cases and 733,486 controls from Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom. We identified four genes associated with increased cancer risk; the pro-apoptotic BIK for prostate cancer, the autophagy involved ATG12 for colorectal cancer, TG for thyroid cancer and CMTR2 for both lung cancer and cutaneous melanoma. Further, we found genes with rare variants that associate with decreased risk of cancer; AURKB for any cancer, irrespective of site, and PPP1R15A for breast cancer, suggesting that inhibition of PPP1R15A may be a preventive strategy for breast cancer. Our findings pinpoint several new cancer risk genes and emphasize autophagy, apoptosis and cell stress response as a focus point for developing new therapeutics."
39472583,Integrative spatial and genomic analysis of tumor heterogeneity with Tumoroscope.,"Spatial and genomic heterogeneity of tumors are crucial factors influencing cancer progression, treatment, and survival. However, a technology for direct mapping the clones in the tumor tissue based on somatic point mutations is lacking. Here, we propose Tumoroscope, the first probabilistic model that accurately infers cancer clones and their localization in close to single-cell resolution by integrating pathological images, whole exome sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics data. In contrast to previous methods, Tumoroscope explicitly addresses the problem of deconvoluting the proportions of clones in spatial transcriptomics spots. Applied to a reference prostate cancer dataset and a newly generated breast cancer dataset, Tumoroscope reveals spatial patterns of clone colocalization and mutual exclusion in sub-areas of the tumor tissue. We further infer clone-specific gene expression levels and the most highly expressed genes for each clone. In summary, Tumoroscope enables an integrated study of the spatial, genomic, and phenotypic organization of tumors."
39472282,"Proteomic Analysis of Microsomal Proteins Reveals That MVP Is Crucial for the Secretion of GDF-15, Which in Turn Promotes the Neuroendocrine Differentiation of PCa Cells.","Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive androgen-independent PCa (AIPC) that tends to resist treatment. Understanding its progression and resistance could improve survival outcomes. Previous studies on PCa cells highlighted microsomal proteins' role in PCa progression, but their role in the progression of NEPC remains unclear. Thus, we investigated microsomal proteins in in vitro differentiated NE-LNCaP cells and their role in NED of PCa. Microsomal proteomics revealed two cancer-associated proteins GDF-15 and MVP as elevated in NE-LNCaP cells with GDF-15 among the top 5 upregulated proteins. MVP is elevated in NE-LNCaP and is also increased in NCI-H660 microsomes compared to LNCaP. GO and protein network analysis showed that different molecular networks are affected by microsomal protein enrichment, and MVP and GDF-15 are mapped to functional subnetworks associated with cancer. Remarkably, GDF-15 and MVP are essential for LNCaP cell differentiation when stimulated with Forskolin. Interestingly, AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in NE-LNCaP and NCI-H660 cells with the direct involvement of GDF-15. In summary, we have uncovered that GDF-15 and MVP are involved in NED, with MVP being essential for GDF-15 secretion, promoting NED in PCa cells. These findings provide insights into NED mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for NEPC."
39471423,Clinical value of comprehensive genomic profiling on clinical trial enrollment for patients with advanced solid tumors.,"The use of biomarker testing to inform treatment decisions has emerged as a standard of care in multiple cancer types. However, the rates of patients with genomic testing results in hand to inform treatment decision-making remain variable. Here, we studied the impact of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) on clinical trial enrollment rates in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer using a real-world clinicogenomic database. On average, clinical trial enrollment in the therapy line immediately after CGP report receipt was 5.4%, which represents a 3.0 percentage point increase compared to therapy lines preceding CGP report receipt, supporting a meaningful association between CGP report availability and increased clinical trial enrollment."
39471411,Deep contrastive learning for predicting cancer prognosis using gene expression values.,"Recent advancements in image classification have demonstrated that contrastive learning (CL) can aid in further learning tasks by acquiring good feature representation from a limited number of data samples. In this paper, we applied CL to tumor transcriptomes and clinical data to learn feature representations in a low-dimensional space. We then utilized these learned features to train a classifier to categorize tumors into a high- or low-risk group of recurrence. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we demonstrated that CL can significantly improve classification accuracy. Specifically, our CL-based classifiers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 for 14 types of cancer, and an AUC greater than 0.9 for 3 types of cancer. We also developed CL-based Cox (CLCox) models for predicting cancer prognosis. Our CLCox models trained with the TCGA data outperformed existing methods significantly in predicting the prognosis of 19 types of cancer under consideration. The performance of CLCox models and CL-based classifiers trained with TCGA lung and prostate cancer data were validated using the data from two independent cohorts. We also show that the CLCox model trained with the whole transcriptome significantly outperforms the Cox model trained with the 16 genes of Oncotype DX that is in clinical use for breast cancer patients. The trained models and the Python codes are publicly accessible and provide a valuable resource that will potentially find clinical applications for many types of cancer."
39470950,Application and new findings of scRNA-seq and ST-seq in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor of the male urological system with the highest incidence rate in the world, which seriously threatens the life and health of middle-aged and elderly men. The progression of prostate cancer involves the interaction between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of prostate cancer pathogenesis and disease progression is important to guide diagnosis and therapy. The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptome sequencing (ST-seq) technologies has brought breakthroughs in the study of prostate cancer. It makes up for the defects of traditional techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting that are difficult to elucidate cell-specific gene expression. This review summarized the heterogeneity and functional changes of prostate cancer and tumor microenvironment revealed by scRNA-seq and ST-seq, aims to provide a reference for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer."
39469880,"A Comprehensive Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein UCP2, with a Focus on Sex and Gender-Related Aspects.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a crucial role in regulating oxidative stress and cellular metabolism, positioning it as an important subject in oncological research. The involvement of UCP2 in cancer is complex and context-dependent, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we aimed to perform a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of UCP2, with a particular focus on gender-related malignancies such as breast (BRCA), prostate (PRAD), ovarian (OV), and testicular tumors (TGCT). METHODS: We analyzed UCP2 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), examining correlations with prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, genes involved in steroidogenesis, sex hormone receptor genes, and drug sensitivity. RESULTS: Significant variability in UCP2 expression was observed across cancer types. UCP2 levels were elevated in BRCA and OV but reduced in PRAD and TGCT. High UCP2 expression was associated with a better prognosis in OV and poorer overall survival in PRAD. Furthermore, UCP2 correlated with TMB and MSI in OV, TGCT, and BRCA. UCP2 expression was also linked to immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, steroidogenic genes, and sex hormone receptor genes, with variable effects depending on cancer type and gender. Additionally, UCP2 also demonstrated sensitivity to specific anticancer drugs. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the interplay between UCP2, immune and hormonal pathways, and drug response and reveal potential opportunities for new therapeutic combinations, especially in gender-related cancers."
39465910,Comprehensive Analysis of Codon Usage Bias in Human Papillomavirus Type 51.,"Human papillomavirus type 51 (HPV-51) is associated with various cancers, including cervical cancer. Examining the codon usage bias of the organism can offer valuable insights into its evolutionary patterns and its relationship with the host. This study comprehensively analyzed codon usage bias in HPV-51 by examining 64 complete genome sequences sourced from the NCBI GenBank database. Our analysis revealed no noteworthy preference for codon usage in HPV-51 overall. However, there was a noticeable bias towards A/T-ending codons, accompanied by GC3s below 32%. Dinucleotide frequency analysis revealed reduced frequencies for ApA, CpG, and TpC dinucleotides, while CpA and TpG dinucleotides were more frequent than others. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage analysis revealed 30 favored codons, primarily concluding with A/T nucleotides. Further analysis using Parity Rule 2, Effective Number of Codons plot, and neutrality plot indicated a balance between mutational pressure and natural selection, with natural selection being the primary force shaping codon usage bias. The Isoacceptor tRNA Pool analysis indicates that HPV-51 has a higher translation efficiency within the human cellular translational system. Moreover, the Codon Adaptation Index and Relative Codon Deoptimization Index analyses suggested a moderate adaptation of HPV-51 to human codon preferences. Our discoveries offer valuable perspectives on how HPV-51 evolves and uses genetic codes, contributing to a deeper comprehension of its endurance and disease-causing potential."
39464307,Clinico-Pathological Factors and AR-LBD Mutations in Early and Late Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is not well understood because of its enormous biological heterogeneity and unreliable progression. We conducted this retrospective analysis to examine the variables predicting early and late progression to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) for better management of this disease. METHODS: This single institutional retrospective study was conducted from January 2018 to January 2022. A total of 98 consecutive men meeting with the diagnosis of CRPC as per the inclusion criteria were included in the study and were stratified in four quartiles on the basis of time to CRPC (time to castration resistance [TTCR]) development. Early CRPC (1(st) quartile, TTCR = 6-12 months) and late CRPC (4(th) quartile, TTCR = 38-120 months) were then compared on the basis of different clinical, pathological and AR-LBD sequence to find the correlation with response duration. RESULTS: Median time to develop castration resistance was 25 +/- 26.44 months. The mean age of the patients was 66.8 +/- 9.20 years and median baseline PSA was calculated 100+/-685.06 ng/mL respectively. Higher Gleason score (>/=7-10) was found to be significantly associated with early development of CRPC (p<0.001) and lower nadir PSA was significantly indicating late CRPC progression (p<0.005). No mutations were found in androgen receptor exon-5, 6, 7 except a homozygous mutation in the 7(th) intronic region, which is involved in splice variants formation playing noteworthy role in CRPC development. CONCLUSION: Time for metastatic PCa to CRPC ranges from 6-120 months revealing its heterogeneous nature. Early age presentation in the clinic and high initial PSA and high grade (GS>7) at diagnosis were positively associated with early CRPC while lower nadir PSA was correlated with late CRPC progression. No remarkable genomic mutations were discovered. Therefore, more data are needed and further research is required with large no. of patients to discover the predictive prognostic biomarkers for better patients' management."
39464116,Voluntary Exercise Attenuates Tumor Growth in a Preclinical Model of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To examine the effects of voluntary exercise training on tumor growth and explore the underlying intratumoral molecular pathways and processes responsible for the beneficial effects of VWR on tumor initiation and progression in a mouse model of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). METHODS: Male immunodeficient mice (SCID) were castrated and subcutaneously inoculated with human CWR-22RV1 cancer cells to construct CRPC xenograft model before randomly assigned to either voluntary wheel running (VWR) or sedentary (SED) group (n=6/group). After three weeks, tumor tissues were collected. Tumor size was measured and calculated. mRNA expression of markers of DNA replication, Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics was determined by RT-PCR. Protein expression of mitochondrial content and dynamics was determined by western blotting. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis was performed in the tumor tissues. RESULTS: Voluntary wheel running resulted in smaller tumor volume at the initial stage and attenuated tumor progression throughout the time course (P < 0.05). The reduction of tumor volume in VWR group was coincided with lower mRNA expression of DNA replication markers ( MCM2 , MCM6 , and MCM7 ), AR signaling ( ELOVL5 and FKBP5 ) and regulatory proteins of mitochondrial fission (Drp1 and Fis1) and fusion (MFN1 and OPA1) when compared to the SED group (P<0.05). More importantly, RNA sequencing data further revealed that pathways related to pathways related to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and endothelial cell proliferation were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks of VWR was effective in delaying tumor initiation and progression, which coincided with reduced transcription of DNA replication, AR signaling targets and mitochondrial dynamics. We further identified reduced molecular pathways/processes related to angiogenesis that may be responsible for the delayed tumor initiation and progression by VWR."
39464080,The Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway alters the cytoskeleton to modulate cell proliferation and migration in metastatic prostate cancer.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progresses despite androgen deprivation therapy, as cancer cells adapt to grow without testosterone, becoming more aggressive and prone to metastasis. CRPC biology complicates the development of effective therapies, posing challenges for patient care. Recent gene-expression and metabolomics studies highlight the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) as a critical player, with key components like GNPNAT1 and UAP1 being downregulated in metastatic CRPC. GNPNAT1 knockdown has been shown to increase cell proliferation and metastasis in CRPC cell lines, though the mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the cellular basis of these CRPC phenotypes, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout model of GNPNAT1 in 22Rv1 CRPC cells, analyzing its impact on metabolomic, glycoproteomic, and transcriptomic profiles of cells. We hypothesize that HBP inhibition disrupts the cytoskeleton, altering mitotic progression and promoting uncontrolled growth. GNPNAT1 KO cells showed reduced levels of cytoskeletal filaments, such as actin and microtubules, leading to cell structure disorganization and chromosomal mis-segregation. GNPNAT1 inhibition also activated PI3K/AKT signaling, promoting proliferation, and impaired cell adhesion by mislocalizing EphB6, enhancing migration via the RhoA pathway and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest that HBP plays a critical role in regulating CRPC cell behavior, and targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic approach."
39462742,Local Treatment (Primary Tumor and Metastases) in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"For patients with low-volume de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, addition of an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and prostate radiotherapy to the standard (SOC) improves survival in comparison to the next most effective strategy (SOC + ARPI). For the subgroup with prior definitive treatment of the primary tumor, long-term outcomes and genomic predictors of response to metastasis-directed therapy suggest that this might be a reasonable option in selected patients."
39462366,A case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Is HPV infected by oral sex the causative agent?,"BACKGROUND: The integration of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA into the human genome has been implicated in cervical carcinogenesis and head and neck squamous cell cancer. However, its role in lung squamous cell carcinoma is not well understood. In addition, tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer(LC) share similar clinical symptoms and imaging features, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with a 16-month history of hemoptysis, chest pain, and occasional fatigue, without fever, chills, or history of mechanical damage or autoimmune diseases. Examination revealed normal vital signs and laboratory parameters, except for a positive interferon-gamma release assay indicating tuberculosis infection. Bronchoscopic examinations identified congestion and edema of the tracheal wall, along with a tiny lesion in the right wall of the trachea. She had been misdiagnosed with tuberculosis. However, the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was eventually confirmed by endoscopic biopsy. The patient's macrogenomic second-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the bronchoscopic biopsy specimen was positive for HPV-16.The patient's sex partner tested positive for HPV-16 in penile scrapings, indicating HPV transmission through oral sex. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the potential for HPV infection acquired through oral sex to lead to lung squamous cell carcinoma. It emphasizes the importance of considering HPV-associated malignancies in patients with respiratory symptoms who engage in oral sexual behaviors."
39457663,"Changes in TP53 Gene, Telomere Length, and Mitochondrial DNA in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Patients.","BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a growing issue due to an ageing population. Our study investigated the possible associations between BPH and ageing hallmarks, including the telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial genome copy number (mtDNA CN), along with genetic variations in the TP53 gene and mtDNA. METHODS: Prostate tissue samples were obtained from 32 patients with BPH, together with 30 blood samples. As a healthy control group, age-matching blood DNA samples were used. For the comparison of mtDNA sequence data, 50 DNA samples of the general Latvian population were used. The full mtDNA genome was analyzed by using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), the TP53 gene by Sanger sequencing, and the mtDNA copy number (mtDNA CN) and telomere length (TL) byqPCR assay. RESULTS: The results showed that in BPH patients, telomeres in the prostate tissue were significantly longer than in blood cells, while the TL in blood cells of the healthy controls was the shortest. Also, the mtDNA amount in the prostate tissue of BPH patients was significantly greater in comparison with blood cells, and controls had the smallest mtDNA CN. We did not find any mutations in the TP53 gene that could be linked to BPH; however, in mtDNA, we found several unique mutations and heteroplasmic changes, as well as genetic changes that have been previously associated with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, prolonged telomeres and changes in the mtDNA amount might be involved in the molecular mechanisms of BPH. Some of the heteroplasmic or homoplasmic mtDNA variants might also contribute to the development of BPH. Additional studies are needed to substantiate these findings."
39455978,Clinical relevance of protein-truncating variants of germline DNA repair genes in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Interpreting genetic variants remains a challenge in prostate cancer (PCa). Although many annotation tools are available for prioritizing causal variants, the clinical relevance of these variants is rarely studied. METHODS: We collected a cohort study that included 274 PCa patients from June 2017 to December 2020 and sequenced 19 DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in these patients and explored the clinical consequence of these different approaches. We also examined all-cause and PCa-specific survival in DDR gene mutation carriers compared to non-carriers after androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapy. RESULTS: We identified 13 variants from 19 DDR genes in a total of 14 (5.1%) patients who had at least one presumed pathogenic mutation using different annotation methods. Four variants were annotated as pathogenic, 11 variants were predicted as protein-truncating variants (PTVs), four variants received proxy-deleterious (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion scores of > 30), and only one variant was identified as a pathogenic variant or as having a functional effect by all three methods. PCa patients with PTVs were significantly associated with early onset, high cancer stage, and a worse response to AR-directed treatment. However, patients carrying a proxy-deleterious variant were only associated with a higher T (tumor) stage and N (node) stage than those without such a variant, but not associated with other clinical characteristics. In patients treated with AR-directed therapy, patients with a PTV showed an increased risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06 ~ 11.56) and PCa-specific death (aHR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.87 ~ 10.77) compared to non-PTV carriers after adjustment. We were unable to examine gene-specific risks due to the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: PTVs may assist in guiding treatment and early screening in PCa, while population-specific data for pathogenic variants are still being amassed."
39455902,Inflammation impacts androgen receptor signaling in basal prostate stem cells through interleukin 1 receptor antagonist.,"Chronic prostate inflammation in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) correlates with the severity of symptoms. How inflammation contributes to prostate enlargement and/or BPH symptoms and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we utilize a unique transgenic mouse model that mimics chronic non-bacterial prostatitis in men and investigate the impact of inflammation on androgen receptor (AR) in basal prostate stem cells (bPSC) and their differentiation in vivo. We find that inflammation significantly enhances AR levels and activity in bPSC. More importantly, we identify interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) as a crucial regulator of AR in bPSC during inflammation. IL-1RA is one of the top molecules upregulated by inflammation, and inhibiting IL-1RA reverses the enhanced AR activity in organoids derived from inflamed bPSC. Additionally, IL-1RA appears to activate AR by counteracting IL-1alpha's inhibitory effect. Furthermore, using a lineage tracing model, we observe that inflammation induces bPSC proliferation and differentiation into luminal cells even under castrate conditions, indicating that AR activation driven by inflammation is sufficient to promote bPSC proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, our study uncovers mechanisms through which inflammation modulates AR signaling in bPSC and induces bPSC luminal differentiation that may contribute to prostate hyperplasia."
39455029,Evaluation of a Task-Specific Self-Supervised Learning Framework in Digital Pathology Relative to Transfer Learning Approaches and Existing Foundation Models.,"An integral stage in typical digital pathology workflows involves deriving specific features from tiles extracted from a tessellated whole-slide image. Notably, various computer vision neural network architectures, particularly the ImageNet pretrained, have been extensively used in this domain. This study critically analyzes multiple strategies for encoding tiles to understand the extent of transfer learning and identify the most effective approach. The study categorizes neural network performance into 3 weight initialization methods: random, ImageNet-based, and self-supervised learning. Additionally, we propose a framework based on task-specific self-supervised learning, which introduces a shallow feature extraction method, employing a spatial-channel attention block to glean distinctive features optimized for histopathology intricacies. Across 2 different downstream classification tasks (patch classification and weakly supervised whole-slide image classification) with diverse classification data sets, including colorectal cancer histology, Patch Camelyon, prostate cancer detection, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and CIFAR-10, our task-specific self-supervised encoding approach consistently outperforms other convolutional neural network-based encoders. The better performances highlight the potential of task-specific attention-based self-supervised training in tailoring feature extraction for histopathology, indicating a shift from using pretrained models originating outside the histopathology domain. Our study supports the idea that task-specific self-supervised learning allows domain-specific feature extraction, encouraging a more focused analysis."
39454548,Safety and efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates plus immunotherapy in solid tumours: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Combining antibody-drug conjugate (ADCs) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is emerging as a promising treatment option to increase efficacy outcomes. However, concerns arise regarding the safety of these combinations, as some toxicities may overlap. Currently, there is still limited information about the safety profiles of this strategy. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify clinical trials investigating FDA-approved ADCs in combination with ICI drugs in the metastatic setting across all solid tumors. The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage of adverse events (AEs) of any grade and grade >/= 3. Secondary endpoints include the percentage of patients with AEs leading to death, treatment discontinuation, proportion of complete responses (CR) and overall response rate (ORR). A parallel search was conducted to quantify the safety profile of ADCs and ICIs in monotherapy. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen trials involving 1,133 patients treated with ADC plus ICI met the inclusion criteria with six different ADCs evaluated. Overall, 55.3 % of patients developed grade >/= 3 AEs, 30.0 % of patients had treatment discontinuation, and 3.0 % experienced AEs leading to death. When compared to trials evaluating ADC or ICI as monotherapy, the combination results in similar rates of the most common AEs. However, it increases the risk of specific toxicities, such as ILD/pneumonitis (15.0 % with T-DXd plus ICI vs. 11.5 % with T-DXd alone). The pooled ORR was 48.8 % (95 %CI 39.4 % - 58.4 %) and the CR rate was 9.0 % (95 %CI 5.5 - 14.5). PD-L1-positive tumors showed numerically better efficacy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the safety profile of the ADC plus ICI is comparable to that of ADC monotherapy. However, it increases the risk of certain toxicities of special interest, such as ILD/pneumonitis, highlighting the need for careful monitoring."
39452071,Contemporary Update on Clinical and Experimental Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Multi-Omics-Focused Approach to Detection and Risk Stratification.,"Prostate cancer remains a significant health challenge, being the most prevalent non-cutaneous cancer in men worldwide. This review discusses the critical advancements in biomarker discovery using single-omics and multi-omics approaches. Multi-omics, integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic data, offers a comprehensive understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer, leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This holistic approach not only enhances the specificity and sensitivity of prostate cancer detection but also supports the development of personalized treatment strategies. Key studies highlighted include the identification of novel genes, genetic mutations, peptides, metabolites, and potential biomarkers through multi-omics analyses, which have shown promise in improving prostate cancer management. The integration of multi-omics in clinical practice can potentially revolutionize prostate cancer prognosis and treatment, paving the way for precision medicine. This review underscores the importance of continued research and the application of multi-omics to overcome current challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy."
39452063,Cell Migration-Proliferation Dichotomy in Cancer: Biological Fact or Experimental Artefact?,"The migration-proliferation dichotomy (MPD) has long been observed in cultured cancer cells. This phenomenon is not only relevant to tumour progression but may also have therapeutic significance in clinical cancer. However, MPD has rarely been investigated in primary cancer. This study aimed to either confirm or disprove the existence of MPD in primary cancer. Using primary gastric, colorectal and prostate cancer (GC, CRC and PCa) cohorts from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, this study interrogated the MPD phenomenon by utilising RNA-Seq-based proliferation (CIN70 signature) and migration (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) indices, as well as gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). Alternative hypothetical migration-proliferation models-The simultaneous migration-proliferation (SMP) and phenotype-refractory (PR) models-were compared to the MPD model by probing the migration-proliferation relationships within cancer stages and between early- and late-stage diseases using chi-square and independent T tests, z-score statistics and GSEA. The results revealed an inverse relationship between migration and proliferation signatures overall in the GC, CRC and PCa cohorts, as well as in early- and late-stage diseases. Additionally, a shift in proliferation- to migration dominance was observed from early- to late-stage diseases in the GC and CRC cohorts but not in the PCa cohorts, which showed enhanced proliferation dominance in metastatic tumours compared to primary cancers. The above features exhibited by the cancer cohorts are in keeping with the MPD model of the migration-proliferation relationship at the cellular level and exclude the SMP and PR migration-proliferation models."
39451211,Phase Separation Mediated Sub-Nuclear Compartmentalization of Androgen Receptors.,"The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family of transcription factors, plays a crucial role not only in the development of the male phenotype but also in the development and growth of prostate cancer. While AR structure and AR interactions with coregulators and chromatin have been studied in detail, improving our understanding of AR function in gene transcription regulation, the spatio-temporal organization and the role of microscopically discernible AR foci in the nucleus are still underexplored. This review delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying AR foci formation, focusing on liquid-liquid phase separation and its role in spatially organizing ARs and their binding partners within the nucleus at transcription sites, as well as the influence of 3D-genome organization on AR-mediated gene transcription."
39450704,Germline DNA Damage Repair Variants and Prognosis of Patients with High-Risk or Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Deleterious germline variants in certain DNA repair genes are risk factors for developing aggressive prostate cancer. The objective was to quantify their prognostic impact after prostate cancer diagnosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Men with prostate cancer, predominantly of European ancestry, were included from four cohorts with long-term follow-up. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in 26 DNA repair genes were assessed in relation to metastasis-free survival in high-risk localized prostate cancer and to overall survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). RESULTS: Among 3,525 patients initially diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, 2,594 had high-risk localized prostate cancer, 429 had mCSPC, and 502 had mCRPC at inclusion. BRCA2 variant carriers did not have worse metastasis-free survival in high-risk localized prostate cancer [hazard ratio (HR), 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-1.46] or overall survival in mCSPC (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.14-1.45) or mCRPC (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.31-1.17) compared with noncarriers of DNA repair variants. Among 868 additional patients with de novo metastatic (M1) prostate cancer, BRCA2 variant carriers tended to have worse overall survival (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51). BRCA2 prognostic associations were not explained by radiation, PARP inhibitor, or platinum therapy. Results for other genes were limited in precision because variants were less common. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer who were initially diagnosed with and treated for nonmetastatic tumors, germline DNA repair variants in BRCA2 do not confer a substantially worse prognosis."
39449708,"Proteomics-based network pharmacology and molecular docking reveal the potential mechanisms of 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone against HeLa cancer cells.","Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of citrus-derived dietary 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (TMF) against HeLa cancer. Our study aims to elucidate its mechanisms of action through proteomics analysis, network pharmacology, and molecular docking. The results suggested that TMF demonstrated efficacy by upregulating CD40, CD40L, Fas, Fas-L, HSP27, HSP60, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGF-1sR, Livin, p21, p27, sTNFR2, TRAILR2, TRAILAR3, TRAILR4, XIAP, p-Sre, p-Stat1, p-Stat2 p-c-Fos, p-SMAD1, p-SMAD2, p-SMAD4, p-SMAD5, p-IkappaBalpha, p-MSK1, p-NFkappaB, p-TAK1, p-TBK1, p-ZAP70, and p-MSK2, while downregulating p-EGFR, p-ATF2, p-cJUN, p-HSP27, p-JNK, and p-GSK3A. These targets are primarily involved in MAPK, apoptosis, and TNF signaling pathways. Notably, p21, p27, EGFR, SMAD4, JNK, ATF2, and c-JUN merged as pivotal targets contributing to TMF's anti-cancer efficacy against HeLa cells. This study is first to delineate the potential signaling pathways and core targets of TMF in treating of HeLa cancer, paving the way for further exploration of TMF's medical potential."

39448300,Assessing the causal relationship between gut microbiota and prostate cancer: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies indicate that the gut microbiome is closely associated with prostate cancer (PCa), however, owing to various confounding factors, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and PCa remains unclear. METHODS: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilized genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on the gut microbiota of 18,340 participants and GWAS summary statistics on PCa involving 46,3010 participants. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) served as the primary method, complemented by the MR-Egger method, weighted median method (WME), simple mode method (SM), and weighted mode method (WM). Finally, to confirm the robustness of the results, heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out sensitivity test were conducted. RESULTS: IVW analysis revealed that 12 specific gut microbial taxa were potentially causally associated with PCa; the genera Victivallis, Akkermansia, Odoribacter, Butyrivibrio, and the families Enterobacteriaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, as well as the orders Verrucomicrobiales, Enterobacteriales and the class Verrucomicrobiae, were found to be positively associated with PCa risk. Conversely, the genera Eubacterium ruminantium group, Candidatus Soleaferrea, and RuminococcaceaeUCG003 were negatively associated with PCa risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study's results support a genetically predicted causal relationship between the gut microbiota and PCa, and we identified 12 specific gut microbial taxa. These findings could offer new targets for PCa screening and treatment."

39444678,Understanding the Biological Basis of Polygenic Risk Scores and Disparities in Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Genomic Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: For prostate cancer (PCa), hundreds of risk variants have been identified. It remains unknown whether the polygenic risk score (PRS) that combines the effects of these variants is also a sufficiently informative metric with relevance to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in prostate. We aimed to understand the biological basis of PRS and racial disparities in the cancer. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of the data generated (deposited in) by several genomic and/or transcriptomic projects (databases), including the GTEx, TCGA, 1000 Genomes, GEO and dbGap. PRS was constructed from 260 PCa risk variants that were identified by a recent trans-ancestry meta-analysis and contained in the GTEx dataset. The dosages of risk variants and the multi-ancestry effects on PCa incidence estimated by the meta-analysis were used in calculating individual PRS values. RESULTS: The following novel results were obtained from our analyses. (1) In normal prostate samples from healthy European Americans (EAs), the expression levels of 540 genes (termed PRS genes) were associated with the PRS (P < .01). (2) Ubiquitin-proteasome system in high-PRS individuals' prostates was more active than that in low-PRS individuals' prostates. (3) Nine PRS genes play roles in the cancer progression-relevant parts, which are frequently hit by somatic mutations in PCa, of PI3K-Akt/RAS-MAPK/mTOR signaling pathways. (4) The expression profiles of the top significant PRS genes in tumor samples were capable of predicting malignant PCa relapse after prostatectomy. (5) The transcriptomic differences between African American and EA samples were incompatible with the patterns of the aforementioned associations between PRS and gene expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided unique insights into the relationship between PRS and the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in prostate. The new findings, alongside the moderate but significant heritability of PCa susceptibility contributed by the risk variants, suggest the aptness and inaptness of PRS for explaining PCa and disparities."
39444485,The Role and Function of Secretory Protein Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: We started with RNA-seq analysis and aimed to investigate the possibility of secretory protein matrix metalloproteinase-3(MMP3) as a new diagnosis and therapeutic target in cervical cancer. METHODS: The study was conducted on Nov 2021 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical University, Qiqihar, China. Through conjoint analysis of gene expression data as well as survival rate data, we explored the potential secretary proteins associated with cervical cancer carcinogenesis. One hundred patients aged 38-72 years with clinical stage I-IV cervical cancer, and 100 age-matched healthy women were included. The expression changes in serum of clinical patients was detected. We knockdown or overexpressed the secretory proteins then explored its influence on biological function of cervical cancer cells. RESULTS: By cross-analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and MetazSecKB database, MMP3 gene was most significantly upregulated in cervical cancer patients (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MMP3 protein was remarkably increased in the serum of clinical cervical cancer patients and decreased after receiving treatment. Overexpression of MMP3 in HT-3 cells or culturing new cells using the supernatant of the medium after MMP3 overexpression could increase cell viability (P < 0.05) as well as proliferation (P < 0.05). Knockdown of MMP3 reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K as well as AKT proteins, while the PI3K phosphorylation inhibitors could suppress the impact of MMP3 on increasing cell proliferation as well as viability. CONCLUSION: MMP3 could be an underlying target for early diagnosis and treat cervical cancer in the future."
39443867,SPOT: spatial proteomics through on-site tissue-protein-labeling.,"BACKGROUND: Spatial proteomics seeks to understand the spatial organization of proteins in tissues or at different subcellular localization in their native environment. However, capturing the spatial organization of proteins is challenging. Here, we present an innovative approach termed Spatial Proteomics through On-site Tissue-protein-labeling (SPOT), which combines the direct labeling of tissue proteins in situ on a slide and quantitative mass spectrometry for the profiling of spatially-resolved proteomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficacy of direct TMT labeling was investigated using seven types of sagittal mouse brain slides, including frozen tissues without staining, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues without staining, deparaffinized FFPE tissues, deparaffinized and decrosslinked FFPE tissues, and tissues with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining, hematoxylin (H) staining, eosin (E) staining. The ability of SPOT to profile proteomes at a spatial resolution was further evaluated on a horizontal mouse brain slide with direct TMT labeling at eight different mouse brain regions. Finally, SPOT was applied to human prostate cancer tissues as well as a tissue microarray (TMA), where TMT tags were meticulously applied to confined regions based on the pathological annotations. After on-site direct tissue-protein-labeling, tissues were scraped off the slides and subject to standard TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis. RESULTS: Tissue proteins on different types of mouse brain slides could be directly labeled with TMT tags. Moreover, the versatility of our direct-labeling approach extended to discerning specific mouse brain regions based on quantitative outcomes. The SPOT was further applied on both frozen tissues on slides and FFPE tissues on TMAs from prostate cancer tissues, where a distinct proteomic profile was observed among the regions with different Gleason scores. CONCLUSIONS: SPOT is a robust and versatile technique that allows comprehensive profiling of spatially-resolved proteomics across diverse types of tissue slides to advance our understanding of intricate molecular landscapes."
39443815,Identifying the best candidate for focal therapy: a comprehensive review.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the evidence supporting the use of focal therapy (FT) in patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa), considerable variability exists in the patient selection criteria across current studies. This study aims to review the most recent evidence concerning the optimal approach to patient selection for FT in PCa. METHODS: PubMed database was systematically queried for studies reporting patient selection criteria in FT for PCa before December 31, 2023. After excluding non-relevant articles and a quality assessment, data were extracted, and results were described qualitatively. RESULTS: There is no level I evidence regarding the best patient selection approach for FT in patients with PCa. Current international multidisciplinary consensus statements recommend multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) followed by MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy for all candidates. FT may be considered in clinically localized, intermediate risk (Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3), and preferably unifocal disease. Patients should have an acceptable life expectancy. Those with prostate volume >50 ml and erectile dysfunction should not be excluded from FT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of < 20 (ideally < 10) ng/mL is recommended. However, the utility of other molecular and genomic biomarkers in patient selection for FT remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: FT may be considered in well-selected patients with localized PCa. This review provides a comprehensive insight regarding the optimal approach for patient selection in FT."
39443544,Profiling of urinary extracellular vesicle protein signatures from patients with cribriform and intraductal prostate carcinoma in a cross-sectional study.,"Prognostic tests and treatment approaches for optimized clinical care of prostatic neoplasms are an unmet need. Prostate cancer (PCa) and derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) proteome changes occur during initiation and progression of the disease. PCa tissue proteome has been previously characterized, but screening of tissue samples constitutes an invasive procedure. Consequently, we focused this study on liquid biopsies, such as urine samples. More specifically, urinary small extracellular vesicle and particles proteome profiles of 100 subjects were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 171 proteins that were differentially expressed between intraductal prostate cancer/cribriform (IDC/Crib) and non-IDC/non-Crib after correction for multiple testing. However, the strong correlation between IDC/Crib and Gleason Grade complicates the disentanglement of the underlying factors driving this association. Nevertheless, even after accounting for multiple testing and adjusting for ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grading, two proteins continued to exhibit significant differential expression between IDC/Crib and non-IDC/non-Crib. Functional enrichment analysis based on cancer hallmark proteins disclosed a clear pattern of androgen response down-regulation in urinary EVs from IDC/Crib compared to non-IDC/non-Crib. Interestingly, proteome differences between IDC and cribriform were more subtle, suggesting high proteome heterogeneity. Overall, the urinary EV proteome reflected partly the prostate pathology."
39442446,Plasma-based proteomic and metabolomic characterization of lung and lymph node metastases in cervical cancer patients.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in cervical cancer (CC), with a particular prevalence of lymph node and lung metastases. Patients with CC who have developed distant metastases typically face a poor prognosis, and there is a scarcity of non-invasive strategies for predicting CC metastasis. In this study, we utilized label-free proteomics and untargeted metabolomics to analyze plasma samples from 25 non-metastatic, 14 with lung metastasis, and 15 with lymph node metastasis CC patients. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed a shared inflammatory process between the two metastatic groups, while the central carbon metabolism in cancer showed distinct features in the lung metastasis cohort. Additionally, cholesterol metabolism, hypoxia-inducible factor 1, and ferroptosis signaling pathways were specifically altered in the lymph node metastasis group. Utilizing the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Random Forest algorithm, we identified two distinct biomarker panels for the prediction of lung metastasis and lymph node metastasis, respectively. The lung metastasis panel includes properdin, neural cell adhesion molecule 1, and keratin 6 A, whereas the lymph node metastasis panel consists of quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1, paraoxonase 1, and keratin 6 A. Each panel exhibited significant diagnostic potential, with high area under the curve (AUC) values for lung metastasis (training set: 0.989, testing set: 0.789) and lymph node metastasis (training set: 0.973, testing set: 0.900). This study conducted an integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis to clarify the factors contributing to lung and lymph node metastases in CC and has successfully established two biomarker panels for their prediction."
39441776,Effect of 5beta-dihydrotestosterone on vasodilator function and on cell proliferation.,"Aging is one of the main factors associated with cardiovascular diseases. Androgens exert beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and testosterone (TES) replacement therapy improves cardiometabolic risk factors. However, TES is contraindicated in patients with prostate cancer due to its proliferative effects on prostatic tumor cells. Additionally, TES and its reduced metabolites 5alpha- and 5beta-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT and 5beta-DHT) exert vasodilatory effects. Since androgen levels decrease during aging and 5beta-DHT lacks genomic effects, this study is focused on analyzing its effect on vasodilator function and the proliferation rate of prostatic tumor and vascular smooth muscle cells. To study the vascular function, mesenteric arteries from aged-orchidectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Mesenteric segments were divided into one control (without treatment) and three groups with the androgens (10 nM, 30 min) to analyze: acetylcholine- and sodium nitroprusside-induced responses and nitric oxide and superoxide anion production. To analyze cell proliferation, the effect of androgens on cell viability was determined. The results showed that 5beta-DHT improves vasodilator function in arteries from aged-orchidectomized rats and induces antioxidant action, while the proliferation rate of the androgen-dependent prostatic tumor cells remains unaltered. These results make 5beta-DHT a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiovascular pathologies."
39440958,Association of Race and Ethnicity with Genomic Testing at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in North Carolina.,Non-Hispanic Black patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2014 and 2019 and treated at a comprehensive cancer center were less likely to use tumor-specific genomic testing compared with non-Hispanic White patients. Disparities in the use of precision oncology technologies should be monitored and addressed to ensure equitable cancer care.
39440754,Germline variants of homology-directed repair or mismatch repair genes in cervical cancer.,"While cervical cancer is associated with a persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the progression to cancer is influenced by genomic risk factors that have remained largely obscure. Pathogenic variants in genes of the homology-directed repair (HDR) or mismatch repair (MMR) are known to predispose to diverse tumour entities including breast and ovarian cancer (HDR) or colon and endometrial cancer (MMR). We here investigate the spectrum of HDR and MMR germline variants in cervical cancer, with particular focus on the HPV status and histological subgroups. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing for 5 MMR genes and 12 HDR genes on 728 German patients with cervical dysplasia or invasive cancer. In total, 4% of our patients carried a pathogenic germline variant, based on ClinVar classifications and additional ESM1b and AlphaMissense predictions. These included 15 patients with truncating variants in HDR genes (BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, FANCM, RAD51D and SLX4). MMR-related gene variants were less prevalent and mainly of the missense type. While MMR-related gene variants tended to associate with adenocarcinomas, HDR gene variants were commonly observed in squamous cancers. While one patient with HPV-negative cancer carried a pathogenic MMR gene variant (in MSH6), the HDR germline variants were found in patients with HPV-positive cancers and tended to associate with HPV18. Taken together, our study supports a potentially risk-modifying role of MMR and HDR germline variants in cervical cancer but no association with HPV-negative status. These variants may be exploitable in future therapeutic managements."
39439457,Genetic associations of visfatin polymorphisms with clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate cancer in Taiwanese males.,"The most general cancer in men is prostate cancer (PCa), with its risk increasing due to age and obesity. Visfatin, a member of adipokines, is related to cancer progression and metastasis, but its relationship in PCa remains undetermined. In addition, no knowledge is available regarding relations between visfatin polymorphisms and clinicopathological characteristics in PCa. We sought to investigate the functions of four visfatin gene polymorphisms and clinicopathological characteristics on the hazard of developing PCa in 695 Taiwanese males with PCa. Carriers of the GA+AA heterozygote of SNP rs61330082 were at a markedly higher risk of biochemical recurrence than those with the GG genotype. Visfatin rs61330082 and rs11977021 were related with a high risk of perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and biochemical recurrence in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 10 PCa patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas database noted that visfatin mRNA level did not prominently differ with pathological T/N stage and overall survival. This finding is the first to document a connection between visfatin polymorphisms and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa in Taiwanese males."
39439211,Continuous Global Improvement of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Genotyping Services: The 2022 and 2023 HPV LabNet International Proficiency Studies.,"The International Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Reference Center launches annual global HPV genotyping proficiency panels to enhance the precision and international standardization of HPV genotyping services. This study aims to assess the proficiency levels achieved in the global HPV genotyping proficiency panels conducted in 2022 and 2023, and to evaluate trends in performance over time. The proficiency panels comprised 44 blinded samples each, including 40 samples containing various purified plasmids corresponding to HPV types combined with human DNA, plus four control samples (one negative control and three extraction controls). Proficiency required a sensitivity of 50 International Units (IU)/5 microL for HPV 16 and HPV 18 500 IU/5 microL for HPVs 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 and 500 genome equivalents (GE)/5 microL for other HPV types in both single and multiple infections, while avoiding false positivity. In 2022, 78 laboratories submitted a total of 154 data sets, and in 2023, 81 laboratories contributed 141 data sets. Most data sets (87%, 258/295) utilized commercially available HPV assays. Proficiency was common, with 77% of data sets meeting the proficiency criteria in 2022 and 79% in 2023. False positive results significantly decreased from 22% in 2022 to 13% in 2023. The high proficiency and increasing specificity in HPV genotyping services indicates progress toward more reliable HPV testing. High accuracy is crucial for supporting global efforts in HPV and cervical cancer elimination."
39434758,Ferroptosis-related gene signature predicts prognosis and immune microenvironment in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, significantly impacts cancer, yet its link to prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis remains underexplored. This study aims to develop and validate a ferroptosis-related gene signature to predict PCa prognosis and immune microenvironment differences, potentially identifying therapeutic targets. METHODS: RNA-sequencing data of 478 PCa patients and corresponding clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We investigated the disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the high- and low-risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Functional differences between the high- and low-risk groups were investigated by a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. The link between ferroptosis risk score and immune status was examined using CIBERSORT. The expression levels of core prognostic genes in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: A novel ferroptosis-related prognostic gene signature was established and tested in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Patients with PCa were classified into high- and low-risk groups based on this ferroptosis signature. Patients in the high-risk group had worse outcomes than those in the low-risk group. The predictive accuracy of the model was demonstrated by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. An additional enrichment analysis of TCGA cohort revealed the immune-related pathways were significantly upregulated in the high-risk group, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.85 at 1 year, 0.82 at 3 years, and 0.76 at 5 years. In the GEO cohort, the AUCs reached 0.69 at 1 year, 0.74 at 3 years, and 0.75 at 5 years. An additional enrichment analysis indicated a significant upregulation of cytokine-related pathways, immune receptor activity, and other immune-related pathways in the high-risk group. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the proportions of mast cells and plasma cells were significantly lower in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group of PCa patients. Conversely, the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. According to the qRT-PCR, Western blot, and IHC results, DRD4, SRC, AKR1C2, and AIFM2 expression was significantly higher in PCa than BPH. We also showed that the ferrostatin 1-treated LNCaP cells had higher expression levels of DRD4, SRC, and AKR1C2. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic signature of eight ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) that may accurately predict PCa patient outcomes was constructed and validated. FRGs may contribute to anti-tumor immunity and serve as therapeutic targets in PCa."
39433012,N1-methyladenosine RNA methylation patterns are associated with an increased risk to biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and serve as a potential novel biomarker for patient stratification.,"INTRODUCTION: N1-methyladenosine (m1A) RNA methylation is an emerging epigenetic modification. Its potential role in lipid metabolism and prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact of m1A on lipid metabolism and PCa prognosis. METHODS: In this work, the landscape of genetic and expression variations of 10 widely recognized m1A regulators in PCa was revealed. Combining machine-learning strategies, the m1A modification patterns and corresponding characteristics of lipid metabolism of PCa samples from the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) dataset were comprehensively analyzed. In vitro assays were performed to identify the role of TRMT61A, the key m1A regulator, on PCa cells. RESULTS: Two distinct m1A modification patterns and corresponding lipid metabolism profiles were identified in PCa. The m1A modification subgroup with a high risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) has stronger mitochondrial metabolism and FA oxidation activity. A consensus m1A modification-related lipid metabolism score (mMLMS) was constructed to predict the BCR prognosis of patients with PCa. The mMLMS was shown to accurately predict the BCR prognosis of PCa within six external cohorts. Finally, TRMT61A was identified as the key m1A regulator related to mMLMS, and it was found to promote the progression of PCa in vitro. TRMT61A potentially enhances mitochondrial function and FA beta oxidation in PCa cells via the PI3K/AKT pathway. CONCLUSION: m1A RNA methylation patterns are associated with characteristics of lipid metabolism in PCa, providing a novel treatment strategy."
39430616,Multivariable models of outcomes with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617: analysis of the phase 3 VISION trial.,"BACKGROUND: [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 ((177)Lu-PSMA-617) prolonged life in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in VISION (NCT03511664). However, distinguishing between patients likely and unlikely to respond remains a clinical challenge. We present the first multivariable models of outcomes with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 built using data from VISION, a large prospective phase 3 clinical trial powered for overall survival. METHODS: Adults with progressive post androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC received (177)Lu-PSMA-617 plus protocol-permitted standard of care (SoC) or SoC alone. In this post hoc analysis, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models of overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and a logistic regression model of prostate-specific antigen response (>/=50% decline; PSA50) were constructed and evaluated using C-index or receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses with bootstrapping validation. Nomograms were constructed for visualisation. FINDINGS: Patients were randomised between June 2018 and October 2019. Data from all 551 patients in the (177)Lu-PSMA-617 arm were analysed in multivariable modelling. The OS nomogram (C-index, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.76) included whole-body maximum standardised uptake value (SUV(max)), time since diagnosis, opioid analgesic use, aspartate aminotransferase, haemoglobin, lymphocyte count, presence of PSMA-positive lesions in lymph nodes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and neutrophil count. The rPFS nomogram (C-index, 0.68; 0.65-0.72) included SUV(max), time since diagnosis, opioid analgesic use, lymphocyte count, presence of liver metastases by computed tomography, LDH, and ALP. The PSA50 nomogram (area under ROC curve, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.77) included SUV(max), lymphocyte count and ALP. Performances of the OS and rPFS models were maintained when they were reconstructed excluding SUV(max). INTERPRETATION: These models of outcomes with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 are the first built using prospective phase 3 data. They show that a combination of pretreatment laboratory, clinical, and imaging parameters, reflecting both patient and tumour status, influences outcomes. These models are important for aiding treatment selection, patient management, and clinical trial design. FUNDING: Novartis."
39428439,The mendelian randomized study revealed the association of prostatitis with prostate cancer risk.,"In recent observational studies, a potential link between prostatitis and prostate cancer (PCa) has been hinted at, yet the causality remains ambiguous. In our endeavor to scrutinize the conceivable causal nexus between prostatitis and PCa, we embarked upon a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. MR circumvents arbitrary groupings by employing genetic variations that have a strong association with the exposure as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. The etiology of PCa remains elusive. Given that prostatitis and prostate cancer occupy the same anatomical region, MR can more effectively delineate their relationship by mitigating confounding variables. This method can indirectly elucidate disease correlations, thereby contributing to cancer prevention strategies. FinnGen Consortium data were used for the prostatitis genome-wide association study (GWAS), including 74,658 participants. UK biobank baseline data (ncase = 3436, ncontrol = 459574), European Bioinformatics Institute Database (ncase = 79148, ncontrol = 61106), and IEU openGWAS database (ncase = 79148, ncontrol = 61106) were used for PCa outcomes, mostly for European population samples. Data from the GWSAs for prostatitis were compared with data from the three GWASs for PCa, respectively, in an analysis of an MR. Utilizing the inverse variance weighting (IVW) methodology as our primary analytical framework, we delved into a meticulous exploration of the conceivable causal association between prostatitis and PCa. Furthermore, we deployed supplementary methodologies, including Maximum Likelihood, MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO, to thoroughly assess and scrutinize the causality aspect comprehensively. Cochran's Q statistic is employed as a metric to quantify the heterogeneity inherent in instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighted analysis revealed no discernible effect of prostatitis on PCa in the three PCa GWAS databases (odds ratio [OR]: 1.001, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.999-1.002, p = 0.28), (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 0.981-1.050, p = 0.40), (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 0.981-1.050, p = 0.40). Similarly, employing MR-Egger did not yield substantial evidence (OR: 0.999, 95% CI: 0.999-1.002, p = 0.89), (OR: 1.103, 95% CI: 1.006-1.209, p = 0.07), (OR: 1.103, 95% CI: 1.006-1.209, p = 0.07). The weighted median analysis also failed to provide convincing support for the impact of prostatitis on the incidence of PCa (OR: 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000-1.002, p = 0.064), (OR: 0.989, 95% CI: 0.946-1.034, p = 0.64), (OR: 0.989, 95% CI: 0.945-1.036, p = 0.65). The results of the MR showed no causality from prostatitis to PCa."
39424981,"Racial disparities in prostate cancer in the UK and the USA: similarities, differences and steps forwards.","In the USA, Black men are approximately twice as likely to be diagnosed with and to die of prostate cancer than white men. In the UK, despite Black men having vastly different ancestral contexts and health-care systems from Black men in the USA, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is two-to-three times higher among Black British men than among white British men and Black British men are twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as white British men. Examination of racial disparities in prostate cancer in the USA and UK highlights systemic, socio-economic and sociocultural factors that might contribute to these differences. Variation by ancestry could affect incidence and tumour genomics. Disparities in incidence might also be affected by screening guidelines and access to and uptake of screening. Disparities in treatment access, continuity of care and outcomes could contribute to survival differences. In both localized and metastatic settings, equal access could diminish the observed disparities in both the USA and the UK. An understanding of behavioural medicine, especially an appreciation of cultural beliefs about illness and treatment, could inform and improve the ways in which health systems can engage with and deliver care to patients in minoritized groups affected by prostate cancer. Methods of promoting equity include targeting systemic barriers including systemic racism, proportional recruitment of patients into clinical trials, diversifying the health-care workforce and facilitating care informed by cultural humility. Actively engaging patients and communities in research and intervention might enable the translation of research into increasingly equitable care for patients with prostate cancer in the UK, the USA and globally."
39424759,Integrating Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) Tests with Standard Cancer Screening: System Dynamics Model Development and Feasibility Testing.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer screening plays a critical role in early disease detection and improving outcomes. In Australia, established screening protocols for colorectal, breast and cervical cancer have significantly contributed to timely cancer detection. However, the recent introduction of multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests arguably can disrupt current screening, yet the extent to which these tests provide additional benefits remains uncertain. We present the development and initial validation of a system dynamics (SD) model that estimates the additional cancer detections and costs associated with MCED tests. AIM: This article describes the development of a simulation model built to evaluate the additional patient diagnoses and the economic impact of incorporating MCED testing alongside Australia's well-established standard of care (SOC) screening programs for colorectal, breast, cervical and lung cancers. The model was designed to estimate the additional number of patients diagnosed at each cancer stage (stage I, II, III, IV, or unknown) and the associated costs. This simulation model allows for the analysis of multiple scenarios under a plausible set of assumptions regarding population-level participation rates. METHODS: An SD model was developed to represent the existing SOC national cancer screening pathways and to integrate potential clinical pathways that could be introduced by MCED tests. The SD model was built to investigate three scenarios for the use of MCED testing: firstly, to explore the viability of MCED testing as a substitute among individuals who are not opting for SOC screening for any reason; secondly, to implement MCED testing exclusively for individuals ineligible for SOC screening, yet have high-risk characteristics; and thirdly, to employ MCED testing after SOC screening to serve as a triaging/confirmatory tool for individuals receiving inconclusive test results. The three primary scenarios were constructed by varying diagnostic accuracy and uptake rates of MCED tests. DISCUSSION: The clinical utility and outcomes of MCED testing for screening and early detection still lack comprehensive evidence. Nonetheless, this simulation model facilitates a thorough analysis of MCED tests within the Australian healthcare context, providing insights into potential additional detections and costs to the healthcare system, which may help prioritise future evidence development. The adaptable yet novel SD model presented herein is anticipated to be of considerable interest to industry, policymakers, consumers and clinicians involved in informing clinical and economic decisions regarding integrating MCED tests as cancer screening and early detection tools. The expected results of applying this SD model will determine whether using MCED testing in conjunction with SOC screening offers any potential benefits, possibly guiding policy decisions and clinical practices towards the adoption of MCED tests."
39422902,The interplay of dietary mycotoxins and oncogenic viruses toward human carcinogenesis: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Mycotoxins, fungal metabolites prevalent in many foods, are recognized for their role in carcinogenesis, especially when interacting with oncogenic viruses. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review synthesizes current evidence on the human cancer risk associated with mycotoxin exposure and oncogenic virus infections. METHODS: Searches were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on the PECOS framework. Data extraction involved narrative and qualitative presentation of findings, with meta-analysis where feasible. Risk of bias and outcome quality were assessed using the OHAT tool and GRADE approach. RESULTS: From 25 included studies, 18 focused on aflatoxins and hepatitis viruses in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four studies examined aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and human papilloma virus (HPV) in cervical cancer, while three investigated AFB1 with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphomagenesis. The review highlights a significant synergistic effect between AFB1 and hepatitis B and C viruses in HCC development. Significant interactions between AFB1 and HPV, as well as AFB1 and EBV, were observed, but further research is needed. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic impact of mycotoxins and oncogenic viruses is a critical public health concern. Future research, especially prospective cohort studies and investigations into molecular mechanisms, is essential to address this complex issue."
39421870,Somatic gene mutations involved in DNA damage response/Fanconi anemia signaling are tissue- and cell-type specific in human solid tumors.,"With significant advancements in the study of DNA Damage Response (DDR) and Fanconi Anemia (FA) signaling, we previously introduced the term ""FA signaling"" to encompass ""all signaling transductions involving one or more FA proteins."" This network has now evolved into the largest cellular defense network, integrating over 30 key players, including ATM, ATR, BLM, HRR6, RAD18, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, PALB2, RAD51C, SLX4, ERCC4, RAD51, BRCA1, UBE2T, XRCC2, MAD2L2, RFWD3, FAAP20, FAAP24, FAAP100, and CENPX. This system responds to both endogenous and exogenous cellular insults. However, the mutational signatures associated with this defense mechanism in non-FA human cancers have not been extensively explored. In this study, we report that different types of human cancers are characterized by distinct somatically mutated genes related to DDR/FA signaling, each accompanied by a unique spectrum of potential driver mutations. For example, in pan-cancer samples, ATM emerges as the most frequently mutated gene (5%) among the 31 genes analyzed, with the highest number of potential driver mutations (1714), followed by BRCA2 (4% with 970 putative driver mutations). However, this pattern is not universal across specific cancer types. For example, FANCT is the most frequently mutated gene in breast (14%) and liver (4%) cancers. In addition, the alteration frequency of DDR/FA signaling due to these mutations exceeds 70% in a subtype of prostate cancer, with each subtype of brain, breast, lung, and prostate cancers displaying distinct patterns of gene alteration frequency. Furthermore, these gene alteration patterns significantly impact patient survival and disease-free periods. Collectively, our findings not only enhance our understanding of cancer development and progression but also have significant implications for cancer patient care and prognosis, particularly in the development of effective therapeutic strategies."
39420658,LAMP-based electrochemical platform for monitoring HPV genome integration at the mRNA level associated with higher risk of cervical cancer progression.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) represent a diverse group of double-stranded DNA viruses associated with various types of cancers, notably cervical cancer. High-risk types of HPVs exhibit their oncogenic potential through the integration of their DNA into the host genome. This integration event contributes significantly to genomic instability and the progression of malignancy. However, traditional detection methods, such as immunohistochemistry or PCR-based assays, face inherent challenges, and thus alternative tools are being developed to fasten and simplify the analysis. Our study introduces an innovative biosensing platform that combines loop-mediated amplification with electrochemical (EC) analysis for the specific detection of HPV16 integration. By targeting key elements like the E7 mRNA, a central player in HPV integration, and the E2 viral gene transcript lost upon integration, we show clear distinction between episomal and integrated forms of HPV16. Our EC data confirmed higher E7 expression in HPV16-positive cell lines having integrated forms of viral genome, while E2 expression was diminished in cells with fully integrated genomes. Moreover, we revealed distinct expression patterns in cervical tissue of patients, correlating well with digital droplet PCR, qRT-PCR, or immunohistochemical staining. Our platform thus offers insights into HPV integration in clinical samples and facilitates further advancements in cervical cancer research and diagnostics."
39418984,Integrated single-cell transcriptomic analyses identify a novel lineage plasticity-related cancer cell type involved in prostate cancer progression.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer cell plasticity is the ability of neoplastic cells to alter their identity and acquire new biological properties under microenvironmental pressures. In prostate cancer (PCa), lineage plasticity often results in therapy resistance and trans-differentiation to neuroendocrine (NE) lineage. However, identifying the cancer cells harboring lineage plasticity-related status remains challenging. METHODS: Based on 13 multi-center human PCa bulk transcriptomic cohorts (samples = 3314) and 9 bulk transcriptomic datasets derived from PCa experimental models, we established an integrated lineage plasticity-related gene signature, termed LPSig. Leveraging this gene signature, AUCell enrichment analysis was applied to identify the cell population with high lineage plasticity from a comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) meta-atlas assembled by us, which consisted of 10 public human PCa scRNA-seq datasets (samples = 93, cells = 222,529). Moreover, additional scRNA-seq dataset of human PCa, multiplex immunohistochemistry staining for human PCa tissues, in vitro and in vivo functional experiments, as well as qPCR and Western blot analyses were employed to validate our findings. FINDINGS: We found that LPSig could finely capture the dynamics of tumor lineage plasticity throughout the progression of PCa, accurately estimating the status of lineage plasticity. Based on LPSig, we identified a previously undefined minority population of lineage plasticity-related PCa cells (LPCs) from the human PCa scRNA-seq meta-atlas assembled by this study. Furthermore, in-depth dissection revealed pivotal roles of LPCs in trans-differentiation, tumor recurrence, and poor patient survival during PCa progression. Furthermore, we identified HMMR as a representative cell surface marker for LPCs, which was validated using additional scRNA-seq datasets and multiplexed immunohistochemistry. Moreover, HMMR was transcriptionally inhibited by androgen receptor (AR), and was required for the aggressive adenocarcinoma features and NE phenotype. INTERPRETATION: Our study uncovers a novel population of lineage plasticity-related cells with low AR activity, stemness-like traits, and elevated HMMR expression, that may facilitate poor prognosis in PCa. FUNDING: This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFA0807000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82160584), Advanced Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Technology Innovation Team of Kunming Medical University (CXTD202216), and Reserve Talents of Young and Middle-aged Academic Leaders in Yunnan Province (202105AC160013)."
39417198,Identification of novel genomic hotspots and tumor-relevant genes via comprehensive analysis of HPV integration in Chinese patients of cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer accounts for 10-15% of cancer-related mortality among women globally. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types constitutes a significant etiological factor in the development of cervical carcinoma. The integration of HPV DNA into the host genome is considered a pivotal event in cervical carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying HPV integration and its role in promoting cancer progression remain inadequately understood. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential common denominators at HPV DNA integration sites and to analyze the adjacent cellular sequences. We conducted whole-genome sequencing on 13 primary cervical cancer samples, employing the chromosomal coordinates of 537 breakpoints to assess the statistical overrepresentation of integration sites in relation to various chromatin features. Our analysis, which encompassed all chromosomes, identified several integration hotspots within the human genome, notably at 14q32.2, 10p15, and 2q37. Additionally, our findings indicated a preferential integration of HPV DNA into intragenic and gene-dense regions of human chromosomes. A substantial number of host cellular genes impacted by the integration sites were associated with cancer, including IKZF2, IL26, AHRR, and PDCD6. Furthermore, the cellular genes targeted by integration were enriched in tumor-related terms and pathways, as demonstrated by gene ontology and KEGG analysis. In conclusion, these findings enhance our understanding of HPV integration sites and provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma."
39416786,"Genetic variants of LRRC8C, OAS2, and CCL25 in the T cell exhaustion-related genes are associated with non-small cell lung cancer survival.","BACKGROUND: T cell exhaustion is a state in which T cells become dysfunctional and is associated with a decreased efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Lung cancer has the highest mortality among all cancers. However, the roles of genetic variants of the T cell exhaustion-related genes in the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has not been reported. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with two previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets to explore associations between genetic variants in the T cell exhaustion-related genes and survival of NSCLC patients. We also performed expression quantitative trait loci analysis for functional validation of the identified variants. RESULTS: Of all the 52,103 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 672 T cell exhaustion-related genes, 1,721 SNPs were found to be associated with overall survival (OS) of 1185 NSCLC patients of the discovery GWAS dataset from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, and 125 of these 1,721 SNPs remained significant after validation in an additional independent replication GWAS dataset of 984 patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility (HLCS) Study. In multivariable stepwise Cox model analysis, three independent SNPs (i.e., LRRC8C rs10493829 T>C, OAS2 rs2239193 A>G, and CCL25 rs3136651 T>A) remained significantly associated with OS with hazards ratios (HRs) of 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-0.96, P = 0.008), 1.48 (95% CI = 1.18-1.85, P < 0.0001) and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.66-0.91, P = 0.002), respectively. Further combined analysis for these three SNPs suggested that an unfavorable genotype score was associated with a poor OS and disease-specific survival. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis suggested that the LRRC8C rs10493829 C allele was associated with elevated LRRC8C mRNA expression levels in normal lymphoblastoid cells, lung tissue, and whole blood. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that these functional SNPs in the T cell exhaustion-related genes may be prognostic predictors for survival of NSCLC patients, possibly via a mechanism of modulating corresponding gene expression."
39416194,RAD51 Paralogs and RAD51 Paralog Complexes BCDX2 and CX3 Interact with BRCA2.,"Homologous recombination (HR) is an important mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and preserving genome integrity. Pathogenic mutations in the HR proteins BRCA2 and the RAD51 paralogs predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. The RAD51 paralogs: RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3 form two complexes RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (BCDX2) and RAD51C-XRCC3 (CX3). Similar to BRCA2, loss of RAD51 paralog functions in mammalian cells lead to chromosomal abnormalities, growth defects, disrupted RAD51 foci formation, and PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Despite significant effort over the past three decades, the specific molecular functions of the human RAD51 paralogs have remained elusive due to technical challenges such as low protein expression in human cell lines and instability of the purified proteins. Recent studies have determined the molecular structures of the BCDX2 and CX3 complexes dramatically enhancing our understanding of these challenging proteins. Using multiple approaches, we demonstrate that the RAD51 paralogs interact with BRCA2 at two distinct interaction hubs located in the BRC repeats and the DNA binding domain. We confirm, using a yeast 3-hybrid approach, that human RAD51 paralogs interact directly with BRC repeats one and two (BRC1-2) of BRCA2. Because of the dynamic nature of the RAD51B C-terminal domain (CTD), identified in the recently solved cryo-EM structures, we focused on elucidating the interaction with RAD51B. We determined that BRCA2 interacts with the CTD of RAD51B and not the N-terminal domain (NTD) that is involved in stacking interactions with RAD51C and RAD51D. Furthermore, the interaction with RAD51B is dependent upon an FxxA motif located on a surface exposed region of the CTD. Our study has identified novel interactions between the RAD51 paralogs and BRCA2 and further demonstrated that a previously unrecognized FxxA motif located within a mobile element of RAD51B is critical for the interaction."
39414421,Molecular Correlates of Prostate Cancer Visibility on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to diagnose and stage prostate cancer (PCa), the biologic and clinical significance of MRI visibility of the disease is unclear. Our aim was to examine the existing knowledge regarding the molecular correlates of MRI visibility of PCa. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried through November 2023. We defined MRI-visible and MRI-invisible lesions based on the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, and compared these based on the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characteristics. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: From 2015 individual records, 25 were selected for qualitative data synthesis. Current evidence supports the polygenic nature of MRI visibility, primarily influenced by genes related to stroma, adhesion, and cellular organization. Several gene signatures related to MRI visibility were associated with oncologic outcomes, which support that tumors appearing as PI-RADS 4-5 lesions harbor lethal disease. Accordingly, MRI-invisible tumors detected by systematic biopsies were, generally, less aggressive and had a more favorable prognosis; however, some MRI-invisible tumors harbored molecular features of biologically aggressive PCa. Among the commercially available prognostic gene panels, only Decipher was strongly associated with MRI visibility. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: High PI-RADS score is associated with biologically and clinically aggressive PCa molecular phenotypes, and could potentially be used as a biomarker. However, MRI-invisible lesions can harbor adverse features, advocating the continued use of systemic biopsies. Further research to refine the integration of imaging data to prognostic assessment is warranted. PATIENT SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging visibility of prostate cancer is a polygenic trait. Higher Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System scores are associated with features of biologically and clinically aggressive cancer."
39413792,Redirecting the pioneering function of FOXA1 with covalent small molecules.,"Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) bind to and open closed chromatin, facilitating engagement by other regulatory factors involved in gene activation or repression. Chemical probes are lacking for pioneer TFs, which has hindered their mechanistic investigation in cells. Here, we report the chemical proteomic discovery of electrophilic compounds that stereoselectively and site-specifically bind the pioneer TF forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) at a cysteine (C258) within the forkhead DNA-binding domain. We show that these covalent ligands react with FOXA1 in a DNA-dependent manner and rapidly remodel its pioneer activity in prostate cancer cells reflected in redistribution of FOXA1 binding across the genome and directionally correlated changes in chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis supports a mechanism where the ligands relax the canonical DNA-binding preference of FOXA1 by strengthening interactions with suboptimal sequences in predicted proximity to C258. Our findings reveal a striking plasticity underpinning the pioneering function of FOXA1 that can be controlled by small molecules."
39411320,Recombinant adenoviruses expressing HPV16/18 E7 upregulate the HDAC6 and DNMT3B genes in C33A cells.,"OBJECTIVE: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is a carcinogenic virus associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer, as well as an increasing number of anal and oral cancers. The two carcinogenic proteins of HPV, E6 and E7, can immortalize keratinocytes and are essential for HPV-related cellular transformation. Currently, the global regulatory effects of these oncogenic proteins on the host proteome are not fully understood, and further exploration of the functions and carcinogenic mechanisms of E6 and E7 proteins is needed. METHODS: We used a previously established platform in our laboratory for constructing recombinant adenoviral plasmids expressing the HPV16 E7 gene to further construct recombinant virus particles expressing HPV16/18 E6, E7, and both E6 and E7 genes. These recombinant viruses were used to infect C33A cells to achieve sustained expression of the HPV16/18 E6/E7 genes. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted and RNA-Seq technology was employed for transcriptome sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes associated with HPV infection in cervical cancer. RESULTS: RNA-Seq analysis revealed that overexpression of the HPV16/18 E6/E7 genes upregulated GP6, CD36, HDAC6, ESPL1, and DNMT3B among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cervical cancer. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between the HDAC6 and DNMT3B genes and key pathways, including DNA replication, tumor proliferation signature, G2M checkpoint, p53 pathways, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Further, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses indicated that both HPV16/18 E7 can upregulate the expression of HDAC6 and DNMT3B, genes associated with HPV infection-related cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: The successful expression of HPV16/18 E6/E7 in cells indicates that the recombinant viruses retain the replication and infection capabilities of Ad4. Furthermore, the recombinant viruses expressing HPV16/18 E7 can upregulate the HDAC6 and DNMT3B genes involved in cervical cancer pathways, thereby influencing the cell cycle. Additionally, HDAC6 and DNMT3B are emerging as important therapeutic targets for cancer. This study lays the foundation for further exploration of the oncogenic mechanisms of HPV E6/E7 and may provide new directions for the treatment of HPV-related cancers."
39411203,Transcriptomic analysis reveals Streptococcus agalactiae activation of oncogenic pathways in cervical adenocarcinoma.,"Cervical adenocarcinoma (AC), a subtype of uterine cervical cancer (CC), poses a challenge due to its resistance to therapy and poor prognosis compared with squamous cervical carcinoma. Streptococcus agalactiae [group B Streptococcus (GBS)], a Gram-positive coccus, has been associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in CC. However, the underlying mechanism interaction between GBS and CC, particularly AC, remains elusive. Leveraging The Cancer Genome Atlas public data and time-series transcriptomic data, the present study investigated the interaction between GBS and AC, revealing activation of two pivotal pathways: 'MAPK signaling pathway' and 'mTORC1 signaling'. Western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and cell viability assays were performed to validate the activation of these pathways and their role in promoting cancer cell proliferation. Subsequently, the present study evaluated the efficacy of two anticancer drugs targeting these pathways (binimetinib and ridaforolimus) in AC cell treatment. Binimetinib demonstrated a cytostatic effect, while ridaforolimus had a modest impact on HeLa cells after 48 h of treatment, as observed in both cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. The combination of binimetinib and ridaforolimus resulted in a significantly greater cytotoxic effect compared to binimetinib or ridaforolimus monotherapy, although the synergy score indicated an additive effect. In general, the MAPK and mTORC1 signaling pathways were identified as the main pathways associated with GBS and AC cells. The combination of binimetinib and ridaforolimus could be a potential AC treatment."
39410563,Transforming Lung Cancer Management: A Promising Case Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Success Following a Multidisciplinary Approach.,"A 54-year-old female patient diagnosed with Stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (cT2aN3M0) initially received chemoradiotherapy. Two years after initial treatment, cancer relapse led to the administration of nivolumab, which was halted due to the development of drug-induced pneumonitis. Subsequent management with prednisolone and eight different cytotoxic agents failed to prevent metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes. The tumor's programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression rate was recorded at 10%. Four years after her diagnosis, the patient received a ninth-line therapy combining cisplatin, gemcitabine, and necitumumab, followed by palliative neck radiation due to increasing lymph node size. Remarkable tumor regression occurred three months after introducing atezolizumab as the tenth-line treatment, suggesting that previous treatments, particularly radiotherapy and cisplatin, might have enhanced PD-L1 expression, aligning with the existing literature. This case highlights the urgent need for further research to elucidate the intricate interplay between treatment history and PD-L1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma, emphasizing the importance of accumulating case studies to inform therapeutic strategies."
39409883,Revisiting HER2 in Prostate Cancer from an Inclusive Perspective: From Biomarkers to Omics.,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a major driver of disease progression, treatment resistance, and worse survival for patients with various types of cancers, including prostate cancer. However, key bench studies and clinical trials have failed to evaluate the role of HER2 in prostate cancer using racially diverse experimental designs and protocols. This lack of diversity represents what has been the status quo of cancer research in the United States for decades. In the case of prostate cancer, homogenic study designs are problematic as Black men are much more likely to be diagnosed and die from aggressive and incurable forms of the disease. Therefore, the strategic inclusion of biospecimens collected from Black patients as well as the recruitment and enrollment of Black men into prostate cancer clinical trials is necessary to comprehensively evaluate genetic and molecular factors that contribute to variable outcomes in this high-risk population. Additionally, a higher prevalence of HER2 expression in Black men was recently reported in a small cohort of prostate cancer patients and may contribute to worsened prognosis. In this review, we carefully consider the role of HER2 in prostate cancer while, for the first time, taking into account the influences of race and genetic ancestry."
39409053,The Role of Trace Metals in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.,"Over the years, prostate cancer (PCa) research has been of great interest, and trace metals have attracted a lot of attention due to their association with prostate cancer development and progression. PCa has a complex etiology, with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors being implicated. Trace metals such as zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), arsenic (As), and nickel (Ni) have garnered much attention in recent years, suspected of having direct links to the modulation of cancer risk and progression through their impacts on prostate cancer omics (genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and transcriptomics). This has led to them being the subject of extensive research in this regard. In this review, we explored the influence of trace metals and offered a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge on how trace metals affect the biology of prostate cancer at a molecular level by integrating findings from the recent literature to help suggest possible directions for future research."
39408981,Effects of Zinc Phthalocyanine Photodynamic Therapy on Vital Structures and Processes in Hela Cells.,"This work presents results on the efficiency of newly designed zinc phthalocyanine-mediated photodynamic therapy of both tumoral and nontumoral cell models using the MTT assay. Further detailed examinations of mechanistic and cell biological effects were focused on the HELA cervical cancer cell model. Here, ROS production, changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, the determination of genotoxicity, and protein changes determined by capillary chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry with ESI were analyzed. The results showed that, in vitro, 5 Jcm(-2) ZnPc PDT caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species. Still, except for superoxide dismutase, the levels of proteins involved in cell response to oxidative stress did not increase significantly. Furthermore, this therapy damaged mitochondrial membranes, which was proven by a more than 70% voltage-dependent channel protein 1 level decrease and by a 65% mitochondrial membrane potential change 24 h post-therapy. DNA impairment was assessed by an increased level of DNA fragmentation, which might be related to the decreased level of DDB1 (decrease in levels of more than 20% 24 h post-therapy), a protein responsible for maintaining genomic integrity and triggering the DNA repair pathways. Considering these results and the low effective concentration (LC50 = 30 nM), the therapy used is a potentially very promising antitumoral treatment."
39406723,Targeting IRE1alpha reprograms the tumor microenvironment and enhances anti-tumor immunity in prostate cancer.,"Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a central stress response pathway that is hijacked by tumor cells for their survival. Here, we find that IRE1alpha signaling, one of the canonical UPR arms, is increased in prostate cancer (PCa) patient tumors. Genetic or small molecule inhibition of IRE1alpha in syngeneic mouse PCa models and an orthotopic model decreases tumor growth. IRE1alpha ablation in cancer cells potentiates interferon responses and activates immune system related pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that targeting IRE1alpha in cancer cells reduces tumor-associated macrophage abundance. Consistently, the small molecule IRE1alpha inhibitor MKC8866, currently in clinical trials, reprograms the TME and enhances anti-PD-1 therapy. Our findings show that IRE1alpha signaling not only promotes cancer cell growth and survival but also interferes with anti-tumor immunity in the TME. Thus, targeting IRE1alpha can be a promising approach for improving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in PCa."
39406498,Theoretical framework for the difference of two negative binomial distributions and its application in comparative analysis of sequencing data.,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have been instrumental in investigating biological questions at the bulk and single-cell levels. Comparative analysis of two HTS data sets often relies on testing the statistical significance for the difference of two negative binomial distributions (DOTNB). Although negative binomial distributions are well studied, the theoretical results for DOTNB remain largely unexplored. Here, we derive basic analytical results for DOTNB and examine its asymptotic properties. As a state-of-the-art application of DOTNB, we introduce DEGage, a computational method for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scRNA-seq data. DEGage calculates the mean of the sample-wise differences of gene expression levels as the test statistic and determines significant differential expression by computing the P-value with DOTNB. Extensive validation using simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets demonstrates that DEGage outperforms five popular DEG analysis tools: DEGseq2, DEsingle, edgeR, Monocle3, and scDD. DEGage is robust against high dropout levels and exhibits superior sensitivity when applied to balanced and imbalanced data sets, even with small sample sizes. We utilize DEGage to analyze prostate cancer scRNA-seq data sets and identify marker genes for 17 cell types. Furthermore, we apply DEGage to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse neurons with and without fear memory and reveal eight potential memory-related genes overlooked in previous analyses. The theoretical results and supporting software for DOTNB can be widely applied to comparative analyses of dispersed count data in HTS and broad research questions."
39405603,Decoding androgen receptor signalling: Genomic vs. non-genomic roles in prostate cancer.,"The Androgen receptor (AR) is known to manifest the biological actions of male sex hormones. Androgens are now known to exert a multitude of responses, sometimes contrasting, in physiological and pathological conditions. Several groups have attempted to explain the underlying mechanisms of these varying androgen responses, including the non-genomic actions of androgens. These actions lead to increased activity of pro-proliferative signal transduction pathways, resulting in rapid molecular effects that cannot be explained by the conventional model in which AR functions as a transcription factor to modulate target gene expression [1,2]. This spotlight article examines Safi et al.'s research on the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer, revealing that low androgen levels drive proliferation via non-genomic mechanisms involving AR monomers, while high levels suppress growth through genomic actions with AR dimers. These findings challenge current paradigms and suggest novel therapeutic strategies targeting both AR forms, particularly focusing on the role of AR monomers in cancer progression and treatment resistance."
39404821,Relationships of dietary habits with prostate cancer risk: results from Mendelian randomization analyses and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"Background: Prior investigations identified correlations between dietary habits and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa); however, the causative dynamics are unclear. Methods: Utilizing the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, we investigated the causal links between dietary habits, daily nutrient intakes, and risk of PCa (79 148 cases and 61 106 controls). Exposure and outcome data were obtained from the UK Biobank and the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium, respectively. Univariable and multivariable MR analyses were employed. Sensitivity analyses were performed to detect outliers, evaluate heterogeneity, and discern potential pleiotropic effects. Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2009-2010), we selected 1294 and 1778 men aged >/=40 years from a pool of 10 537 participants, ensuring no missing information. Regression analyses examined the associations between leafy/lettuce salad intake, daily nutrient intake, and the odds of PCa. Results: Univariable MR (UVMR) analysis reveals that the intake of pork and salad/raw vegetable correlated with an elevated PCa risk. Subsequent to confounder adjustment via multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis, a causal link was established between salad/raw vegetable intake and an increased risk of PCa (odds ratio [OR]: 1.658, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.037-2.644, P = 0.046). The analysis based on NHANES datasets demonstrated a link between leafy/lettuce salad intake and heightened odds of PCa (OR: 1.025, 95% CI: 1.003-1.049, P = 0.038). Increased daily intakes of beta-carotene (original OR: 1.00006, 95% CI: 1.00001-1.00011, P = 0.024) and vitamin B1 (OR: 1.474, 95% CI: 1.104-1.967, P = 0.014) were associated with a higher likelihood of PCa. Conclusions: These MR analyses substantiate the causal nexus between salad/raw vegetable intake and PCa risk. Similarly, leafy/lettuce salad intake and the odds of PCa were significantly correlated in the cross-sectional observational study. Moreover, higher daily intakes of beta-carotene and vitamin B1 were linked to an increased likelihood of PCa. These findings provide practical dietary recommendations for PCa prevention and enhance early identification and diagnosis."
39402998,"Novel Zn(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) diflunisalato complexes with neocuproine and their exceptional antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines.","Three novel complexes of deprotonated diflunisal (dif) with neocuproine (neo) were synthesized and characterized via elemental, spectral (UV-vis, FTIR, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Although the compounds shared a similar composition of [MCl(dif)(neo)], where M represents Zn(II) (1), Co(II) (2) and Cu(II) (3), only 1 and 2 were isostructural, while 3 differed in both the molecular and supramolecular structures. In all three complex molecules, the central atom is coordinated by two nitrogen atoms of neo in a bidentate chelate mode, and one chlorido ligand and dif is bonded in either a monodentate mode via one oxygen atom of the carboxylate in 1 and 2 or in a bidentate chelate mode via both carboxylate oxygen atoms in 3. All three compounds demonstrated remarkable antiproliferative activity against human prostate (PC-3), colon (HCT116) and breast (MDA-MB-468) cancer cell lines with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range, with the lowest values observed in the case of PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 with 2 (20.0 nM) and 3 (31.1 nM), respectively. Moreover, complex 2, as the most active, was further investigated for its potential to induce perturbations in the cell cycle of PC-3 cells. The results indicated an induction of caspase-independent apoptosis. The interaction of the complexes with genomic DNA isolated from the respective cancer cell lines was evaluated for the intercalative mode, with binding strength correlated with the antiproliferative activity against PC-3 and MDA-MB-468 cancer cell lines."
39402324,Identification of a 5-gene signature panel for the prediction of prostate cancer progression.,"BACKGROUND: Despite nearly 100% 5-year survival for localised prostate cancer, the survival rate for metastatic prostate cancer significantly declines to 32%. Thus, it is crucial to identify molecular indicators that reflect the progression from localised disease to metastatic prostate cancer. METHODS: To search for molecular indicators associated with prostate cancer metastasis, we performed proteomic analysis of rapid autopsy tissue samples from metastatic prostate cancer (N = 8) and localised prostate cancer (N = 2). Then, we utilised multiple independent, publicly available prostate cancer patient datasets to select candidates that also correlate with worse prostate cancer clinical prognosis. RESULTS: We identified 154 proteins with increased expressions in metastases relative to localised prostate cancer through proteomic analysis. From the subset of these candidates that correlate with prostate cancer recurrence (N = 28) and shorter disease-free survival (N = 37), we identified a 5-gene signature panel with improved performance in predicting worse clinical prognosis relative to individual candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a new 5-gene signature panel that is associated with worse clinical prognosis and is elevated in prostate cancer metastasis on both protein and mRNA levels. Our 5-gene signature panel represents a potential modality for the prediction of prostate cancer progression towards the onset of metastasis."
39402008,"Targeting HPV for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Cervical Cancer.","Despite advances in screening and prevention, cervical cancer (CC) remains an unresolved public health issue and poses a significant global challenge, particularly for women in low-income regions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with the high-risk strains, is a primary driver of cervical carcinogenesis. Emerging evidence indicates that integrating HPV testing with existing approaches, such as cervical cytology and visual inspection, offers enhanced sensitivity and specificity in CC screening. HPV infection-associated biomarkers, including HPV E6/E7 oncogenes, p16;INK4a, DNA methylation signatures, and non-coding RNAs, offer valuable insights into disease progression and the development of personalized interventions. Preventive and therapeutic vaccination against HPV, along with tertiary prevention strategies such as the use of antiviral and immune-modulating drugs for HPV-related lesions, show great clinical potential. At the mechanistic level, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and the development of organoid models for HPV infection provide new cellular and molecular insights into HPV-related CC pathogenesis. This review focuses on the crucial roles of HPV in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CC, with particular emphasis on the latest advancements in screening and disease intervention."
39400837,Impact of Acute or Chronic Acidosis and Hypoxia on Gene Expression Patterns in Tumour Cells: Potential Functional Implications.,"Tumours often exhibit pronounced hypoxia and hereby extracellular acidosis due to intensified glycolysis. Since metabolic parameters can modulate gene expression, the aim of the study was to analyse changes in gene expression patterns induced by acute (24 h) acidosis or hypoxia and also in tumour cells adapted to long-term acidosis (5 weeks). Three tumour cell lines (AT1 prostate carcinoma, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma) were exposed to acidosis (pH 6.6) or hypoxia (pO(2) 1.5 mmHg) for 24 h. For long-term acidosis, AT1 tumour cells were continuously cultured at pH 6.6 for 5 weeks. Gene expression was examined by total RNA-sequencing and the functional significance was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology database. Under short-term acidosis (24 h), AT1 and MCF-7 cells showed comparable changes. 714 genes were acidosis-dependently regulated in AT1 cells (275 up, 439 down), and 221 genes in MCF-7 cells (95 up, 126 down). MDA-MB-231 cells almost did not respond to low pH (13 regulated genes). Hypoxia affected MCF-7 cells the most (1498 regulated genes), whereas fewer genes were regulated in AT1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Concerning the function of the regulated genes by short-term acidosis, RNA processing, cell cycle regulation, DNA synthesis, and mitochondrial function were negatively affected. Chronic acidosis showed a different picture. In AT1 cells, 1160 genes were differentially expressed (638 up, 522 down) when cells exposed to low pH for 5 weeks. The putatively acidosis-induced changes in functions included tissue structural development, RNA processing, and mitochondrial activity. This study shows that both acute and chronic acidosis of tumour cells lead to altered gene expression and thus affect cell function. Long-term acidosis leads to fundamentally different changes, indicating an adaptation process of the tumour cells."
39400626,PARP1 acetylation at K119 is essential in regulating the progression and proliferation of cervical cancer cells.,"Cervical cancer, CC, is one of the malignant cancers in women worldwide. Many studies about the genesis and progression of CC have been done at genomic, transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic levels. However, much less is done at post-translational modification (PTM) level. We first used pan-PTM antibodies to compare the pan PTM levels between clinical normal cervical tissues and CC tissues; we then sent the selected samples for label-free identification of acetylation sites. Next, we employed WT or K119A mutant PARP1-EGFP-STREPII plasmid transfection in Hela cells and examined various indexes including colony formation, wound healing, ROS generation, early apoptosis, and immunofluorescence and quantification of proliferation markers (Ki67, PCNA, and p-P53). Last, we examined the levels of multiple important kinases regulating cervical cancer progression. We found that pan-acetylation was the most downregulated in clinical CC samples, whereas the acetylation of PARP1, Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, was upregulated at K119. Next, we showed that PARP1-WT overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and progression in CC cell line Hela, while K119A overexpression didn't show any impact. Finally, PARP1-WT overexpression significantly decreased p-ERK1/2 while didn't affect the phosphorylation levels of other important kinases such as AKT, MTOR, and RPS6. This study discovered a new type of PTM of PARP1 in CC, and showed that PARP1 acetylation at K119 is essential in regulating the proliferation and progression of CC through ERK1/2. Further studies are required to investigate how PARP1 acetylation impact its function."
39400371,Integrating Multi-Omics Data to Uncover Prostate Tissue DNA Methylation Biomarkers and Target Genes for Prostate Cancer Risk.,"Previous studies have indicated that specific CpG sites may be linked to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) by regulating the expression of PCa target genes. However, most existing studies aim to identify DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers through blood tissue genetic instruments, which impedes the identification of relevant biomarkers in prostate tissue. To identify PCa risk-associated CpG sites in prostate tissue, we established genetic prediction models of DNAm levels using data from normal prostate samples in the GTEx (N = 108) and assessed associations between genetically predicted DNAm in prostate and PCa risk by studying 122,188 cases and 604,640 controls. We observed significant associations for 3879 CpG sites, including 926 at novel genomic loci. Among them, DNAm levels of 80 CpG sites located at novel loci are significantly associated with expression levels of 45 neighboring genes in normal prostate tissue. Of these genes, 11 further exhibit significant associations with PCa risk for their predicted expression levels in prostate tissue. Intriguingly, a total of 31 CpG sites demonstrate consistent association patterns across the methylation-gene expression-PCa risk pathway. Our findings suggest that specific CpG sites may be related to PCa risk by modulating the expression of nearby target genes."
39400339,Viral whole genome sequencing reveals high variations in APOBEC3 editing between HPV risk categories.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are responsible for cervical cancer. However, little is known about the differences between HPV types and risk categories regarding their genetic diversity and particularly APOBEC3-induced mutations - which contribute to the innate immune response to HPV. Using a capture-based next-generation sequencing, 156 HPV whole genome sequences covering 43 HPV types were generated from paired cervical and anal swabs of 30 Togolese female sex workers (FSWs) sampled in 2017. Genetic diversity and APOBEC3-induced mutations were assessed at the viral whole genome and gene levels. Thirty-four pairwise sequence comparisons covering 24 HPV types in cervical and anal swabs revealed identical infections in the two anatomical sites. Differences in genetic diversity among HPV types was observed between patients. The E6 gene was significantly less conserved in low-risk HPVs (lrHPVs) compared to high-risk HPVs (hrHPVs) (p = 0.009). APOBEC3-induced mutations were found to be more common in lrHPVs than in hrHPVs (p = 0.005), supported by our data and by using large HPV sequence collections from the GenBank database. Focusing on the most common lrHPVs 6 and 11 and hrHPVs 16 and 18, APOBEC3-induced mutations were predominantly found in the E4 and E6 genes in lrHPVs, but were almost absent in these genes in hrHPVs. The variable APOBEC3 mutational signatures could contribute to the different oncogenic potentials between HPVs. Further studies are needed to conclusively determine whether APOBEC3 editing levels are associated to the carcinogenic potential of HPVs at the type and sublineage scales."
39398648,Microsatellite Instability-High and High Tumor Mutation Burden Frequencies in Urologic Malignancies Off-Label for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Japan: A Retrospective Single-Institutional Cohort.,"Objectives Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and high tumor mutation burden (TMB-high) frequencies were investigated to determine the efficacy and adverse events of pembrolizumab in patients with urologic malignancies (or their equivalents) for which immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are not covered by Japanese insurance. Methods Between February 2019 and April 2024, patients with urologic malignancies (or their equivalents) treated in our department for whom ICIs were not approved by Japanese insurance were screened with an MSI companion diagnostic kit or comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). The efficacy of pembrolizumab therapy, presence of adverse events, and outcomes were evaluated retrospectively in patients with MSI-H or TMB-high. Results In total, 44 patients were tested, and the median age at testing was 70 years. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was the most common (n = 31). Overall, 49 tests were performed, including 22 MSI companion diagnostic kits and 27 CGP tests. Of the 49 tests, 1 detected MSI-H, 2 detected TMB-high, and 1 detected simultaneous MSI-H/TMB-high, with detection rates of 4.1% and 11.1% for MSI-H and TMB-high, respectively. A patient with MSI-H CRPC and neuroendocrine differentiation achieved a complete response and a prolonged duration of response to pembrolizumab without adverse events. The duration of response to pembrolizumab was shorter in a patient with TMB-high, and a CRPC patient with simultaneously detected MSI-H/TMB-high had to discontinue pembrolizumab early due to immune-related adverse events. Conclusions Despite the potential benefit of pembrolizumab, MSI-H or TMB-high was less frequently detected in urologic malignancies for which ICIs are not covered by Japanese insurance."
39397489,From Lawn to Health: Understanding the Prostate Cancer Risk in Light DIY Activities.,"This study employs two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between light DIY activities and prostate cancer. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with light DIY activities obtained from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and summary-level genetic data related to prostate cancer from published GWAS. The primary analysis was conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method for two-sample MR analysis. Cochran's Q statistic was used to assess heterogeneity, MR-Egger was employed to detect horizontal pleiotropy, and ""leave-one-out"" analysis was performed for sensitivity analysis. Given the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effects IVW method was used for the primary analysis. The random-effects IVW results indicated a positive causal relationship between participation in light DIY activities and the risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.024, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.001-1.048; p = .039). The weighted median (WM) method results supported this finding (OR = 1.025, 95% CI: 1.003-1.048; p = .024). Participation in light DIY activities may slightly increase the risk of prostate cancer. This finding emphasizes the need to carefully consider the types and intensities of physical activities when making public health recommendations and personal lifestyle choices."
39395905,Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq revealed key genes for bone metastasis and chemoresistance in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a serious malignancy. The main causes of PCa aggravation and death are unexplained resistance to chemotherapy and bone metastases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the dynamic processes of progression, bone metastasis, and chemoresistance in PCa. METHODS: Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) tumor progression and metastasis-related genes were identified. These genes were subjected to lasso regression modeling using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to evaluate osteoclast differentiation. CellMiner was used to confirm the effect of LDHA on chemoresistance. Finally, the relationship between LDHA and chemoresistance was verified using doxorubicin-resistant PCa cell lines. RESULTS: 7928 genes were identified as genes related to tumor progression and metastasis. Of these, 7 genes were found to be associated with PCa prognosis. The scRNA-seq and TCGA data showed that the expression of LDHA was higher in tumors and associated with poor prognosis of PCa. In addition, upregulation of LDHA in PCa cells induces osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, high LDHA expression was associated with resistance to Epirubicin, Elliptinium acetate, and doxorubicin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that LDHA knockdown inhibited doxorubicin resistance in PCa cells. CONCLUSIONS: LDHA may play a potential contributory role in PCa initiation and development, bone metastasis, and chemoresistance. LDHA is a key target for the treatment of PCa."
39394013,Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer. Report from the 2024 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC).,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Innovations have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer (PC). Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of topics that greatly impact daily practice. The 2024 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) surveyed experts on key questions in clinical management in order to supplement evidence-based guidelines. Here we present voting results for questions from APCCC 2024. METHODS: Before the conference, a panel of 120 international PC experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 183 multiple-choice consensus questions on eight different topics. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the voting panel members (""panellists""). KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Consensus was a priori defined as >/=75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as >/=90% agreement. The voting results show varying degrees of consensus, as discussed in this article and detailed in the Supplementary material. These findings do not include a formal literature review or meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The voting results can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers in prioritising areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised on the basis of patient and cancer characteristics, and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2024 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials."
39393034,"5-Hydroxymethylated Biomarkers in Cell-Free DNA Predict Occult Colorectal Cancer up to 36 Months Before Diagnosis in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.","PURPOSE: Using the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial samples, we identified cell-free DNA (cfDNA) candidate biomarkers bearing the epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) that detected occult colorectal cancer (CRC) up to 36 months before clinical diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed the 5hmC-seal assay and sequencing on </=8 ng cfDNA extracted from PLCO study participant plasma samples, including n = 201 cases (diagnosed with CRC within 36 months of blood collection) and n = 401 controls (no cancer diagnosis on follow-up). We conducted association studies and machine learning modeling to analyze the genome-wide 5hmC profiles within training and validation groups that were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. RESULTS: We successfully obtained 5hmC profiles from these decades-old samples. A weighted Cox model of 32 5hmC-modified gene bodies showed a predictive detection value for CRC as early as 36 months before overt tumor diagnosis (training set AUC, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.2 to 81.9] and validation set AUC, 72.8% [95% CI, 65.8 to 79.7]). Notably, the 5hmC-based predictive model showed comparable performance regardless of sex and race/ethnicity, and significantly outperformed risk factors such as age and obesity (assessed as BMI). Finally, when splitting cases at median weighted prediction scores, Kaplan-Meier analyses showed significant risk stratification for CRC occurrence in both the training set (hazard ratio, [HR], 3.3 [95% CI, 2.6 to 5.8]) and validation set (HR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.8 to 5.8]). CONCLUSION: Candidate 5hmC biomarkers and a scoring algorithm have the potential to predict CRC occurrence despite the absence of clinical symptoms and effective predictors. Developing a minimally invasive clinical assay that detects 5hmC-modified biomarkers holds promise for improving early CRC detection and ultimately patient outcomes."
39391470,"Identification of molecular subtypes, prognostic status and immunotherapy response in cervical cancer based on angiogenic signature genes.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, as one of the most common malignancies in women, is closely related to the mechanism of angiogenesis, which needs further exploration. METHODS: The squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and cervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. CESC subtypes based on 48 angiogenesis-related genes were identified using consistent cluster analysis, and the limma package were adopted to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with prognosis. Further compress the DEGs through univariate and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) COX analysis to identify the key genes. Calculate immune scores using the GSVA package and predict immunotherapy response with TIDE. For in vitro analysis, the expressions of these key genes were additionally tested via reverse-transcription quantitative PCR, and the migration and invasion of Hela cells were determined in scratch and transwell assays, respectively. RESULTS: 3 CESC subtypes were identified, with the best survival advantage in the C2 subtype and the worst in C1 subtype. A risk model was established utilizing seven key genes (MMP3, DLL4, CAP2, PDIA6, TCN2, PAPSS2, and VCAM1), showcases an Area Under the Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.7, underlining its robust performance. The risk score model showed a trend of poorer survival for patients in the high-risk score group and good agreement across different datasets. A nomogram was constructed, and calibration curves indicated robust predictive performance. Immunological analysis revealed heightened sensitivity to immunotherapy in the low-risk group. Besides, the elevated expressions of all 7 genes were seen in Hela cells, and the specific target-mediated DLL4 knockdown diminished the migration and invasion of Hela cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: This research provides fresh insights and a valuable tool to guide therapeutic decision-making for CESC."
39391238,The role of extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis of gynecological cancer.,"Gynecological cancer, the most common form of cancers in women worldwide, initiates in the reproductive organs of females. More often, the common treatment measures, i.e. surgery, radiation, and medical oncology are found to be unsuccessful in the treatment of gynecological tumors. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of gynecological cancers by distinct mechanisms. The present review highlights how EVs contribute to the progression of different types of gynecological cancers such as cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, vaginal cancer, uterine sarcoma, gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), and vulvar cancer. The primary focus is to understand how EVs' cargo alters the phenotypic response of the recipient cells, thereby contributing to the progression of the disease, thus can be considered as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker. A brief discussion on the role of EVs in the diagnosis and prognosis of different gynecological cancer types is also highlighted. Targeting the biogenesis of the EVs, their inside cargo, and EVs uptake by the recipient cells could be a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of gynecological cancer beside conventional therapeutic means."
39390760,Reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in prostate cancer murine models and patients following white button mushroom treatment.,"BACKGROUND: In a previously reported Phase I trial, we observed therapy-associated declines in circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with the administration of white button mushroom (WBM) tablets in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. These observations led us to hypothesise that WBM could mitigate PCa progression by suppressing MDSCs. METHODS: We performed bidirectional translational research to examine the immunomodulatory effects of WBM consumption in both syngeneic murine PCa models and patients with PCa participating in an ongoing randomised Phase II trial (NCT04519879). RESULTS: In murine models, WBM treatment significantly suppressed tumour growth with a reduction in both the number and function of MDSCs, which in turn promoted antitumour immune responses mediated by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In patients, after consumption of WBM tablets for 3 months, we observed a decline in circulating polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), along with an increase in cytotoxic CD8(+) T and NK cells. Furthermore, single immune cell profiling of peripheral blood from WBM-treated patients showed suppressed STAT3/IRF1 and TGFbeta signalling in circulating PMN-MDSCs. Subclusters of PMN-MDSCs presented transcriptional profiles associated with responsiveness to fungi, neutrophil chemotaxis, leukocyte aggregation, and regulation of inflammatory response. Finally, in mouse models of PCa, we found that WBM consumption enhanced the anticancer activity of anti-PD-1 antibodies, indicating that WBM may be used as an adjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our results from PCa murine models and patients provide mechanistic insights into the immunomodulatory effects of WBM and provide a scientific foundation for WBM as a nutraceutical intervention to delay or prevent PCa progression. HIGHLIGHTS: White button mushroom (WBM) treatment resulted in a reduction in pro-tumoural MDSCs, notably polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), along with activation of anti-tumoural T and NK cells. Human single immune cell gene expression profiling shed light on the molecular alterations induced by WBM, specifically on PMN-MDSCs. A proof-of-concept study combining WBM with PD-1 blockade in murine models revealed an additive effect on tumour regression and survival outcomes, highlighting the clinical relevance of WBM in cancer management."
39390559,KLF14 directly downregulates the expression of GPX4 to exert antitumor effects by promoting ferroptosis in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide, and effective therapeutic strategies for its treatment are limited. Recent studies have indicated that ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, is a promising therapeutic strategy. KLF14 has been shown to regulate both cell proliferation and apoptosis in cervical cancer. However, its role in modulating lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis remains largely unexplored and enigmatic. METHODS: SiHa and HeLa cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors to overexpress KLF14. Protein levels were analyzed via western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). LDH assays, calcein-AM/propidium iodide (PI) staining, and generation of cell growth curves using a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system were used to detect cell damage and proliferation. Cellular ROS, lipid ROS, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fe(2+) assays and a xenograft mouse model were used to measure the level of ferroptosis. Proteomics combined with bioinformatics methods was used to screen target genes regulated by KLF14, and CUT&Tag and dual-luciferase assays confirmed the repression of GPX4 by KLF14 via direct binding to its promoter. RESULTS: KLF14 is abnormally expressed in various tumors and downregulated in cervical cancer. Overexpression of KLF14 induced ferroptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in vitro as well as xenograft tumorigenicity in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that KLF14 binds to the promoter of GPX4, suppressing its transcriptional activity and thereby decreasing its expression, which contributes to the induction of ferroptosis. Truncation and point mutation analyses of the GPX4 promoter revealed multiple binding sites for KLF14 within the - 1000 bp to + 35 bp region, which are responsible for its inhibitory effect on GPX4 transcription. Additionally, deletion of the zinc finger motif in KLF14 abolished its inhibitory effect on GPX4 promoter activity and cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed a previously unidentified function of KLF14 in promoting ferroptosis, which results in the suppression of cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we revealed a novel regulatory mechanism by which KLF14 targets GPX4. These findings suggest a novel strategy to induce ferroptosis through the targeting of KLF14 in human cervical cancer cells."
39390542,Circulating levels of cytokines and risk of urologic cancers: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is associated with the etiology of various cancers. However, there is a lack of systematic research in urologic cancers. This study aims to use a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the role of circulating cytokines in the development of urologic cancers. METHODS: We obtained the summary-level data for bladder cancer (373,295 cases and 372,016 controls), prostate cancer (462,933 cases and 459,664 controls), and kidney cancer (463,010 cases and 461,896 controls) from the UK Biobank. Genetic variations linked to 41 circulating cytokines were used as instrumental variables (IVs) in meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) involving 8,293 individuals from Finland. We primarily used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method to assess the potential associations between the 41 cytokines and the risk of 3 common urologic cancers. Weighted-median method, weighted mode and simple-median method were used to assess the sensitivity. Heterogeneity and pleiotropic outlier were evaluated by Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression. Genetic correlation, colocalization analysis and multivariable MR analysis were used to further validate the potential pleiotropy. RESULTS: After the Bonferroni correction, there was an observed association between elevated genetically predicted levels of CCL27 and a heightened risk for bladder cancer. Conversely, IL-12p70 levels were found to have a protective association against the risk of bladder cancer. Sensitivity analyses utilizing various IV sets and MR approach remained robust. Furthermore, we found potential associations of 7 cytokines with urologic cancers (4.07 x 10(-4) </= P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study supported causal associations between CCL27, IL-12p70 and bladder cancer risk and potential associations of 7 cytokines with the risk of urologic cancers, helping us to further understand the pathogenesis of urologic cancers and providing clues for improving diagnostic accuracy and therapies."
39390262,Methylation-based immune deconvolution in prostate cancer patients before and after radical prostatectomy.,"PURPOSE: Surgery, an established short-term immunosuppressive event, may spur dissemination of circulating tumor cells and promote the growth of micrometastases. Whether surgical treatment for prostate cancer (i.e., radical prostatectomy) leads to long-term immune changes is unknown. METHODS: We characterized intra-individual changes in circulating immune cell subsets across a six-month period using serial blood samples from prostate cancer patients pre- and post-radical prostatectomy (n = 11), and from a comparison group managed with active surveillance (n = 8). Immune cell subsets for each patient at each time point were deconvoluted using genome-wide methylation data. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant intra-individual changes in immune cell proportions from pre- to six months post-radical prostatectomy. There were also no intra-individual changes in immune cell proportions in the active surveillance group, and no differences between treatment groups in immune cell changes over time. CONCLUSION: We observed no meaningful changes in circulating immune cell subsets six months after radical prostatectomy, suggesting that surgery-induced immune changes may not be long-lasting."

39386487,Fine Mapping Regulatory Variants by Characterizing Native CpG Methylation with Nanopore Long-Read Sequencing.,"5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most common chemical modification occurring on the CpG sites across the human genome. Bisulfite conversion combined with short-read whole genome sequencing can capture and quantify the modification at single nucleotide resolution. However, the PCR amplification process could lead to duplicative methylation patterns and introduce 5mC detection bias. Additionally, the limited read length also restricts co-methylation analysis between distant CpG sites. The bisulfite conversion process presents a significant challenge for detecting variant-specific methylation due to the destruction of allele information in the sequencing reads. To address these issues, we sought to characterize the human methylation profiling with the nanopore long-read sequencing, aiming to demonstrate its potential for long-range co-methylation analysis with native modification call and intact allele information retained. In this regard, we first analyzed the nanopore demo data in the adaptive sampling sequencing run targeting all human CpG islands. We applied the linkage disequilibrium (LD) R(2) to calculate the co-methylation in nanopore data, and further identified 27,875, 50,481, 26,542 and 51,189 methylation haplotype blocks (MHB) in COLO829, COLO829BL, HCC1395 and HCC1395BL cell lines, respectively. Interestingly, while we found that majority of the co-methylation were in a short range (</=200bp), a small portion (1~3%) showed long distance (>/=1,000bp), suggesting potential remote regulatory mechanisms across the genome. To further characterize the epigenetic changes related to transcription factor binding, we profiled the 5mC percentage changes surrounding various motif sites in JASPAR collection and found that CTCF and KLF5 binding sites showed reduced methylation, while FOXE1 and ZNF354A sites showed increased methylation. To further investigate the allele-specific 5mCG in the prostate genome, we designed a target region covering methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk germline variants and generated long reads with adaptive sampling run in the 22Rv1 cell line. To identify the allele-specific methylation in the 22Rv1 cell line, we performed long-read based phasing and compared the 5mCG signals between the two haplotypes. As a result, we identified 6,390 haplotype-specific methylated regions in the 22Rv1 cell line (p-MWU </= 1e-5 and delta >/= 50%). By examining haplotype-specific methylated regions near the phasing variants, we identified examples of allele-specific methylated regions that showed allelespecific accessibility in the ATAC-seq data. By further integrating the ATAC-seq data of 22Rv1, we found that methylation levels were negatively correlated with chromatin accessibility at the genome-wide scale. Our study has revealed native methylome profiling while preserving haplotype information, offering a novel approach to uncovering the regulatory mechanisms of the human prostate genome."
39386465,PRMT1 Modulates Alternative Splicing to Enhance HPV18 mRNA Stability and Promote the Establishment of Infection.,"Only persistent HPV infections lead to the development of cancer. Thus, understanding the virus-host interplay that influences the establishment of viral infection has important implications for HPV biology and human cancers. The ability of papillomaviruses to establish in cells requires the strict temporal regulation of viral gene expression in sync with cellular differentiation. This control primarily happens at the level of RNA splicing and polyadenylation. However, the details of how this spatio-temporal regulation is achieved still need to be fully understood. Until recently, it has been challenging to study the early events of the HPV lifecycle following infection. We used a single-cell genomics approach to identify cellular factors involved in viral infection and establishment. We identify protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as an important factor in viral infection of primary human cervical cells. PRMT1 is the main cellular enzyme responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of cellular proteins. PRMT1 is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the methylation of arginine residues on various proteins, which influences processes such as RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. In this study, we show that HPV18 infection leads to increased PRMT1 levels across the viral lifecycle. PRMT1 is critical for the establishment of a persistent infection in primary cells. Mechanistically, PRMT1 inhibition leads to a highly dysregulated viral splicing pattern. Specifically, reduced PRMT1 activity leads to intron retention and a change in the E6 and E7 expression ratio. In the absence of PRMT1, viral transcripts are destabilized and subject to degradation via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. These findings highlight PRMT1 as a critical regulator of the HPV18 lifecycle, particularly in RNA processing, and position it as a potential therapeutic target for persistent HPV18 infections."
39386206,Causal relationship between 150 skin microbiomes and prostate cancer: insights from bidirectional mendelian randomization and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Despite relevant research, the relationship between skin microbiomes and prostate cancer remains controversial. This study utilizes bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis combined with meta-analysis to explore the potential link between the two. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the causal relationship between 150 skin microbiomes and prostate cancer (PCa) using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis. METHODS: This study employed a comprehensive Bidirectional Two-sample MR analysis using publicly available genetic data to ascertain the relationship between 150 skin microbiomes and PCa. We conducted extensive sensitivity analyses, tests for heterogeneity, and assessments of horizontal pleiotropy to ensure the accuracy of our results. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis to strengthen our conclusions' robustness further. Finally, we performed reverse causal verification on the positive skin microbiomes and PCa. RESULTS: After conducting a meta-analysis and multiple corrections of the MR analysis results, our findings reveal a correlation between Neisseria in dry skin and PCa risk, identifying it as a risk factor. The IVW result shows an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.009 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.004-1.014, P = 0.027). Furthermore, the reverse MR analysis indicates the absence of an inverse causal relationship between the two. Apart from the identified skin microbiome, no significant associations were found between the other microbiomes and PCa. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a correlation between Neisseria in dry skin, one of the 150 skin microbiomes, and the risk of developing PCa, establishing it as a risk factor for increased susceptibility to PCa."
39385256,Single-cell analysis reveals alternations between the aged and young mice prostates.,"BACKGROUND: Aging of the male prostate is an inevitable process in which the prostate undergoes hyperplasia, and this growth may lead to compression of the urethra, resulting in voiding dysfunction and associated symptoms, and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Despite the significance of prostate aging, the molecular mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. METHODS: Prostate split by lobes from young (2 months) and aged (24 months) mice were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Tissues from both anterior prostate (AP) and ventral/dorsal/lateral prostate (VDLP) were included in the study. Data analysis included unsupervised clustering using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to identify distinct cell types based on marker gene expression. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify age-related changes in gene expression across different cell types. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to elucidate biological pathways associated with differentially expressed genes. Additionally, cellular interactions and developmental trajectories were analyzed to characterize cellular dynamics during prostate aging. RESULTS: The single-cell transcriptome analysis of the mouse prostate during aging revealed heterogeneity across various cell types and their changes during the aging process. We found a significant increase in the proportion of mesenchymal and immune cells in aged mice. Our study unveiled alterations in genes and pathways associated with cellular senescence, oxidative stress, and regeneration in epithelial cells. Furthermore, we observed that basal cells may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to become mesenchymal cells, particularly prominent in aged mice. Additionally, immune cells, notably macrophages and T cells, exhibited a heightened inflammatory response in aged mice. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study provides a comparative analysis of the single-cell transcriptome of the aged and young mice prostates, elucidating cellular and molecular changes between the aged and young mice prostates."
39384879,Polygenic risk and rare variant gene clustering enhance cancer risk stratification for breast and prostate cancers.,"Polygenic risk score (PRS) and rare monogenic variant screening are valuable tools for predicting cancer risk and identifying individuals at high risk. Integrating both common and rare genetic variants is crucial for accurate risk assessment. However, estimating the impacts of rare variants on cancer and combining them with PRS remains challenging. Here, we analyze 454,711 exome sequencing and 487,409 array UK Biobank samples, focusing on breast and prostate cancers. We introduce an expanded PRS (EPRS) approach, yielding a systematic model for more effective risk stratification. By prioritizing and clustering genes with cancer-specific rare variants based on odds ratios and population-attributable fraction, we refine risk stratification by combining both monogenic and polygenic effects. Individuals in high-PRS groups with rare high-impact gene variants show up to 15- and 22-fold higher risk for breast and prostate cancers, respectively, compared to those in the intermediate-PRS groups without rare variants. Combined risk profiles vary across distinct rare variant clusters within the same PRS group for both cancers. Our EPRS approach enhances risk stratification for breast and prostate cancers, offering important insights for future research and potential applications to other cancer types."
39384146,Sodium selenite inhibits cervical cancer progression via ROS-mediated suppression of glucose metabolic reprogramming.,"AIMS: This study aims to explore the inhibitory effect of selenium on cervical cancer through suppression of glucose metabolic reprogramming and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Sodium selenite (SS) treated HeLa and SiHa cells were assessed for proliferation using the CCK-8 assay and immunofluorescence. DNA synthesis was measured with the EdU assay. A nude mouse xenograft model evaluated SS's anti-cervical cancer effects. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured using flow cytometry, DCFH-DA, and JC-1 probes, respectively. Apoptosis was detected via Annexin V/PI staining and Western blot. Glucose uptake, lactate production, and ATP generation were determined using 2-NBDG probes and assay kits. The mRNA and protein levels of glycolysis-related genes HK2, GLUT1, and PDK1 were measured using RT-qPCR and Western blot. KEY FINDINGS: SS inhibited HeLa and SiHa cells viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal injection of SS in nude mice significantly inhibited HeLa cell xenograft growth without evident hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity. SS inhibited glucose metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells primarily via ROS-mediated AKT/mTOR/HIF-1alpha pathway inhibition. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or MHY1485 (an mTOR activator) partially reversed the inhibitory effects of SS on glucose metabolic reprogramming, cell proliferation, and migration, as well as its pro-apoptotic effects. SIGNIFICANCE: SS exhibited anti-cervical cancer effects, likely through the induction of ROS generation and inhibition of glucose metabolic reprogramming in cervical cancer cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SS for potential new drug development for cervical cancer."
39383365,The ethanolic extract of Gomphrena celosioides is not carcinogenic and has antigenotoxic effects and chemopreventive Properties.,"Gomphrena celosioides, popularly known as perpetua, perpetua brava, bachelor s button and prostate globe amarahth, is used for the treatment of urinary tract disorders, kidney stones, for skin diseases, infectious diseases, gastrointestinal and respiratory conditions. Rich in phenolic acids and flavonoids, this plant has therefore a potential for use in cancer prevention. Given the above, the present research aimed to evaluate the carcinogenic effect of the ethanolic extract of G. celosioides (EEGc) in an alternative model of Drosophila melanogaster and the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects in Swiss mice. The larval survival test and the detection of epithelial tumor clones were performed in D. melanogaster. The tested EEGc concentrations were 0.96, 1.92, 3.85 and 7.70 mg/mL. In Swiss mice, the genotoxicity and antigenotoxicity of doses of 100, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/Kg were evaluated. The results showed that EEGc at a concentration of 7.70 mg/mL reduced (p<0.05) larval survival. However, EEGc was not carcinogenic, and the lowest concentration (0.96 mg/mL) prevented (p<0.05) the basal occurrence of epithelial tumors. In mice, EEGc at the highest dose (2,000mg/Kg) increased the frequency of genomic lesions (p<0.05). Yet, none of the doses caused chromosomal lesions (p>0.05). When associated with cyclophosphamide, EEGc was antigenotoxic (p<0.05). The percentages of reduction of genomic damage ranged from 33.39 to 63.23% and of chromosomal damage from 20.00 to 77.19%. In view of the above, it is suggested that EEGc is not carcinogenic, has an antigenotoxic effect and chemopreventive properties."
39383000,Functional inversion of circadian regulator REV-ERBalpha leads to tumorigenic gene reprogramming.,"Profound functional switch of key regulatory factors may play a major role in homeostasis and disease. Dysregulation of circadian rhythm (CR) is strongly implicated in cancer with mechanisms poorly understood. We report here that the function of REV-ERBalpha, a major CR regulator of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, is dramatically altered in tumors in both its genome binding and functional mode. Loss of CR is linked to a functional inversion of REV-ERBalpha from a repressor in control of CR and metabolic gene programs in normal tissues to a strong activator in different cancers. Through changing its association from NCoR/HDAC3 corepressor complex to BRD4/p300 coactivators, REV-ERBalpha directly activates thousands of genes including tumorigenic programs such as MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling. Functioning as a master transcriptional activator, REV-ERBalpha partners with pioneer factor FOXA1 and directly stimulates a large number of signaling genes, including multiple growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, RASs, AKTs, and MAPKs. Moreover, elevated REV-ERBalpha reprograms FOXA1 to bind new targets through a BRD4-mediated increase in local chromatin accessibility. Pharmacological targeting with SR8278 diminishes the function of both REV-ERBalpha and FOXA1 and synergizes with BRD4 inhibitor in effective suppression of tumorigenic programs and tumor growth. Thus, our study revealed a functional inversion by a CR regulator in driving gene reprogramming as an unexpected paradigm of tumorigenesis mechanism and demonstrated a high effectiveness of therapeutic targeting such switch."
39382632,Loss of PI5P4Kalpha Slows the Progression of a Pten Mutant Basal Cell Model of Prostate Cancer.,"Although early prostate cancer depends on the androgen receptor signaling pathway, which is predominant in luminal cells, there is much to be understood about the contribution of epithelial basal cells in cancer progression. Herein, we observe cell type-specific differences in the importance of the metabolic enzyme phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase alpha (PI5P4Kalpha; gene name PIP4K2A) in the prostate epithelium. We report the development of a basal cell-specific genetically engineered mouse model targeting Pip4k2a alone or in combination with the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten). PI5P4Kalpha is enriched in basal cells, and no major histopathologic changes were detectable following gene deletion. Notably, the combined loss of Pip4k2a slowed the development of Pten mutant mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Through the inclusion of a lineage tracing reporter, we utilize single-cell RNA sequencing to evaluate changes resulting from in vivo downregulation of Pip4k2a and characterize cell populations influenced in the established Probasin-Cre- and cytokeratin 5-Cre-driven genetically engineered mouse model. Transcriptomic pathway analysis points toward the disruption of lipid metabolism as a mechanism for reduced tumor progression. This was functionally supported by shifts of carnitine lipids in LNCaP prostate cancer cells treated with siPIP4K2A. Overall, these data nominate PI5P4Kalpha as a target for PTEN mutant prostate cancer. Implications: PI5P4Kalpha is enriched in prostate basal cells, and its targeted loss slows the progression of a model of advanced prostate cancer."
39380268,Early detection of cervical tumor cell of origin through Oncogene-induced senescent HPV-positive cells.,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is an oncogenic virus and is the most common cause of cervical cancer. HPV has been shown to induce senescence. Cellular senescence is involved in cancer progression and tumorigenesis. Identification and isolation of cells of tumor origin before tumorigeneses is an important step in cancer prevention and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the early cervical atypical senescent cytological preneoplastic change in non-menopausal women. Cervical smears of 121 patients were randomly selected and included in the study which cytopathologically diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (AS-CUS) in correlation to HPV status, parakeratosis (PK), p16 immunostaining, enlarged Squamous cells nuclei (ES) and inflammatory cells infiltration (ICI). Results revealed that out of the total 121 patients, 32 cases (26%) were positive for high-risk HPV (HR-HPV), 26 cases (22%) were positive for low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) and 63 (52%) were negative for HPV. HPV infections were significantly associated with age groups (p<0.026), PK (p = 0.043), p16 (p = 0.001), ES (p = 0.002) and ICI (p = 0.049). The positive immunostaining expression of p16 was only noticed in two HR-HPV patients. ES cells were found in 9.5% of HPV-negative cases, 27% of LR-HPV cases and 40.5% of HR-HPV cases. High PK cell positivity was seen only in HR-HPV. High ICI scores were seen in 40.6% of HR-HPV patients, 26.9 % of LR-HPV and 17.4 % of negative HPV patients. It was concluded that high PK positivity, high ICI score, positive p16 immunostaining and ES were correlated with HR-HPV in non-menopausal women. These findings could provide potential diagnostic clues for HPV-harboring senescent cells as a strategy for reducing HPV risk of cervical cancer development and identifying the cell of tumor origin, which could be beneficial for improving the utility of senolytic agents and immunotherapy in clinical practice."
39379982,Prediction of homologous recombination deficiency from routine histology with attention-based multiple instance learning in nine different tumor types.,"BACKGROUND: Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is recognized as a pan-cancer predictive biomarker that potentially indicates who could benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Despite its clinical significance, HRD testing is highly complex. Here, we investigated in a proof-of-concept study whether Deep Learning (DL) can predict HRD status solely based on routine hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) histology images across nine different cancer types. METHODS: We developed a deep learning pipeline with attention-weighted multiple instance learning (attMIL) to predict HRD status from histology images. As part of our approach, we calculated a genomic scar HRD score by combining loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LST) from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of n = 5209 patients across two independent cohorts. The model's effectiveness was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), focusing on its accuracy in predicting genomic HRD against a clinically recognized cutoff value. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated the predictability of genomic HRD status in endometrial, pancreatic, and lung cancers reaching cross-validated AUROCs of 0.79, 0.58, and 0.66, respectively. These predictions generalized well to an external cohort, with AUROCs of 0.93, 0.81, and 0.73. Moreover, a breast cancer-trained image-based HRD classifier yielded an AUROC of 0.78 in the internal validation cohort and was able to predict HRD in endometrial, prostate, and pancreatic cancer with AUROCs of 0.87, 0.84, and 0.67, indicating that a shared HRD-like phenotype occurs across these tumor entities. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes that HRD can be directly predicted from H&E slides using attMIL, demonstrating its applicability across nine different tumor types."
39379919,Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that NEAT1 was a potential biomarker and therapeutic target of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) usually manifests atypical symptoms in the early stage, and once symptoms appear, most PCa patients have developed to the advanced stage, failing to undergo radical surgery. In this study, PCa occurrence-related biomarkers were explored based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. METHODS: scRNA-seq data of prostate normal (Normal), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and PCa (Tumor) samples were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Cellular subsets associated with PCa occurrence were obtained using cell annotation. Additionally, the mRNA expression of nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effects of NEAT1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and flow cytometry. Subsequently, cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models were constructed and divided into the LV-NC and LV-shNEAT1 groups. After the tumor tissues of CDX model mice in each group were extracted, the cell growth and Ki67 expression were observed separately using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Ten cellular subsets were obtained via cell annotation, and significantly differential changes were observed between Basal intermediate and Luminal during the course of BPH to PCa. NEAT1(-)Luminal was highly recruited in the Tumor group with low stemness and high malignancy scores. Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7)(-) keratin 17 (KRT17)(-)Basal intermediate had high ratios in the Tumor group with low stemness and high malignancy scores. The results of pseudotime analysis revealed that NEAT1(-)Luminal in the Tumor group were consistently distributed with tumor stage cells. In vitro assays showed that NEAT1 expression was elevated in PCa cells, and NEAT1 knockdown could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. CDX assays indicated that silencing NEAT1 could reduce the growth rate of PCa tumor volume in CDX model mice. H&E staining results showed that nuclei of tumor cells were reduced and exhibited lighter color in the LV-shNEAT1 group compared with the LV-NC group. IHC results showed that Ki67 positivity was significantly lower in the LV-shNEAT1 group than in the LV-NC group. CONCLUSION: NEAT1 expression is increased in PCa, and NEAT1 can be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa."
39379238,Impact of Gene Expression Classifier Testing on Adjuvant Treatment Following Radical Prostatectomy: The G-MINOR Prospective Randomized Cluster-crossover Trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Decipher is a tissue-based genomic classifier (GC) developed and validated in the post-radical prostatectomy (RP) setting as a predictor of metastasis. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled cluster-crossover trial assessing the use of Decipher to determine its impact on adjuvant treatment after RP. METHODS: Eligible patients had undergone RP within 9 mo of enrollment, had pT3-4 disease and/or positive surgical margins, and prostate-specific antigen <0.1 ng/ml. Centers were randomized to a sequence of 3-mo periods of either GC-informed care or usual care (UC). Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) recurrence risk scores were provided to treating physicians and patients in all periods. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Impact of GC test results on adjuvant treatment were compared with UC alone. Longitudinal patient-reported urinary and sexual function was assessed. A total of 175 patients were enrolled in 27 periods with GC and 163 in 28 periods with UC. At 18 mo after RP, an average patient in the GC arm received adjuvant treatment 9.7% of the time compared with 8.7% for an average individual in the UC arm (0.99% mean difference, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.6%, 9.6%, p = 0.8). While controlling for CAPRA-S score, higher GC scores tended to result in an increased likelihood of adjuvant treatment that was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35 per 0.1 increase in GC score, 95% CI 0.98-1.85, p = 0.066). Using the GC risk groups, reflecting clinical use, a high GC risk was associated with significantly higher odds of receiving adjuvant treatment (OR = 6.9, 95% CI 1.8, 26, p = 0.005) compared with a low GC score, adjusted for CAPRA-S score. There were no differences in patient-reported urinary and sexual function between the study arms. As oncologic outcomes are immature, the present data cannot address whether GC testing provides any cancer control benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: GC testing impacts adjuvant therapy administration when viewed through the risk categories presented in the patient report; however, these data do not provide specific support for GC testing in the adjuvant treatment setting."
39378549,Unraveling the mechanisms of RECQL4-mediated cervical cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT pathway.,"BACKGROUND: RECQL4 is a member of the DNA helicase family and is critical for DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and tumor progression. However, its specific role in cervical cancer remains uncertain. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of RECQL4 on cervical cancer prognosis using clinical specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We evaluated the malignant effects of RECQL4 through various experimental assays including cell Cell Counting Kit-8, EdU, colony formation, cell cycle analysis, cell apoptosis, scratch, and Transwell assays. We explored the mechanisms of RECQL4-regulated malignancy using analyses of bioinformatics, RNA sequencing data, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting, and cell immunofluorescence experiments. Furthermore, we validated the effects of RECQL4 knockdown on tumor growth using subcutaneous tumor models in nude mice. RESULTS: RECQL4 was upregulated in cervical cancer and correlated with prognosis, demonstrating a positive relationship with tumor mutational burden. Knockdown of RECQL4 inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition status, induces cell cycle arrest, and promotes apoptosis. Mechanistically, RECQL4 mediated malignancy through the PI3K/AKT pathway and reduced nuclear beta-catenin expression. In vivo studies further confirmed that RECQL4 knockout significantly inhibited tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism behind RECQL4-mediated cervical cancer progression through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, our study suggests potential therapeutic strategies for targeting RECQL4 in cervical cancer treatment."
39374015,Circulating Tumor Cell Count and Overall Survival in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.,"IMPORTANCE: In metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), new first-line combination therapies have enhanced overall survival (OS), but clinical outcomes for individual patients vary greatly and are difficult to predict. Peripheral blood circulating tumor cell (CTC) count is the most extensively validated prognostic liquid biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and recent studies have suggested that it may also be informative in mHSPC. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic value of CTC count in men with mHSPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this prognostic study, peripheral blood was drawn at registration (baseline) and at progression to mCRPC in the S1216 study (March 1, 2013, to July 15, 2017), a phase 3, prospective, randomized clinical trial in men with mHSPC. The CTCs were enumerated using a US Food and Drug Administration-cleared isolation platform. Counts were categorized as 0, 1 to 4, or 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL based on the prognostic value of these cut points in prior studies. The data analysis was performed between October 28, 2022, and June 15, 2023. EXPOSURE: Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Circulating tumor cell count was evaluated for an association with 3 prespecified trial end points: OS, progression-free survival, and 7-month prostate-specific antigen, after adjusting for other baseline covariates using proportional hazards and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of 1313 S1216 participants (median [IQR] age, 68 [44-92] years), evaluable samples from 503 (median [IQR] age, 69 [46-90] years) with newly diagnosed mHSPC were collected at baseline, and 93 samples were collected at progression. Baseline counts were 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL in 60 samples (11.9%), 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 107 samples (21.3%), and 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL in 336 samples (66.8%). Median OS for men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL was 27.9 months (95% CI, 24.1-31.2 months) compared with 56.2 months (95% CI, 45.7-69.8 months) for men with 1 to 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL and not reached at 78.0 months follow-up for men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL. After adjusting for baseline clinical covariates, men with 5 or more CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline had a significantly higher hazard of death (hazard ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.22-4.68) and disease progression (hazard ratio, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.76-3.43) and a lower likelihood of prostate-specific antigen complete response (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54) compared with men with 0 CTCs per 7.5 mL at baseline. Adding baseline CTC count to other known prognostic factors (covariates only: area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79) resulted in an increased prognostic value for 3-year survival (area under the curve, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, the findings validate CTC count as a prognostic biomarker that improved upon existing prognostic factors and estimated vastly divergent survival outcomes regardless of subsequent lines of therapy. As such, baseline CTC count in mHSPC may serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to identify men likely to have poor survival who may benefit from clinical trials of intensified or novel regimens."
39372720,Identification of 10 differentially expressed genes involved in the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer via next-generation sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer remain high in female malignant tumors worldwide. There is still a lack of diagnostic and prognostic markers for cervical carcinoma. This study aimed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and cervical cancer tissues to identify candidate genes for further research. METHODS: Uterine cervical specimens were resected from our clinical patients after radical hysterectomy. Three patients' transcriptomic datasets were built by the next generation sequencing (NGS) results. DEGs were selected through the edgeR and DESeq2 packages in the R environment. Functional enrichment analysis, including GO/DisGeNET/KEGG/Reactome enrichment analysis, was performed. Normal and cervical cancer tissue data from the public databases TCGA and GTEx were collected to compare the expression levels of 10 selected DEGs in tumor and normal tissues. ROC curve and survival analysis were performed to compare the diagnostic and prognostic values of each gene. The expression levels of candidate genes were verified in 15 paired clinical specimens via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: There were 875 up-regulated and 1,482 down-regulated genes in cervical cancer samples compared with the paired adjacent normal cervical tissues according to the NGS analysis. The top 10 DEGs included APOD, MASP1, ACKR1, C1QTNF7, SFRP4, HSPB6, GSTM5, IGFBP6, F10 and DCN. GO, DisGeNET and Reactome analyses revealed that the DEGs were related to extracellular matrix and angiogenesis which might influence tumorigenesis. KEGG enrichment showed that PI3K-Akt signaling pathway might be involved in cervical cancer tumorigenesis and progression. The expression levels of selected genes were decreased in tumors in both the public database and our experimental clinical specimens. All the candidate genes showed excellent diagnostic value, and the AUC values exceeded 0.90. Additionally, APOD, ACKR1 and SFRP4 expression levels could help predict the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we selected the top 10 DEGs which were down-regulated in cervical cancer tissues. All of them had dramatically diagnostic value. APOD, ACKR1 and SFRP4 were associated with the survivals of cervical cancer. C1QTNF7, HSPB6, GSTM5, IGFBP6 and F10 were first reported to be candidate genes of cervical carcinoma."
39372390,Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in human cancer: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.,"Neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NEtD), also commonly referred to as lineage plasticity, emerges as an acquired resistance mechanism to molecular targeted therapies in multiple cancer types, predominately occurs in metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with androgen receptor targeting therapies. NEtD tumors are the lethal cancer histologic subtype with unfavorable prognosis and limited treatment. A comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanism underlying targeted-induced plasticity could greatly facilitate the development of novel therapies. In the past few years, increasingly elegant studies indicated that NEtD tumors share key the convergent genomic and phenotypic characteristics irrespective of their site of origin, but also embrace distinct change and function of molecular mechanisms. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of molecular mechanism in regulating the NEtD, including genetic alterations, DNA methylation, histone modifications, dysregulated noncoding RNA, lineage-specific transcription factors regulation, and other proteomic alterations. We also provide the current management of targeted therapies in clinical and preclinical practice."
39371943,Causal relationship between genetic-predicted uric acid and cervical cancer risk: evidence for nutritional intervention on cervical cancer prevention.,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and cervical cancer is inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the causal relationship between SUA levels and cervical cancer incidence, and to evaluate the potential role of nutritional interventions in cervical cancer prevention. METHODS: We conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic instruments from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of individuals of predominantly European ancestry. Methods such as inversevariance weighted, weighted-median, weighted model, and MR-Egger were applied. Sensitivity tests, including leave-one-out, MR-PRESSO, and Cochran's Q test, assessed heterogeneity and pleiotropy. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that a high SUA concentration significantly increased the risk of malignant cervical cancer: a 1 mg/mL increase in SUA was associated with a 71% higher risk (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.10-2.67; p = 0.018). Stratification by histological type showed a significant causal effect on cervical adenocarcinoma risk (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.14-5.73; p = 0.023). However, no clear evidence was found for a causal effect of cervical cancer on SUA levels. CONCLUSION: This study identified a causal relationship between elevated SUA levels and the risk of malignant cervical cancer, particularly cervical adenocarcinoma. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cervical carcinogenesis and suggest that managing SUA levels could be a potential strategy for cervical cancer prevention through dietary management."
39371170,Genomic ascertainment of CHEK2-related cancer predisposition.,"PURPOSE: There is clear evidence that deleterious germline variants in CHEK2 increases risk for breast and prostate cancers; there is limited or conflicting evidence for other cancers. Genomic ascertainment was used to quantify cancer risk in CHEK2 germline pathogenic variant heterozygotes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Germline CHEK2 variants were extracted from two exome-sequenced biobanks linked to the electronic health record: UK Biobank (n= 469,765) and Geisinger MyCode (n=170,503). Variants were classified as per American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) criteria. Heterozygotes harbored a CHEK2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant; controls harbored benign/likely benign CHEK2 variation or wildtype CHEK2. Tumor phenotype and demographic data were retrieved; to adjust for relatedness, association analysis was performed with SAIGE-GENE+ with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: In CHEK2 heterozygotes in both MyCode and UK Biobank, there was a significant excess risk of all cancers tested, including breast cancer (C50; OR=1.54 and 1.84, respectively), male genital organ cancer (C60-C63; OR=1.61 and 1.77 respectively), urinary tract cancer (C64-C68; OR=1.56 and 1.75, respectively) and lymphoid, hematopoietic, and related tissue cancer (C81-C96; OR=1.42 and 2.11, respectively). Compared to controls, age-dependent cancer penetrance in CHEK2 heterozygotes was significantly younger in both cohorts; no significant difference was observed between the penetrance of truncating and missense variants for cancer in either cohort. Overall survival was significantly decreased in CHEK2 heterozygotes in UK Biobank but there was no statistical difference in MyCode. CONCLUSION: Using genomic ascertainment in two population-scale cohorts, this investigation quantified the prevalence, penetrance, cancer phenotype and survival in CHEK2 heterozygotes. Tailored treatment options and surveillance strategies to manage those risks are warranted."
39371096,Association between autoimmunity-related disorders and prostate cancer: A Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Although many epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have reported an association between autoimmune disorders and prostate cancer, none has reported a clear correlation or the direction of the association. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential relationship between autoimmunity-related disorders and prostate cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: We retrieved literature from PubMed using the keywords ""autoimmune disorder"" AND ""prostate cancer"" to find more clues on the correlation between prostate cancer and autoimmunity-related disorder. Based on this literature search, we selected 16 autoimmunity-related disorders that had genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and may be associated with prostate cancer. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was applied as our primary analysis for two-sample MR and multivariate MR analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We further verified the robustness of our conclusions using a series of sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The autoimmunity-related diseases selected include rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, coxarthrosis, gonarthrosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hyperthyroidism, psoriatic arthropathies, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The results of inverse variance weighting (IVW suggested that six diseases were associated with the development of prostate cancer. The three diseases that may increase the risk of prostate cancer are rheumatoid arthritis (P = 0.001), coxarthrosis (P < 0.001), and gonarthrosis (P = 0.008). The three possible protective factors against prostate cancer are primary sclerosing cholangitis (P = 0.001), autoimmune hyperthyroidism (P = 0.011), and psoriatic arthropathies (P = 0.001). Horizontal pleiotropy was not observed in the MR-Egger test. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide predictive genetic evidence for an association between autoimmune disorders and prostate cancer. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of comorbidities at the molecular level."
39370734,Translation Initiation Factor-2S2 (eIF2S2) Contributes to Cervical Carcinogenesis by Inhibiting the TGF-beta/SMAD4 Signaling Pathway.,"The deregulation of protein translational machinery and the oncogenic role of several translation initiation factors have been extensively investigated. This study aimed to investigate the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2S2 (eIF2S2, also known as eIF2beta) in cervical carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of human cervical carcinoma tissues revealed a stage-specific increase in eIF2S2 expression. The knockdown of eIF2S2 in human cervical cancer (SiHa) cells significantly reduced growth and migration properties, whereas its overexpression demonstrated the opposite effect. Immunoprecipitation and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay confirmed the previous photo array finding of the interaction between eIF2S2 and SMAD4 to understand the tumorigenic mechanism of eIF2S2. The results indicated that the N-terminus of eIF2S2 interacts with the MH-1 domain of SMAD4. The interaction effect between eIF2S2 and SMAD4 was further evaluated. The knockdown of eIF2S2 increased SMAD4 expression in cervical cancer cells without changing SMAD4 mRNA expression, whereas transient eIF2S2 overexpression reduced SMAD4 expression. This indicates the possibility of post-translational regulation of SMAD4 expression by eIF2S2. Additionally, eIF2S2 overexpression was confirmed to weaken the expression and/or promoter activity of p15 and p27, which are SMAD4-regulated antiproliferative proteins, by reducing SMAD4 levels. Therefore, our study indicated the pro-tumorigenic role of eIF2S2, which diminishes both SMAD4 expression and function as a transcriptional factor in cervical carcinogenesis."
39369133,Single-Hit and Multi-hit PIK3CA Short Variant Genomic Alterations in Clinically Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Genomic Landscape Study.,"BACKGROUND: Tumors harboring two or more PIK3CA short variant (SV) (""multi-hit"") mutations have been linked to improved outcomes with anti-PIK3CA-targeted therapies in breast cancer. The landscape and clinical implications of multi-hit PIK3CA alterations in clinically advanced prostate cancer (CAPC) remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the genomic landscape of single-hit and multi-hit PIK3CA genomic alterations in CAPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Foundation Medicine FoundationCore database was used to identify 19,978 CAPC tumors that underwent hybrid capture-based comprehensive genomic profiling to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) and determine tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), genomic ancestry, single-base substitution mutational signatures, and homologous recombination deficiency signature (HRDsig). Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). RESULTS: 18,741 (93.8%) tumors were PIK3CA wild type (WT), 1155 (5.8%) featured single PIK3CA SV, and 82 (0.4%) featured multi-hit PIK3CA SVs. Single-hit (6.6 versus 3.8; p < 0.0001) and multi-hit (12.8 versus 3.8; p < 0.0001) featured more driver GA per tumor than PIK3CA WT CAPC, as well as higher prevalence of MMR mutational signature, MSI high status, and TMB levels versus PIK3CA WT (p < 0.0001). Other differences in GA included higher frequencies of GA in BRCA2 in multi-hit versus WT (18.3% versus 8.5%; p = 0.0191), ATM in multi-hit versus WT (13.4% versus 5.6%; p = 0.02) and PTEN in single-hit versus WT (40.2% versus 30.1%; p < 0.0001). Homologous recombination deficiency signatures were higher in PIK3CA WT versus single-hit (11.2% versus 7.6%; p = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in PD-L1 expression among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of multi-hit PIK3CA GA in CAPC highlights a potentially unique phenotype that may be associated with response to anti-PIK3CA targeted therapy and checkpoint inhibition, supporting relevant clinical trial designs."
39368479,"CDK12 loss drives prostate cancer progression, transcription-replication conflicts, and synthetic lethality with paralog CDK13.","Biallelic loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) defines a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) subtype. It remains unclear, however, whether CDK12 loss drives prostate cancer (PCa) development or uncovers pharmacologic vulnerabilities. Here, we show Cdk12 ablation in murine prostate epithelium is sufficient to induce preneoplastic lesions with lymphocytic infiltration. In allograft-based CRISPR screening, Cdk12 loss associates positively with Trp53 inactivation but negatively with Pten inactivation. Moreover, concurrent Cdk12/Trp53 ablation promotes proliferation of prostate-derived organoids, while Cdk12 knockout in Pten-null mice abrogates prostate tumor growth. In syngeneic systems, Cdk12/Trp53-null allografts exhibit luminal morphology and immune checkpoint blockade sensitivity. Mechanistically, Cdk12 inactivation mediates genomic instability by inducing transcription-replication conflicts. Strikingly, CDK12-mutant organoids and patient-derived xenografts are sensitive to inhibition or degradation of the paralog kinase, CDK13. We therein establish CDK12 as a bona fide tumor suppressor, mechanistically define how CDK12 inactivation causes genomic instability, and advance a therapeutic strategy for CDK12-mutant mCRPC."
39367907,Stabilization of RRBP1 mRNA via an m(6)A-dependent manner in prostate cancer constitutes a therapeutic vulnerability amenable to small-peptide inhibition of METTL3.,"Mounting evidence has implicated the RNA m(6)A methylation catalyzed by METTL3 in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. The detailed m(6)A landscape and molecular mechanism of METTL3 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains ill-defined. We find that METTL3 is overexpressed in PCa and correlates with worse patient survival. Functional studies establish METTL3 as an oncoprotein dependent on its m(6)A enzymatic activity in both AR(+) and AR(-) PCa cells. To dissect the regulatory network of m(6)A pathway in PCa, we map the m(6)A landscape in clinical tumor samples using m(6)A-seq and identify genome-wide METTL3-binding transcripts via RIP-seq. Mechanistically, we discover RRBP1 as a direct METTL3 target in which METTL3 stabilizes RRBP1 mRNA in an m(6)A-dependent manner. RRBP1 positively correlates with METTL3 expression in PCa cohorts and exerts an oncogenic role in aggressive PCa cells. Leveraging the 3D structural protein-protein interaction between METTL3 and METTL14, we successfully develop two potential METTL3 peptide inhibitors (RM3 and RSM3) that effectively suppress cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, our study reveals a novel METTL3/m(6)A/RRBP1 axis in enhancing aggressive traits of PCa, which can be therapeutically targeted by small-peptide METTL3 antagonists."
39366729,Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4.30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. METHODS: In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. FINDINGS: Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28.5% (95% UI 27.9-29.1) among males and 5.96% (5.76-6.21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25.9% (25.2-26.6) among males, and 30.0% (26.1-32.1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29.3 billion (95% UI 26.8-32.4) overall YLLs among males and 22.2 billion (20.1-24.6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73.6 years (95% UI 72.8-74.4) in 2022 to 78.3 years (75.9-80.3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2.04 billion (95% UI 1.90-2.21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77.6 years (95% UI 75.1-79.6) among males and 81.0 years (78.5-83.1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77.1 years (95% UI 74.6-79.0) among males and 80.8 years (78.3-82.9) among females. INTERPRETATION: Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

39365544,Predictors of brain metastases in patients with oligometastatic solid tumours treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy.,"PURPOSE: In patients with oligometastatic disease (OMD) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), those who develop brain metastases (BrM) may have poor outcomes. We aimed to investigate variables associated with BrM development in this population. METHODS: Patients with </= 5 extracranial metastases from solid tumors treated with SBRT from 2008 to 2016 at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre were included. We investigated the association between covariates and CIBrM (cumulative incidence of BrM) using Fine-Gray analysis, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox regression. We investigated the association between extracranial progression and CIBrM using time-based conditional analysis. RESULTS: Among 404 patients, the most common primary sites were lung, colorectal, prostate, breast and kidney. Median follow-up was 49 months. Median PFS was 25 months. Median OS was 70 months. 58 patients developed BrM, and 5-year CIBrM was 16%. On multivariable analysis, number of extracranial metastases, location of metastases, total planning target volume (PTV), and time from primary diagnosis to OMD were not associated with CIBrM, although several of these variables were associated with extracranial PFS and OS. Primary site was associated with CIBrM, with colorectal and prostate cancer associated with lower CIBrM compared to lung cancer. Widespread extracranial progression (>/= 5 sites) within 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of OMD diagnosis was independently associated with higher CIBrM. CONCLUSION: In patients with OMD treated with SBRT, baseline variables related to extracranial disease burden and distribution were not associated with BrM development, while primary site and widespread extracranial progression were associated with BrM development."
39365488,Identification of KLHL17 as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer based on single-cell sequencing and in vitro/in vivo experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men, characterized by significant heterogeneity that complicates diagnosis and treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: To enhance our understanding of PCa, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify distinct malignant epithelial cell subpopulations and their molecular characteristics. By integrating scRNA-seq data with bulk RNA-seq data, we constructed a prognostic risk score model. The influence of key genes identified in the risk score on PCa was validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our study revealed eight unique malignant epithelial cell clusters, each exhibiting distinct molecular characteristics and biological functions. KEGG and GO enrichment analyses highlighted their involvement in various pathways. The prognostic risk score model demonstrated strong predictive power for patient outcomes, particularly in predicting progression-free survival (PFS). Notably, KLHL17, identified as a high-risk gene, was found to significantly impact PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis upon knockdown. This finding was further validated in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model, where reduced KLHL17 expression led to decreased tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our research provides a comprehensive analysis of PCa heterogeneity and highlights KLHL17 as a potential therapeutic target."
39364316,No genetic causal relationship between acne and prostate cancer through Mendelian randomization combined with meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies regarding the relationship between acne and prostate cancer have reported inconsistent results. As such studies are prone to biases, we conducted this Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to better explore the causal association between acne and prostate cancer. METHODS: The genetic data for assessing acne were acquired from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of acne by far, and the genetic data for assessing prostate cancer were acquired from the FinnGen consortium, UK Biobank, European Bioinformatics Institute, and IEU OpenGWAS project. We performed two-sample MR analyses using data from these GWASs followed by a meta-analysis to provide an overall evaluation. The primary MR methods used included inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median. Leave-one-out sensitivity tests, Cochran's Q tests, and MR-Egger intercept tests were used to bolster the robustness of the MR results. RESULTS: Through MR combined with meta-analysis, our study found no genetic causal relationship between acne and prostate cancer (p=0.378; odds ratio=0.985; 95% confidence interval, 0.954-1.018). Sensitivity tests ensured the robustness of this result. CONCLUSION: Acne should not be considered as a morbidity hazard factor for prostate cancer."
39363636,Vitamin A Metabolism and Resistance of Hepatic Metastases to Immunotherapy.,"The liver is an immune-tolerant organ, allowing for organ transplantation with less immune suppression compared with other organs. It also provides fertile soil for tumor metastases, which tend to be more resistant to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy than metastases in other organs. This resistance may result from the sum of incremental evolutionary adaptions in various cell types to prevent overaction to antigens absorbed from the gut into the portal circulation or it might involve a central mechanism. Here, we propose that metabolism of vitamin A, which is highly concentrated in the liver, is a root source of tolerance and resistance of hepatic metastases to checkpoint blockade. Suppression of retinoic acid synthesis from vitamin A with disulfiram may mitigate tolerance and produce enhanced immunotherapy treatment results for patients with liver metastases."
39363320,Deciphering resistance mechanisms in cancer: final report of MATCH-R study with a focus on molecular drivers and PDX development.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the resistance mechanisms of tumor is crucial for advancing cancer therapies. The prospective MATCH-R trial (NCT02517892), led by Gustave Roussy, aimed to characterize resistance mechanisms to cancer treatments through molecular analysis of fresh tumor biopsies. This report presents the genomic data analysis of the MATCH-R study conducted from 2015 to 2022 and focuses on targeted therapies. METHODS: The study included resistant metastatic patients (pts) who accepted an image-guided tumor biopsy. After evaluation of tumor content (TC) in frozen tissue biopsies, targeted NGS (10 < TC < 30%) or Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA sequencing (TC > 30%) were performed before and/or after the anticancer therapy. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established by implanting tumor fragments into NOD scid gamma mice and amplified up to five passages. RESULTS: A total of 1,120 biopsies were collected from 857 pts with the most frequent tumor types being lung (38.8%), digestive (16.3%) and prostate (14.1%) cancer. Molecular targetable driver were identified in 30.9% (n = 265/857) of the patients, with EGFR (41.5%), FGFR2/3 (15.5%), ALK (11.7%), BRAF (6.8%), and KRAS (5.7%) being the most common altered genes. Furthermore, 66.0% (n = 175/265) had a biopsy at progression on targeted therapy. Among resistant cases, 41.1% (n = 72/175) had no identified molecular mechanism, 32.0% (n = 56/175) showed on-target resistance, and 25.1% (n = 44/175) exhibited a by-pass resistance mechanism. Molecular profiling of the 44 patients with by-pass resistance identified 51 variants, with KRAS (13.7%), PIK3CA (11.8%), PTEN (11.8%), NF2 (7.8%), AKT1 (5.9%), and NF1 (5.9%) being the most altered genes. Treatment was tailored for 45% of the patients with a resistance mechanism identified leading to an 11 months median extension of clinical benefit. A total of 341 biopsies were implanted in mice, successfully establishing 136 PDX models achieving a 39.9% success rate. PDX models are available for EGFR (n = 31), FGFR2/3 (n = 26), KRAS (n = 18), ALK (n = 16), BRAF (n = 6) and NTRK (n = 2) driven cancers. These models closely recapitulate the biology of the original tumors in term of molecular alterations and pharmacological status, and served as valuable models to validate overcoming treatment strategies. CONCLUSION: The MATCH-R study highlights the feasibility of on purpose image guided tumor biopsies and PDX establishment to characterize resistance mechanisms and guide personalized therapies to improve outcomes in pre-treated metastatic patients."
39362459,Low level exposure to BDE-47 facilitates the development of prostate cancer through TOP2A/LDHA/lactylation positive feedback circuit.,"2,2',4,4'-tetra brominated diphenyl ether (BDE-47) is one of the most widely distributed congeners of polybrominated diphenyl ethers. While the relationships between BDE-47 exposure and other hormone-dependent cancers (such as breast cancer) are well established, no previous study has examined whether BDE-47 exposure is related to the development of prostate cancer (PCa). Through bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses, as well as in vitro and in vivo experiments, this study aims to investigate the effect of BDE-47 exposure on PCa progression. Herein, we found that low dose BDE-47 promoted the growth of PCa cells (PC3 and LNCaP) in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. Based on Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we obtained 34 BDE-47-related and PCa-related genes through screening and overlapping. These genes were significantly enriched in fatty acid metabolism-related gene ontology (GO) terms, which were also enriched for genes targeting BDE-47 obtained from the UniProt. Through scRNA-seq data, certain cell type-specific expression was observed for CYP2E1, PIK3R1, FGF2, and TOP2A in PCa tissues from men. Molecular docking simulation showed that BDE-47 was tightly bound to the protein residues of AOX1, PIK3R1, FGF2, CAV2, CYP2E1 and TOP2A. Further screening in terms of patient overall survival, receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) curve and Gleason score grading system narrowed the candidate genes down to TOP2A. Mechanistically, the growth-promoting effect of BDE-47 on PCa cells could be reversed by TOP2A inhibitor. RNA-seq followed by experimental verification demonstrated that TOP2A promoted PCa progression through upregulating LDHA and glycolysis. Furthermore, lactate upregulated TOP2A transcription through lactylation of H3K18la in PCa cells, which could be rescued by LDHA knockdown. Taken together, low dose BDE-47 triggered PCa progression through TOP2A/LDHA/lactylation positive feedback circuit, thus revealing epigenetic shifting and metabolic reprogramming underpinning BDE-47-induced carcinogenesis of the prostate."
39361894,Compromised CDK12 activity causes dependency on the high activity of O-GlcNAc transferase.,"O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) coordinates with regulators of transcription, including cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), the major transcription elongation kinase. Here, we use inhibitor- and knockdown-based strategies to show that co-targeting of OGT and CDK12 is toxic to prostate cancer cells. OGT catalyzes all nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAcylation and due to its essentiality in higher eukaryotes, it is not an ideal drug target. Our glycoproteomics-data revealed that short-term CDK12 inhibition induces hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of the spliceosome-machinery in different models of prostate cancer. By integrating our glycoproteomics-, gene essentiality- and clinical-data from CDK12 mutant prostate cancer patients, we identify the non-essential serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) as a synthetic lethal partner with CDK12-inactivation. Both normal and cancer cells become highly sensitive against inhibitors of OGT and SRPK1 if they have lowered activity of CDK12. Inactivating mutations in CDK12 are enriched in aggressive prostate cancer, and we propose that these patients would benefit from therapy targeting the spliceosome."
29261872,Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men globally and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. In 2020, there were 1,414,249 newly diagnosed cases and 375,000 deaths worldwide annually due to this disease. Globally, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in more than 50% of countries (112 out of 185). Fortunately, most prostate cancers tend to grow slowly and are low-grade with relatively low risk and limited aggressiveness. There are no initial or early symptoms in most cases, but late symptoms may include fatigue due to anemia, bone pain, paralysis from spinal metastases, and renal failure from bilateral ureteral obstruction. Diagnosis is primarily based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) prostate tissue biopsies, although PSA testing for screening remains controversial. Newer diagnostic modalities include free and total PSA levels, PCA3 urine testing, Prostate Health Index (PHI) scoring, the 4K test, exosome testing, genomic analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring, and MRI-TRUS fusion-guided biopsies.  When the cancer is limited to the prostate, it is considered localized and potentially curable. If the cancer has spread to the bones or other areas outside the prostate, treatment options include pain medications, bisphosphonates, rank ligand inhibitors, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiopharmaceuticals, immunotherapy, focused radiation, and other targeted therapies. Outcomes depend on age, associated health problems, tumor histology, and the extent of cancer."
39359425,"Investigating the Relationship of G-137C, C-607A, and A-1447G Polymorphisms in the Promoter of IL-18 and CXCL10 Inflammatory Genes with Prostate Cancer in an Iranian Population.","INTRODUCTION: Genetic and environmental factors are involved in prostate cancer. The current study was conducted to study the relationship between G-137C, C-607A, and A-1447G polymorphisms in the promoter of IL-18 and CXCL10 inflammatory genes with prostate cancer. METHODS: As a genetic association study with a case-control design, the genomes of people living in Khorasan, Iran, were compared in two groups of cases and controls. The genotype of the A-1447G polymorphism present in the CXCL10 gene promoter was investigated by the PCR-RFLP method. PCR-SSP was used to study the genotype of G-137C and C-607A polymorphisms present in the IL-18 gene promoter. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. RESULTS: One mutant allele in CXCL10 A-1447G polymorphism (AG) increased the chance of cancer (OR = 4.902, 95% CI = 2.70-8.87) and two mutant alleles (GG) increased more (OR = 7.174, 95% CI = 2.48-20.68). One mutant allele in IL-18 G-137C polymorphism (CG) increased the chance of cancer (OR = 5.583, 95% CI = 3.04-10.22) and two mutant alleles (CC) increased more (OR = 9.571, 95% CI = 3.10-29.46). One mutant allele in IL-18 C607A polymorphism (CA) increased the chance of cancer (OR = 5.359, 95% CI = 2.95-9.70) and two mutant alleles (AA) increased more (OR = 7.083, 95% CI = 2.61-19.15) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: According to the results, the mutant alleles in polymorphisms CXCL10 A-1447G, IL-18 G-137C, and IL-18 C-607A alleles were associated with an increased chance of prostate cancer in this population."
39358599,Heterogeneous genetic architectures of prostate cancer susceptibility in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Men of African descent have the highest prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, yet the genetic basis of prostate cancer in African men has been understudied. We used genomic data from 3,963 cases and 3,509 controls from Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Uganda to infer ancestry-specific genetic architectures and fine-map disease associations. Fifteen independent associations at 8q24.21, 6q22.1 and 11q13.3 reached genome-wide significance, including four new associations. Intriguingly, multiple lead associations are private alleles, a pattern arising from recent mutations and the out-of-Africa bottleneck. These African-specific alleles contribute to haplotypes with odds ratios above 2.4. We found that the genetic architecture of prostate cancer differs across Africa, with effect size differences contributing more to this heterogeneity than allele frequency differences. Population genetic analyses reveal that African prostate cancer associations are largely governed by neutral evolution. Collectively, our findings emphasize the utility of conducting genetic studies that use diverse populations."
39357460,Roles of Long Noncoding RNA in Prostate Cancer Pathogenesis.,"Prostate cancer stands as the most common cancer in men, and research into its genesis and spread is still vital. The idea that the human genome's transcriptional activity is more widespread than previously thought has received empirical validation through the application of deep sequencing-based transcriptome profiling techniques. An assortment of noncoding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides is referred to as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Transposable elements comprise a substantial portion of the human genome, with projections indicating that their prospective proportion may reach 90%. Considering they can interact directly with proteins, alter the transcriptional activity of coding genes, and perhaps encode proteins, lncRNAs possess the capability to regulate a variety of biological processes. LncRNAs have been recognized to be key factors in the development of several types of human cancers, including lung, colorectal, and breast cancers, alongside other pathological processes that have a significant impact on the diagnosis and survival of cancer individuals. Furthermore, lncRNAs' discernible expression patterns throughout various cancer scenarios significantly raise their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We conducted an extensive analysis of the prevailing academic literature on the interaction between lncRNAs and prostate cancer in order to present a solid foundation for potential future studies on the prevention and intervention of prostate cancer. The discourse additionally expands on lncRNAs' prospective applications as targets and biomarkers for medical therapies."
39353441,Development of an orally bioavailable CDK12/13 degrader and induction of synthetic lethality with AKT pathway inhibition.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases 12/13 play pivotal roles in orchestrating transcription elongation, DNA damage response, and maintenance of genomic stability. Biallelic CDK12 loss has been documented in various malignancies. Here, we develop a selective CDK12/13 PROTAC degrader, YJ9069, which effectively inhibits proliferation in subsets of prostate cancer cells preferentially over benign immortalized cells. CDK12/13 degradation rapidly triggers gene-length-dependent transcriptional elongation defects, leading to DNA damage and cell-cycle arrest. In vivo, YJ9069 significantly suppresses prostate tumor growth. Modifications of YJ9069 yielded an orally bioavailable CDK12/13 degrader, YJ1206, which exhibits comparable efficacy with significantly less toxicity. To identify pathways synthetically lethal upon CDK12/13 degradation, phosphorylation pathway arrays were performed using cell lines treated with YJ1206. Interestingly, degradation or genetic knockdown of CDK12/13 led to activation of the AKT pathway. Targeting CDK12/13 for degradation, in conjunction with inhibiting the AKT pathway, resulted in a synthetic lethal effect in preclinical prostate cancer models."
39353397,Analysis and functional validations of multiple cell death patterns for prognosis in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) has garnered significant attention due to its rising incidence, variable therapeutic outcomes, and the absence of reliable prognostic markers. The significance of different cell death patterns in tumor development underscores their potential as predictors of PCa prognosis. This study utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets to evaluate the prognostic capabilities of 15 cell death patterns and established a Cell Death Index (CDI) signature based on necrosis and cuproptosis-related genes. The predictive efficacy of the CDI signature was validated in our PCa cohort and in two public datasets: Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) PCa cohorts. Our comprehensive analysis examined the relationship between CDI signature and clinical characteristics, published prognostic signatures, gene mutations, immune cell infiltration, enrichment pathways, and drug sensitivity in PCa. In vitro and in vivo studies assessed the impact of EDA2R and LOXL2 on PCa progression. The CDI signature exhibited robust predictive performance across three independent validation sets, with 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year area under the curve (AUC) values in the TCGA cohort of 0.866, 0.77, 0.836, 0.776, and 0.787, respectively. Higher CDI scores were correlated with advanced T and N stages, elevated Gleason scores, increased immune cell infiltration, gene mutations, and drug sensitivity. EDA2R inhibited PCa cell proliferation and migration, related to tumor necrosis, while LOXL2 promoted these processes and was associated with cuproptosis. In summary, our study identified a novel CDI signature as an effective indicator for diagnosis, personalized treatment, and prognostic assessment in PCa."
39356641,Protocol for culturing patient-derived organoids of cervical cancer.,"Herein, we present a protocol for culturing patient-derived organoids (PDOs) of cervical cancer that includes workflows for tumor biopsy/resection tissue and cytobrush-sampled cells. We describe steps for PDO culture initiation, including rinsing, gentle dissociation, Lymphoprep separation, and cell assessment, as well as seeding cells from surgical and cytobrush tissue digestion. We then provide guidance on PDO maintenance and passage and techniques for producing conditioned medium. Overall, this protocol serves as a valuable guide for establishing and maintaining cervical cancer PDOs. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Colbert et al.(1)."
39354583,Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma to the brain - a clinicopathologic analysis of 21 cases.,"BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis from prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) is rare, often leading to death within a year. Its infrequent occurrence and atypical histopathologic features contribute to lower consideration in the differential diagnosis of tumor brain metastasis. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and distinctive histopathologic features of metastatic PCa in the brain for timely and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. DESIGN: A retrospective search spanning 20 years (2003-2022) was conducted on our archives and identified 21 cases diagnosed as ""metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (mPCa)"" in brain biopsies and resections. All existing slides were thoroughly reviewed to evaluate the histopathology of the mPCa. RESULT: The mean age at presentation for brain metastasis was 70 years. Of 21 cases, 5 were dural-based lesions, 16 were true intraparenchymal metastases, including 2 sellar/suprasellar masses, 3 frontal, 3 temporal, 3 occipital, 1 cerebellum, and 4 involving multiple brain lobes. The average interval between initial diagnosis and brain metastasis was 90.75 months. Notably, brain metastasis was the initial presentation for one patient, while another patient, initially diagnosed with prognostic grade group (GG) 2 PCa in 1/12 cores, presented with isolated brain metastasis two years later. Architecturally, tumor cells were arranged in sheets or nests in most cases; however, four cases showed histologic cribriform patterns, and five displayed papillary architecture. Cytohistology varied from uniform monomorphic to highly pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli (8/19) and high mitotic activity. Interestingly, 1 case showed small round blue cell morphology, another had focal areas of rhabdoid and spindle cell differentiation, and 6 had cytoplasmic clearing. Almost half of the cases (47%) showed necrosis. CONCLUSION: mPCa to the brain can present with variable histomorphology. Therefore, consideration of mPCa in the differential diagnosis of metastatic brain lesions, even with non-suggestive imaging, is imperative in male patients with or without a history of primary disease. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is crucial, given the recent advancements in treatment that have improved survival rates."
39354185,Germline and somatic testing for homologous repair deficiency in patients with prostate cancer (part 1 of 2).,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Unfortunately, not all metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receive available life-prolonging systemic therapies, emphasizing the need to optimize mCRPC treatment selections. Better guidelines are necessary to determine genetic testing in prostate cancer. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this two-part expert opinion-based guide, we provide an expert consensus opinion on the utilization of germline and somatic testing to detect HRR alterations in patients with mCRPC. This guide was developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel that convened in 2023-2024, including representatives from medical oncology, urology, radiation oncology, pathology, medical genomics, and basic science. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: We argue for the widespread adoption of germline testing in all patients with prostate cancer and for somatic mutations testing in patients at the time of recurrent/metastatic disease. In this first part, we review how genomic testing is performed. We also review how to overcome certain barriers to integrate genetic and biomarker testing into clinical practice."
39352383,Genomic and transcriptomic features of androgen receptor signaling inhibitor resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUNDAndrogen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) have improved outcomes for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but their clinical benefit is limited by treatment resistance.METHODSTo investigate the mechanisms of ARSI resistance, we analyzed the whole-genome (n = 45) and transcriptome (n = 31) sequencing data generated from paired metastatic biopsies obtained before initiation of first-line ARSI therapy for mCRPC and after radiographic disease progression. We investigated the effects of genetic and pharmacologic modulation of SSTR1 in 22Rv1 cells, a representative mCRPC cell line.RESULTSWe confirmed the predominant role of tumor genetic alterations converging on augmenting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and the increased transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage plasticity during the emergence of ARSI resistance. We further identified amplifications involving a putative enhancer downstream of the AR and transcriptional downregulation of SSTR1, encoding somatostatin receptor 1, in ARSI-resistant tumors. We found that patients with SSTR1-low mCRPC tumors derived less benefit from subsequent ARSI therapy in a retrospective cohort. We showed that SSTR1 was antiproliferative in 22Rv1 cells and that the FDA-approved drug pasireotide suppressed 22Rv1 cell proliferation.CONCLUSIONOur findings expand the knowledge of ARSI resistance and point out actionable next steps, exemplified by potentially targeting SSTR1, to improve patient outcomes.FUNDINGNational Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH; Prostate Cancer Foundation; Conquer Cancer, American Society of Clinical Oncology Foundation; UCSF Benioff Initiative for Prostate Cancer Research; Netherlands Cancer Institute."
39352309,"Methylation, Gene Expression, and Risk Genotypes at the TERT-CLPTM1L Locus in Cervical Cancer.","The reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, TERT, is frequently activated in high-grade dysplasia and invasive cancers of the uterine cervix. Telomerase activation through hypomethylation of the TERT promoter holds promise as a biomarker for cervical cancer progression, however, specific CpG sites involved in cervical cancer risk remain to be fully defined. A recent genome-wide association study on cervical cancer identified genetic polymorphisms at 5p13.33 (close to TERT-CLPTM1L) but the underlying mechanisms are undetermined. We investigated 529 CpG sites within the TERT promoter region and 3 CpG islands nearby, and 21 CpG sites within CLPTM1L in 190 bisulfite-converted cervical tumor DNA samples from BioRAIDs (NCT02428842). We identified eight CpG sites within TERT intron 2 where methylation was significantly associated with the genotypes of cervical cancer risk variants rs27070 and rs459961 in cervical tumors after multiple testing correction (p < 9.4 x 10E-5). Hypermethylation at chr5:1289663 correlated with decreased TERT mRNA levels. In an independent series of 188 normal or dysplastic cervical tissues, rare alleles of rs27070 and rs459961 were associated with low basal CLPTM1L levels and with the absence of TERT mRNA in HPV-negative samples, consistent with their proposed role as protective variants for cervical cancer. HPV infection was associated with increased CLPTM1L and TERT levels. Collectively, our results provide a link between cervical cancer risk variants, methylation, and gene expression and implicate both TERT and CLPTM1L as genes modulated by genomic background and HPV infection during cervical cancer development."
39351232,"Comprehensive analysis of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in prostate adenocarcinoma: insights into gene expression, immune microenvironment and tumor progression.","Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is a prevalent global malignancy which depends more on lipid metabolism for tumor progression compared to other cancer types. Although Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) is documented to regulate lipid metabolism in multiple cancers, landscape analysis of its implications in PRAD are still missing at present. Here, we conducted an analysis of diverse cancer datasets revealing elevated SCD expression in the PRAD cohort at both mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, the elevated expression was associated with SCD promoter hypermethylation and genetic alterations, notably the L134V mutation. Integration of comprehensive tumor immunological and genomic data revealed a robust positive correlation between SCD expression levels and the abundance of CD8(+) T cells and macrophages. Further analyses identified significant associations between SCD expression and various immune markers in tumor microenvironment. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling unveiled differential SCD expression patterns across distinct cell types within the prostate tumor microenvironment. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome analyses showed that SCD enriched pathways were primarily related to lipid biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum membrane functions, and various metabolic pathways. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted the involvement of elevated SCD expression in crucial cellular processes, including the cell cycle and biosynthesis of cofactors pathways. In functional studies, SCD overexpression promoted the proliferation, metastasis and invasion of prostate cancer cells, whereas downregulation inhibits these processes. This study provides comprehensive insights into the multifaceted roles of SCD in PRAD pathogenesis, underscoring its potential as both a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker."
39350977,Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor II: A possible biomarker of poor prognosis and mediator of immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of primary liver cancer is increasing year by year. In 2022 alone, more than 900000 people were diagnosed with liver cancer worldwide, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounting for 75%-85% of cases. HCC is the most common primary liver cancer. China has the highest incidence and mortality rate of HCC in the world, and it is one of the malignant tumors that seriously threaten the health of Chinese people. The onset of liver cancer is occult, the early cases lack typical clinical symptoms, and most of the patients are already in the middle and late stage when diagnosed. Therefore, it is very important to find new markers for the early detection and diagnosis of liver cancer, improve the therapeutic effect, and improve the prognosis of patients. Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 2 (PTPN2) has been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer, but its biological role and function in tumors remain to be further studied. AIM: To combine the results of relevant data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to provide the first in-depth analysis of the biological role of PTPN2 in HCC. METHODS: The expression of PTPN2 in HCC was first analyzed based on the TCGA database, and the findings were then verified by immunohistochemical staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunoblotting. The value of PTPN2 in predicting the survival of patients with HCC was assessed by analyzing the relationship between PTPN2 expression in HCC tissues and clinicopathological features. Finally, the potential of PTPN2 affecting immune escape of liver cancer was evaluated by tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The results of immunohistochemical staining, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting in combination with TCGA database analysis showed that PTPN2 was highly expressed and associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis showed that PTPN2 was associated with various pathways, including cancer-related pathways, the Notch signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed that PTPN2 was highly expressed in various immune-related pathways, such as the epithelial mesenchymal transition process. A risk model score based on PTPN2 showed that immune escape was significantly enhanced in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. CONCLUSION: This study investigated PTPN2 from multiple biological perspectives, revealing that PTPN2 can function as a biomarker of poor prognosis and mediate immune evasion in HCC."
39350309,When is prostate cancer really cancer?,"Prostate cancer (PC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with far more diagnoses than deaths annually. Recent discussions have challenged whether Grade Group 1 (GG1) PC should be labeled ""cancer"" due to its indolent nature. To address this question, an international symposium convened stakeholders from various fields. We summarize key discussion points: autopsy studies reveal GG1 is so common in aging males as to be perhaps a normal aspect of aging. Pure GG1 has no capacity to metastasize. Modern diagnostic pathways focus on detecting higher-grade disease, explicitly omitting biopsy if GG 2 or higher is not suspected, so GG1 has effectively become an ""incidentaloma."" Recent spatial transcriptomics of prostate sections identifies a continuum of genomic changes-including alterations characteristic of malignancy in histologically normal regions, so the designation of cancer based entirely on conventional pathology findings increasingly seems arbitrary at least to an extent. Pathologists discussed heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges, suggesting ""acinar neoplasm"" as one possible alternative label. GG1 should not be considered ""normal,"" and absolutely requires ongoing active surveillance; whether patients would adhere to surveillance absent a cancer diagnosis is unknown. Patient perspectives highlighted the adverse effects of overtreatment and the burden of a cancer diagnosis. The anticipated impact on screening and treatment varies across health-care systems, but many believe public health would on balance greatly improve if GG1-along with lesions in other organs with no capacity to cause symptoms or threaten life-were labeled something other than ""cancer."" Ultimately, our goal is to reduce PC mortality while minimizing harms associated with both overdiagnosis and overtreatment."
39349877,Exploring the interaction between immune cells in the prostate cancer microenvironment combining weighted correlation gene network analysis and single-cell sequencing: An integrated bioinformatics analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The rise of treatment resistance and variability across malignant profiles has made precision oncology an imperative in today's medical landscape. Prostate cancer is a prevalent form of cancer in males, characterized by significant diversity in both genomic and clinical characteristics. The tumor microenvironment consists of stroma, tumor cells, and various immune cells. The stromal components and tumor cells engage in mutual communication and facilitate the development of a low-oxygen and pro-cancer milieu by producing cytokines and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. METHODS: In order to discover new genes associated with tumor cells that interact and facilitate a hypoxic environment in prostate cancer, we conducted a cutting-edge bioinformatics investigation. This included analyzing high-throughput genomic datasets obtained from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: A combination of weighted gene co-expression network analysis and single-cell sequencing has identified nine dysregulated immune hub genes (AMACR, KCNN3, MME, EGFR, FLT1, GDF15, KDR, IGF1, and KRT7) that are believed to have significant involvement in the biological pathways involved with the advancement of prostate cancer enviriment. In the prostate cancer environment, we observed the overexpression of GDF15 and KRT7 genes, as well as the downregulation of other genes. Additionally, the cBioPortal platform was used to investigate the frequency of alterations in the genes and their effects on the survival of the patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the changes in the candidate genes were associated with a reduction in the overall survival of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the findings indicate that studying the genes and their genomic changes may be used to develop precise treatments for prostate cancer. This approach involves early detection and targeted therapy."
39349591,Integrated multi-omics assessment of lineage plasticity in a prostate cancer patient with brain and dural metastases.,"Metastases to the brain are rare in prostate cancer. Here, we describe a patient with two treatment-emergent metastatic lesions, one to the brain with neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) histology and one to the dural membrane of adenocarcinoma histology. We performed genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characterization of these lesions and the primary tumor to investigate molecular features promoting these metastases. The two metastatic lesions had high genomic similarity, including TP53 mutation and PTEN deletion, with the most striking difference being the additional loss of RB1 in the NEPC lesion. Interestingly, the dural lesion expressed both androgen receptor and neuroendocrine markers, suggesting amphicrine carcinoma (AMPC). When analyzing pioneer transcription factors, the AMPC lesion exhibited elevated FOXA1 activity while the brain NEPC lesion showed elevated HOXC10, NFYB, and OTX2 expression suggesting novel roles in NEPC formation or brain tropism. Our results highlight the utility of performing multi-omic characterization, especially in rare cancer subtypes."
39348956,TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusion Might Predict Resistance to PARP Inhibitors in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The emergence of novel DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways in molecular-target therapy drugs (MTTD) has shown promising outcomes in treating patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). About 25% of mCRPC patients have actionable deleterious aberrations in DDR genes, primarily in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. However, the response rate in patients with BRCA1/2 or mutations in HRR-related genes is only 45%-55%, when exposed to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-based therapy (PARPi). A frequent characteristic feature of prostate cancer (PC) is the occurrence of genomic rearrangement that affects the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and E26 transformation-specific (ETS)- transcription factor-related gene (ERG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, a total of 114 patients with mCRPC had their RNA and DNA sequenced using next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Based on their genetic profile of deleterious gene alterations of BRCA1/2 or ATM, six patients were selected for PARPi. Patients with TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and homozygous alteration in ATM or BRCA2 (n=2) or heterozygous alterations (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and lack of TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion (n=2) did not show clinical benefit from PARPi (treatment duration <16 weeks). In contrast, patients (n=2) without TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion and homozygous deleterious alterations in ATM or BRCA2 all had clinical benefit from PARPi (treatment duration >/=16 weeks). CONCLUSION: The TMPRSS2:ERG transcript product might be used as a PARPi resistance biomarker."
39348607,Genomic Landscape in Prostate Cancer in a Latin American Population.,"PURPOSE: This study aims to describe genomic characteristics of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of patients with mPC and reports on genomic testing. Patients were included from 12 academic centers in five countries. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients with PC were included in this study. Most patients (209, 59.9%) were de novo metastatic. Genomic analysis was performed in 233 (66.6%) patients in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) setting, and only 115 (32.8%) patients had a tumor evaluation in the metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer scenario. The evaluation of somatic and/or germline mutations was performed through multigene panel analyses in 290 (83.09%) patients, and next-generation sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was performed in 59 (16.91%) patients. Analyzing the mCRPC subgroup, with a median follow-up of 15.6 months (IQR, 14-19.06), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached (NR) and the PFS at 16 months was 58.7% (95% CI, 50.8 to 67.8). When comparing patients with BRCA mutations with those who are not BRCA-mutated in the mCRPC scenario, the median PFS was NR (95% CI, 14 to NR) and 26.3 months (95% CI, 16.7 to 36.5; P = .2), respectively. Two of six patients with BRCA mutations were treated with targeted therapies (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors). CONCLUSION: Our study, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the larger data sets for somatic testing in patients with PC in Latin America (LATAM). It adds valuable information to the growing body of knowledge about the genomic landscape of advanced PC in real-world daily practice scenarios in LATAM countries, which are not always well-represented in large-scale randomized clinical trials."
39347576,Prostate Cancer Progression Modeling Provides Insight into Dynamic Molecular Changes Associated with Progressive Disease States.,"Prostate cancer is a significant health concern and the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. Understanding the complex process of prostate tumor evolution and progression is crucial for improved diagnosis, treatments, and patient outcomes. Previous studies have focused on unraveling the dynamics of prostate cancer evolution using phylogenetic or lineage analysis approaches. However, those approaches have limitations in capturing the complete disease process or incorporating genomic and transcriptomic variations comprehensively. In this study, we applied a novel computational approach to derive a prostate cancer progression model using multidimensional data from 497 prostate tumor samples and 52 tumor-adjacent normal samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. The model was validated using data from an independent cohort of 545 primary tumor samples. By integrating transcriptomic and genomic data, our model provides a comprehensive view of prostate tumor progression, identifies crucial signaling pathways and genetic events, and uncovers distinct transcription signatures associated with disease progression. Our findings have significant implications for cancer research and hold promise for guiding personalized treatment strategies in prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: We developed and validated a progression model of prostate cancer using >1,000 tumor and normal tissue samples. The model provided a comprehensive view of prostate tumor evolution and progression."
39346724,Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like is a putative regulator of tumorigenesis and sensitization of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer stands as one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, yet the precise functions of host genes implicated in its pathogenesis remain elusive. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a significant association between the CLPTM1L locus and cervical cancer risk in European women, and aberrant expression of CLPTM1L has been noted in various malignant tumors. However, the role of CLPTM1L in cervical cancer remains largely unexplored. METHODS: The expression of CLPTM1L in cervical cancer cells and tissues was detected by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, the potential biological functions of CLPTM1L in the context of cervical cancer were explored via RNA sequencing. Cell proliferation rates and the responsiveness of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay, while cell apoptosis was quantified through the utilization of flow cytometry. Nude mouse xenograft models were utilized to explore the impact of CLPTM1L on tumor formation in vivo. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated a significant increase in CLPTM1L mRNA expression levels in HeLa and C33A cells, as well as in cervical carcinoma tissues, compared to ECT1/E6E7 cells and adjacent normal tissues. Genes related to CLPTM1L were found to be enriched in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that reducing CLPTM1L expression markedly inhibited cell proliferation via downstream candidate genes BOC and LRP2. Furthermore, the downregulation of CLPTM1L was found to enhance cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis and increase the susceptibility of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin through DAP1. CONCLUSIONS: CLPTM1L could impact cervical cancer cell proliferation and cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, as well as cisplatin susceptibility in cervical cancer cells. This investigation has bestowed upon us novel insights into the pathogenesis of cervical cancer, underscoring the potential of CLPTM1L as a promising target for chemotherapeutic sensitization in the management of this malignancy."
39346086,HPV-driven heterogeneity in cervical cancer: study on the role of epithelial cells and myofibroblasts in the tumor progression based on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is a neoplasia with a high heterogeneity. We aimed to explore the characteristics of tumor microenvironment (TME) for CC treatment. METHODS: HPV positive (+) and negative (-) samples from cervical cancer (CC) patients were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were processed and annotated for cell types utilizing the Seurat package. Following this, the expression levels and biological roles of the marker genes were analyzed applying real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and transwell assays. Furthermore, the enrichment of genes with significantly differential expressions and copy number variations was assessed by the ClusterProlifer and inferCNV software packages. RESULTS: Seven main cell clusters were classified based on a total of 12,431 cells. The HPV- CC samples exhibited a higher immune cell infiltration level, while epithelial cells and myofibroblasts had higher proportion in the HPV+ CC samples with extensive heterogeneity. Immune pathways including antigen treatment and presentation, immunoglobulin production and T cell mediated immunity were significantly activated in the HPV- CC group with lower cell cycle and proliferation activity. However, the anti-tumor immunity of these cells was inhibited in HPV+ CC group with higher cell proliferation activity. Moreover, the amplification and loss of CNVs also supported that these cells in HPV- CC samples were prone to anti-tumor activation. Further cell validation results showed that except GZMA, the levels of APOC1, CEACAM6, FOXP3, SFRP4 and TFF3 were all higher in CC cells Hela, and that silencing TFF3 could inhibit the migration and invasion of CC cells in-vitro. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the critical role of HPV infection in CC progression, providing a novel molecular basis for optimizing the current preventive screening and personalized treatment for the cancer."
39344423,Expanding the clinicopathologic spectrum and genomic landscape of tumors with SMARCA2/4::CREM fusions.,"CREB gene family (ATF1, CREB1, CREM) fusions with either EWSR1 or FUS gene partners drive the pathogenesis of a wide range of neoplasms, including various soft tissue tumors, intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumors (IMMTs), hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma (HCCC), and rare mesotheliomas. Recently, a SMARCA2::CREM fusion was reported in one case each of IMMT and HCCC. In this study, we expand the clinicopathologic and molecular spectrum of these neoplasms by describing three additional cases with SMARCA2::CREM and one with a novel SMARCA4::CREM fusion, highlighting the recurrent potential of additional CREB gene fusion partners beyond FET family members. To evaluate if these fusions define a new pathologic entity, we performed a comprehensive genomic and methylation analysis and compared the results to other related tumors. Tumors occurred in children and young adults (median age 20 years) and spanned a broad anatomic distribution, including soft tissue, intracranial, head and neck, and prostatic urethra. Microscopically, the tumors shared an undifferentiated round to epithelioid cell phenotype and a hyalinized fibrous stroma. Immunohistochemically, a polyphenotypic profile was observed, with variable expression of SOX10, desmin, and/or epithelial markers. No targetable genomic alterations were found using panel-based DNA sequencing. By DNA methylation and transcriptomic analyses, tumors grouped closely to FET::CREB entities, but not with SMARCA4/SMARCB1-deficient tumors. High expression of CREM by immunohistochemistry was also documented in these tumors. Patients experienced local recurrence (n = 2), locoregional lymph node metastases (n = 2), and an isolated visceral metastasis (n = 1). Overall, our study suggests that SMARCA2/4::CREM fusions define a distinct group of neoplasms with round cell to epithelioid histology, a variable immunoprofile, and a definite risk of malignancy. Larger studies are needed to further explore the pathogenetic relationship with the FET::CREB family of tumors. (c) 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."
39344121,Investigating the Shared Genetic Architecture Between Leukocyte Telomere Length and Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Evidence of an association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and prostate cancer (PCa) is accumulating; however, their shared genetic basis remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using summary statistics obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS), we quantified the global and local genetic correlations between two traits. Subsequently, we identified potential pleiotropic loci, common tissue-enriched regions, and risk gene loci while inferring assumed causal relationships. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated a global genetic correlation between LTL and PCa (genetic correlation=0.066, p=0.017), which was further confirmed in local genomic regions. Cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis revealed 44 shared loci, including 10 novel pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms appearing concurrently in significant local genetic correlation regions. Notably, two new loci (rs9419958; rs3730668) were additionally validated to co-localize. For the first time, we identified a significant shared genetic enrichment of both traits in the small intestine tissue at the terminal ileum, with functional genes in this region affecting both LTL and PCa. Concurrently, Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive causal relationship between LTL and PCa. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study makes a significant contribution to the ongoing debate concerning the potential association between longer LTL and a higher risk of PCa. Additionally, we provide new evidence for the development of therapeutic targets for PCa and propose new directions for future risk prediction in this regard."
39343999,Exploring prognostic biomarkers in pathological images of colorectal cancer patients via deep learning.,"Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole slide images provide valuable information for predicting prognostic outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, extracting prognostic indicators from pathological images is challenging due to the subtle complexities of phenotypic information. We trained a weakly supervised deep learning model on data from 640 CRC patients in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial dataset and validated it using data from 522 CRC patients in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset. We created the colorectal cancer risk score (CRCRS) to assess patient prognosis, visualized the pathological phenotype of the risk score using Grad-CAM, and employed multiomics data from the TCGA CRC cohort to investigate the potential biological mechanisms underlying the risk score. The overall survival analysis revealed that the CRCRS served as an independent prognostic indicator for both the PLCO cohort (p < 0.001) and the TCGA cohort (p < 0.001), with its predictive efficacy remaining unaffected by the clinical staging system. Additionally, satisfactory chemotherapeutic benefits were observed in stage II/III CRC patients with high CRCRS but not in those with low CRCRS. A pathomics nomogram constructed by integrating the CRCRS with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system enhanced prognostic prediction accuracy compared with using the TNM staging system alone. Noteworthy features of the risk score were identified, such as immature tumor mesenchyme, disorganized gland structures, small clusters of cancer cells associated with unfavorable prognosis, and infiltrating inflammatory cells associated with favorable prognosis. The TCGA multiomics data revealed potential correlations between the CRCRS and the activation of energy production and metabolic pathways, the tumor immune microenvironment, and genetic mutations in APC, SMAD2, EEF1AKMT4, EPG5, and TANC1. In summary, our deep learning algorithm identified the CRCRS as a prognostic indicator in CRC, providing a significant approach for prognostic risk stratification and tailoring precise treatment strategies for individual patients."
39342337,BTN3A1 expressed in cervical cancer cells promotes Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells exhaustion through upregulating transcription factors NR4A2/3 downstream of TCR signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown that immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells (Vdelta2 T cells) is safe and well-tolerated for various cancers including cervical cancer (CC), but its overall treatment efficacy remains limited. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying the suboptimal efficacy of Vdelta2 T cell-based cancer immunotherapy is crucial for enabling its successful clinical translation. METHODS: Tumor samples from CC patients and CC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) mice were analyzed using flow cytometry to examine the exhausted phenotype of tumor-infiltrating Vdelta2 T cells. The interrelationship between BTN3A1 expression and Vdelta2 T cells in CC, along with their correlation with patient prognosis, was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. CC cell lines with BTN3A1 knockout (KO) and overexpression (OE) were constructed through lentivirus transduction, which were then co-cultured with expanded Vdelta2 T cells, followed by detecting the function of Vdelta2 T cells using flow cytometry. The pathways and transcription factors (TFs) related to BTN3A1-induced Vdelta2 T cells exhaustion and the factors affecting BTN3A1 expression were identified by RNA-seq analysis, which was confirmed by flow cytometry, Western Blot, and gene manipulation. RESULTS: Tumor-infiltrating Vdelta2 T cells exhibited an exhausted phenotype in both CC patients and CDX mice. BTN3A1 expressed in CC is highly enhancing exhaustion markers, while reducing the secretion of effector molecules in Vdelta2 T cells. Blocking TCR or knocking down nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A (NR4A) 2/3 can reverse BTN3A1-induced exhaustion in Vdelta2 T cells. On the other hand, IFN-gamma secreted by Vdelta2 T cells promoted the expression of BTN3A1 and PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: Through binding gammadelta TCRs, BTN3A1 expressed on tumor cells, which is induced by IFN-gamma, can promote Vdelta2 T cells to upregulate the expression of TFs NR4A2/3, thereby affecting their activation and expression of exhaustion-related molecules in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, targeting BTN3A1 might overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the TME on Vdelta2 T cells in CC."
39341711,"Oncogenic MicroRNAs: Key players in human prostate cancer pathogenesis, a narrative review.","Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide, and identifying key molecular players in its pathogenesis is essential for advancing effective diagnosis and therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as significant molecules involved in the progression of various cancers. As noncoding RNAs, miRNAs play a vital role in regulating gene expression and are implicated in several aspects of cancer pathogenesis. In the context of human PC, growing evidence suggests that certain miRNAs with oncogenic properties are key players in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of the disease. In conclusion, dysregulated miRNAs are critical in prostate cancer progression, influencing key cellular processes. Oncogenic miRNAs exhibit diagnostic and therapeutic potential in PC. Targeting these miRNAs presents novel treatment avenues, but further research is needed to fully understand their clinical utility. Additional investigation into the mechanisms of miRNA regulation and their interactions with other signaling pathways is necessary to comprehensively understand the role of oncogenic miRNAs in PC and to develop effective treatments for this disease. Overall, substantiating the role of oncogenic miRNAs in PC pathogenesis provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the disease and may lead to the development of novel targeted therapies for improved patient outcomes."
39340335,A new treatment approach of toripalimab in combination with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer: A phase II clinical trial.,"This study investigated the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation in patients with untreated locally advanced cervical cancer. Eligible patients received toripalimab 240 mg once every 3 weeks in combination with concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, followed by the maintenance of toripalimab once every 6 weeks up to 1 year. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included 2-year and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates, 3-year overall survival (OS) rate, and safety. Biomarker analysis of PD-L1 expression and genomic mutational analysis by next-generation sequencing were conducted, as well as PD-L1 expression on tumor biopsies. A total of 82 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 21 months (range, 5.2-44.5 months). The ORR and disease control rate were both 87.8% among the 82 patients. Median PFS and OS were not reached. A trend toward longer PFS was observed in the populations with a PD-L1 combined positive score >/=10, low tumor mutation burden and loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (HLA LOH) detected populations. A total of 37 patients experienced treatment-related adverse events, of which 17 (20.7%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events. Collectively, toripalimab plus concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy showed promising antitumor efficacy with acceptable safety profiles in patients with untreated locally advanced cervical cancer."
39337607,Semen sEV tRF-Based Models Increase Non-Invasive Prediction Accuracy of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer among Patients with Moderately Altered PSA Levels.,"PSA screening has led to an over-diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and unnecessary biopsies of benign conditions due to its low cancer specificity. Consequently, more accurate, preferentially non-invasive, tests are needed. We aim to evaluate the potential of semen sEV (small extracellular vesicles) tsRNAs (tRNA-derived small RNAs) as PCa indicators. Initially, following a literature review in the OncotRF database and high-throughput small RNA-sequencing studies in PCa tissue together with the sncRNA profile in semen sEVs, we selected four candidate 5'tRF tsRNAs for validation as PCa biomarkers. RT-qPCR analysis in semen sEVs from men with moderately elevated serum PSA levels successfully shows that the differential expression of the four tRFs between PCa and healthy control groups can be detected in a non-invasive manner. The combined model incorporating PSA and specific tRFs (5'-tRNA-Glu-TTC-9-1_L30 and 5'-tRNA-Val-CAC-3-1_L30) achieved high predictive accuracy in identifying samples with a Gleason score >/= 7 and staging disease beyond IIA, supporting that the 5'tRF fingerprint in semen sEV can improve the PSA predictive value to discriminate between malignant and indolent prostate conditions. The in silico study allowed us to map target genes for the four 5'tRFs possibly involved in PCa. Our findings highlight the synergistic use of multiple biomarkers as an efficient approach to improve PCa screening and prognosis."
39336556,Insights into the Two Most Common Cancers of Primitive Gut-Derived Structures and Their Microbial Connections.,"The gastrointestinal and respiratory systems are closely linked in different ways, including from the embryological, anatomical, cellular, and physiological angles. The highest number (and various types) of microorganisms live in the large intestine/colon, and constitute the normal microbiota in healthy people. Adverse alterations of the microbiota or dysbiosis can lead to chronic inflammation. If this detrimental condition persists, a sequence of pathological events can occur, such as inflammatory bowel disease, dysplasia or premalignant changes, and finally, cancer. One of the most commonly identified bacteria in both inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer is Escherichia coli. On the other hand, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at risk of several other diseases-both intestinal (such as malnutrition and intestinal obstruction, besides cancer) and extraintestinal (such as arthritis, bronchiectasis, and cancer risk). Cancers of the lung and colon are the two most common malignancies occurring worldwide (except for female breast cancer). Like the bacterial role in colon cancer, many studies have shown a link between chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and lung cancer. However, in colon cancer, genotoxic colibactin-producing E. coli belonging to the B2 phylogroup may promote tumorigenesis. Furthermore, E. coli is believed to play an important role in the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary colonic site. Currently, seven enteric pathogenic E. coli subtypes have been described. Conversely, three Chlamydiae can cause infections in humans (C. trachomatis may increase the risk of cervical and ovarian cancers). Nonetheless, striking genomic plasticity and genetic modifications allow E. coli to constantly adjust to the surrounding environment. Consequently, E. coli becomes resistant to antibiotics and difficult to manage. To solve this problem, scientists are thinking of utilizing suitable lytic bacteriophages (viruses that infect and kill bacteria). Several bacteriophages of E. coli and Chlamydia species are being evaluated for this purpose."
39336161,Low Magnetic Field Exposure Alters Prostate Cancer Cell Properties.,"Prostate cancer is the second most common neoplasia and fifth-leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide. Electromagnetic and magnetic fields have been classified as possible human carcinogens, but current understanding of molecular and cellular pathways involved is very limited. Effects due to extremely low magnetic/hypomagnetic fields (LMF) are furthermore poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial mediators of cellular communication with multifaceted roles in cancer progression, including via transport and uptake of various protein and microRNA (miRNA) EV-cargoes. miRNAs regulate gene expression and are implicated in cancer-related processes such as proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. This study investigated the effects of LMF exposure (20 nT) by magnetic shielding on the prostate cancer cell line PC3 compared to the prostate epithelial cell line PNT2 under short-term (4 h) conditions. We examined EV profiles following a 4 h LMF exposure alongside associated functional enrichment KEGG and GO pathways for the EV proteomes. The 4 h LMF exposure significantly reduced cellular EV release and modified PC3 EV cargoes to a more inflammatory and metastatic profile, with 16 Disease Pathways and 95 Human Phenotypes associated specifically with the LMF-treated PC3 EV proteomes. These included cancerous, metabolic, blood, skin, cardiac and skeletal Disease Pathways, as well as pain and developmental disorders. In the normal PNT2 cells, less EV protein cargo was observed following LMF exposure compared with cells not exposed to LMF, and fewer associated functional enrichment pathways were identified. This pointed to some differences in various cellular functions, ageing, defence responses, oxidative stress, and disease phenotypes, including respiratory, digestive, immune, and developmental pathways. Furthermore, we analysed alterations in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and miRNAs linked to metastasis, as this is crucial in cancer aggressiveness. The 4 h LMF exposure caused a significant increase in MMP2 and MMP9, as well as in onco-miRs miR-155, miR-210, miR-21, but a significant reduction in tumour-suppressor miRs (miR-200c and miR-126) in the metastatic PC3 cells, compared with normal PNT2 cells. In addition, 4 h LMF exposure significantly induced cellular invasion of PC3 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in magnetic field exposures modulate EV-mediated and miR-regulatory processes in PCa metastasis, providing a basis for exploring novel therapeutic strategies."
39335746,Internal Overview of Prostatic Cancer Cases and Quality of BRCA1 and BRCA2 NGS Data from the FFPE Tissue.,"Background: Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) has gained an important role in patients with advanced prostate cancer following the introduction of PARP inhibitors in daily clinical practice. Here, we report an overview of CGP results, specifically of BRCA1 and BRCA2 HRD-repair system genes, from patients with prostate cancer analyzed in our institution, and we compare our results with those available from more recent scientific literature. Methods: The study cohort consisted of 70 patients. Somatic DNA was extracted from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue using a MagCore Genomic DNA FFPE One-Step Kit for MagCore System. The DNA was quantified by EasyPGX((R)) Real-Time qPCR and EasyPGX((R)) Analysis Software (version 4.0.13). Tissue somatic DNA libraries were prepared with Myriapod((R)) NGS BRCA1-2 panel-NG035 and sequenced in a Mi-Seq((R)) System. The sequence alignment in hg19 and the variant calling were performed using Myriapod((R)) NGS Data Analysis Software version 5.0.8 NG900-SW 5.0.8 with a software detection limit (LoD) of 95%. Variants with a coverage of 500 and VAF% >/= 5 were evaluated. Results: Tumor tissue NGS was unsuccessful in 46/70 patients (66%). Mutations of the BRCA2 gene were detected in 4 of the samples: (1) BRCA2 ex10 c.1244A>G p.His415Arg VAF = 51.03%; (2) BRCA2 ex11 c.5946delT p.Ser1982fs VAF = 72.1%; (3) BRCA2 ex11 c.3302A>G p.His1101Arg VAF = 52.9%; and (4) BRCA2 ex11 c.3195_3198delTAAT p.Asn1066fs VAF = 51.1%. Conclusions: The results from our internal overview seem to support the data and to confirm the performance of the technical issues reported in the literature. Considering the advanced age of our patients, with 84% of men over the age of 65, the application of alternative and less invasive procedures such as liquid biopsy, could be a more suitable solution for some cases."
39335669,Identifying Key Genes as Progression Indicators of Prostate Cancer with Castration Resistance Based on Dynamic Network Biomarker Algorithm and Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis.,"Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer, yet dynamic molecular changes from hormone-sensitive to castration-resistant states in patients treated with ADT remain unclear. Methods: In this study, we combined the dynamic network biomarker (DNB) method and the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key genes associated with the progression to a castration-resistant state in prostate cancer via the integration of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data. Based on the gene expression profiles of CRPC in the GEO dataset, the DNB method was used to clarify the condition of epithelial cells and find out the most significant transition signal DNB modules and genes included. Then, we calculated gene modules associated with the clinical phenotype stage based on the WGCNA. IHC was conducted to validate the expression of the key genes in CRPC and primary PCa patients Results:Nomograms, calibration plots, and ROC curves were applied to evaluate the good prognostic accuracy of the risk prediction model. Results: By combining single-cell RNA sequence data and bulk RNA sequence data, we identified a set of DNBs, whose roles involved in androgen-associated activities indicated the signals of a prostate cancer cell transition from an androgen-dependent state to a castration-resistant state. In addition, a risk prediction model including the risk score of four key genes (SCD, NARS2, ALDH1A1, and NFXL1) and other clinical-pathological characteristics was constructed and verified to be able to reasonably predict the prognosis of patients receiving ADT. Conclusions: In summary, four key genes from DNBs were identified as potential diagnostic markers for patients treated with ADT and a risk score-based nomogram will facilitate precise prognosis prediction and individualized therapeutic interventions of CRPC."
39333696,Therapeutic implications of homologous repair deficiency testing in patients with prostate cancer (Part 2 of 2).,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Unfortunately, not all metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receive available life-prolonging systemic therapies, emphasizing the need to optimize mCRPC treatment selections. Better guidelines are necessary to determine genetic testing for prostate cancer. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this two-part expert opinion-based guide, we provide an expert consensus opinion on the utilization of germline and somatic testing to detect HRR alterations in patients with mCRPC. This guide was developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel that convened in 2023-2024, including representatives from medical oncology, urology, radiation oncology, pathology, medical genomics, and basic science. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In this second part, we highlight how genetic testing can lead to improved, life-prolonging mCRPC therapeutic strategies based on a review of the recent phase III trials and subsequent regulatory approvals for PARP inhibitors in mCRPC."
39332191,FTH1P8 induces and transmits docetaxel resistance by inhibiting ferroptosis in prostate cancer.,"Overcoming docetaxel resistance remains a significant challenge in the management of prostate cancer. Previous studies have confirmed a link between ferroptosis and the development of docetaxel resistance. This study revealed that docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells presented increased FTH1P8 expression compared with docetaxel-sensitive cells. Decreasing the level of FTH1P8 counteracted docetaxel resistance and facilitated docetaxel-induced ferroptosis, which is characterized by an increase in intracellular Fe(2+) concentration, lipid peroxidation levels (lipid ROS), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, malondialdehyde (MDA) production and mitochondrial damage, a decrease in the Fe(3+) concentration and glutathione (GSH) content, and the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical (.OH) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Conversely, increasing the level of FTH1P8 had the opposite effect. A positive correlation was revealed between the expression of FTH1P8 and its parental gene FTH1 in prostate cancer tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Molecular investigations revealed that FTH1P8 expression increased through miR-1252-5p. Furthermore, rescue experiments confirmed that FTH1 mediated the inhibitory effect of FTH1P8 on ferroptosis. Moreover, FTH1P8 was discovered to play a role in the spread of docetaxel resistance via exosomes. Docetaxel-siRNA targeting FTH1P8 (siFTH1P8)-nanoliposomes (DOC-siFTH1P8-LIP), which can codeliver docetaxel and siFTH1P8, significantly inhibited docetaxel resistance in cells. These results indicated that FTH1P8 can function as both an indicator and a treatment target for docetaxel resistance. The use of DOC-siFTH1P8-LIP demonstrated promising therapeutic effects on docetaxel-resistant cells, suggesting a novel option for treating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer."
39331229,Identification of BBC3 as a novel indicator for predicting prostate cancer development and olaparib resistance.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a commonly occurring malignancy in elderly men. Olaparib, a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor, is utilized in PCa treatment. However, patients often develop resistance to olaparib after a period of treatment. Genetic alterations may play a significant role in this resistance, but the specific genes involved remain unclear. This study collected RNA-sequence data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database on both olaparib-sensitive and -resistant PCa cells to identify genes crucial for resistance. Subsequently, the enriched pathways of these genes were analyzed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify hub genes. The effect of these hub genes on PCa occurrence, progression, and prognosis was assessed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and Epigenome Atlas databases. Finally, this study validated our findings in clinical PCa samples and cells. From the GSE189186 dataset, 50 upregulated genes and 2 downregulated genes were identified in olaparib-resistant C4-2B and LNCaP cells. Utilizing the PPI network, eight upregulated genes (BBC3, TP53I3, FDXR, DDB2, CDKN1A, GADD45A, ZMAT3, and SESN1) were identified as hub genes for olaparib-resistant PCa cells. Furthermore, some of these genes were central to PCa occurrence, with BBC3 also influencing progression and prognosis. Importantly, BBC3 expression was upregulated in clinical PCa samples and affected PCa cells sensitive to olaparib, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for PCa development and olaparib resistance."
39330991,Nivolumab in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with and without DNA Repair Defects.,"PURPOSE: Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) across various cancers, their efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is modest, except for a subset of patients who experience significant, yet unpredictable, benefits. DNA repair defects (DRD) are associated with higher neoantigen load, which may predict response. Our study explored the potential of DRD for enhanced responsiveness to the ICI nivolumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II, multicenter, single-arm trial evaluating nivolumab in patients with mCRPC with prior docetaxel therapy. The DRD were assessed using ctDNA. The primary endpoint was PSA50 response. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival. Also, exploratory comprehensive genomic profiling was performed via whole-exome sequencing of tumor samples and matched normal tissues, alongside PD-L1 expression evaluation. RESULTS: Among the 38 enrolled patients, DRD was identifiable in 30.5% (11/36) through ctDNA and/or whole-exome sequencing analyses. The overall PSA50 response rate was 10.5% (4/38). The PSA50 and objective response rates did not significantly differ between patients with and without DRD (18.2% vs. 8%; P = 0.57 and 50% vs. 17.6%; P = 0.27, respectively). The median PSA-PFS (1.9 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.52) and rPFS (3.4 vs. 5.5 months; P = 0.7) were not statistically different between patients with and without DRD. Grade >/= 3 adverse events were reported in 47.3% of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab has clinical activity in a subset of patients with mCRPC; however, DRD does not predict response. These results highlight the necessity of identifying new biomarkers to more accurately determine patients with mCRPC who might respond to ICIs."
39329938,Novel Mutations in AKT1 Gene in Prostate Cancer Patients in Jordan.,"The AKT1 oncogene is related to various cancers due to its critical role in the PIC3CA/AKT1 pathway; however, most of the studies screened the hotspot mutation AKT1 (E17K) with various incidences. Low frequency or lack of AKT1 (E17K) mutation was reported in prostate cancer (PC) patients. This study aims to explore genetic alterations in the AKT1 PH domain by extending the sequencing to include AKT1 gene exons 3 and 4. Genomic DNA was extracted from 84 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded samples of PC patients in Jordan, and then subjected to PCR and sequencing for the targeted exons. This study revealed the presence of two novel mutations (N53Y and Q59K) and a high frequency of mutations in exon 4, with a lack of mutations in the E17K hotspot. Nine missense and two synonymous mutations were detected in exon 4 (Phe27Tyr, Phe27Leu, Ala58Thr, Ser56Phe, Arg41Trp, Phe35Leu, Asp32Glu, Phe35Tyr, and Gln43Lys) and (Ser56 and Glu40), respectively. Two synonymous mutations were detected in exon 3 (Leu12 and Ser2). It is concluded that there is a high frequency of AKT1 mutation in PC patients in Jordan with two novel missense mutations in the Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. E17K hotspot mutation was not detected in any tested samples, which underlined the significant role of mutations in other AKT1 exons in PC development."
39329425,Spatial analysis of microRNA regulation at defined tumor hypoxia levels reveals biological traits of aggressive prostate cancer.,"Mechanisms regulating the gene expression program at different hypoxia severity levels in patient tumors are not understood. We aimed to determine microRNA (miRNA) regulation of this program at defined hypoxia levels from moderate to severe in prostate cancer. Biopsies from 95 patients were used, where 83 patients received the hypoxia marker pimonidazole before prostatectomy. Forty hypoxia levels were extracted from pimonidazole-stained histological sections and correlated with miRNA and gene expression profiles determined by RNA sequencing and Illumina bead arrays. This identified miRNAs associated with moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 28) hypoxia and predicted their target genes. The scores of miRNAs or target genes showed prognostic significance, as validated in an external cohort of 417 patients. The target genes showed enrichment of gene sets for cell proliferation and MYC activation at all hypoxia levels and PTEN inactivation at severe hypoxia. This was confirmed by RT-qPCR for MYC and PTEN, by Ki67 immunohistochemistry, and by gene set analysis in an external cohort. To assess whether miRNA regulation occurred within the predicted hypoxic regions, a method to quantify co-localization of multiple histopathology parameters at defined hypoxia levels was applied. A high Ki67 proliferation index co-localized significantly with hypoxia at all levels. The co-localization index was strongly associated with poor prognosis. Absence of PTEN staining co-localized significantly with severe hypoxia. The scores for miRNAs correlated with the co-localization index for Ki67 staining and hypoxia, consistent with miRNA regulation within the overlapping regions. This was confirmed by showing miR-210-3p expression within severe hypoxia by in situ hybridization. Cell line experiments (22Rv1, PC3) were conducted to determine whether miRNAs and target genes were regulated directly by hypoxia. Most of them were hypoxia-unresponsive, and probably regulated by other mechanisms such as MYC activation. In conclusion, in aggressive, hypoxic prostate tumors, cancer cells exhibit different proliferative gene expression programs that is regulated by miRNAs and depend on whether the cells reside in moderate or severe hypoxic regions.

39328854,Network pharmacology combined with molecular docking revealed the potential targets of Coridius chinensis in prostate cancer treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) has high morbidity and mortality rates in elderly men. With a history of thousands of years, traditional Chinese medicine derived from insects could be an important source for developing cancer-targeted drugs to prevent tumorigenesis, enhance therapeutic effects, and reduce the risk of recurrence and metastasis. Multiple studies have shown that Coridius chinensis (Cc) has anticancer effects. AIM: To elucidate the mechanism of action of Cc against PCa via network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS: Potential targets for Cc and PCa were predicted using ChemDraw 19.0 software, the PharmMapper database and the GeneCards database. Then, the STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction network. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment and molecular docking analyses were subsequently conducted to identify the key targets, active ingredients and pathways involved. RESULTS: GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway was the critical pathway (P value < 1.0 x 10(-8)). Multiple targeting ingredients that can affect multiple pathways in PCa have been identified in Cc. Seven active compounds (asponguanosines A, asponguanine B, asponguanine C, aspongpyrazine A, N-acetyldopamine, aspongadenine B and aspongpyrazine B) were selected for molecular docking with 9 potential targets, and the results revealed that aspongpyrazine A and asponguanosine A are the main components by which Cc affects PCa (affinity<-5 kcal/mol, hydrogen bonding), but more studies are needed. CONCLUSION: We used network pharmacology to predict the bioactive components and important targets of Cc for the treatment of PCa, supporting the development of Cc as a natural anticancer agent."
39328548,Extrachromosomal circular DNA-related SPOCK1 contributes to development and enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer by regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition.,"Prostate cancer is a significant contributor to cancer-related mortality, and the tumor typically develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hence, few effective clinical strategies are available to patients with advanced disease. Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a type of circular DNA originating from the chromosomes but is likely independent of them. Because of its unique structural characteristics, eccDNA has extensive applications as a new biomarker for cancer prevention and treatment. Circle-seq obtains a comprehensive picture of the overall landscape of eccDNA sizes and content in cell populations. In this study, we used Circle-seq and studied the distribution pattern and expression level of eccDNA in prostate cancer. We confirmed that eccDNA is derived from every human chromosome and has sequences from all known types of genomic structures, revealing it is a common mutational element in prostate cancer. We also identified an eccDNA-related gene SPOCK1 that promotes drug resistance, proliferation, and metastasis of many cancers through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism. The SPOCK1-associated eccDNA was highly upregulated in various groups of sequencing results, and SPOCK1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Therefore, SPOCK1 exists as eccDNA in prostate cancer and encourages its development and drug resistance via the EMT mechanism. Our results suggest that upregulated genes in the form of eccDNA are oncogenes in prostate cancer and play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis."
39327017,Intrapatient Intermetastatic Heterogeneity Determined by Triple-Tracer PET Imaging in mCRPC Patients and Correlation to Survival: The 3TMPO Cohort Study.,"Intrapatient intermetastatic heterogeneity (IIH) has been demonstrated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients and is of the utmost importance for radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) eligibility. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of IIH and RPT eligibility in mCRPC patients through a triple-tracer PET imaging strategy. Methods: This was a multisite prospective observational study in which mCRPC patients underwent both (18)F-FDG and (68)Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 PET/CT scans. A third scan with (68)Ga-DOTATATE, a potential biomarker of neuroendocrine differentiation, was performed if an (18)F-FDG-positive/(68)Ga-PSMA-negative lesion was found. Per-tracer lesion positivity was defined as having an uptake at least 50% above that of the liver. IIH prevalence was defined as the percentage of participants having at least 2 lesions with discordant features on multitracer PET. Results: IIH was observed in 81 patients (82.7%), and at least 1 (18)F-FDG-positive/(68)Ga-PSMA-negative lesion was found in 45 patients (45.9%). Of the 37 participants who also underwent (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 6 (16.2%) had at least 1 (68)Ga-DOTATATE-positive lesion. In total, 12 different combinations of lesion imaging phenotypes were observed. On the basis of our prespecified criteria, 52 (53.1%) participants were determined to be eligible for PSMA RPT, but none for DOTATATE RPT. Patients with IIH had a significantly shorter median overall survival than patients without IIH (9.5 mo vs. not reached; log-rank P = 0.03; hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.8). Conclusion: Most mCRPC patients showed IIH, which was associated with shorter overall survival. On the basis of a triple-tracer PET approach, multiple phenotypic combinations were found. Correlation of these imaging phenotypes with genomics and treatment response will be relevant for precision medicine."
39325441,Oral Microbiome and Subsequent Risk of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer.,"IMPORTANCE: The oral microbiota may be involved in development of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), yet current evidence is largely limited to bacterial 16S amplicon sequencing or small retrospective case-control studies. OBJECTIVE: To test whether oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes are associated with subsequent risk of HNSCC development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective nested case-control study among participants providing oral samples in 3 epidemiological cohorts, the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, and the Southern Community Cohort Study. Two hundred thirty-six patients who prospectively developed HNSCC were identified during a mean (SD) of 5.1 (3.6) years of follow-up. Control participants who remained HNSCC free were selected by 2:1 frequency matching on cohort, age, sex, race and ethnicity, and time since oral sample collection. Data analysis was conducted in 2023. EXPOSURES: Characterization of the oral bacterial microbiome using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and the oral fungal microbiome using internal transcribed spacer sequencing. Association of bacterial and fungal taxa with HNSCC was assessed by analysis of compositions of microbiomes with bias correction. Association with red and orange oral pathogen complexes was tested by logistic regression. A microbial risk score for HNSCC risk was calculated from risk-associated microbiota. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was HNSCC incidence. RESULTS: The study included 236 HNSCC case participants with a mean (SD) age of 60.9 (9.5) years and 24.6% women during a mean of 5.1 (3.6) years of follow-up, and 485 matched control participants. Overall microbiome diversity at baseline was not related to subsequent HNSCC risk; however 13 oral bacterial species were found to be differentially associated with development of HNSCC. The species included the newly identified Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Leptotrichia species, as well as several species belonging to beta and gamma Proteobacteria. The red/orange periodontal pathogen complex was moderately associated with HNSCC risk (odds ratio, 1.06 per 1 SD; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12). A 1-SD increase in microbial risk score (created based on 22 bacteria) was associated with a 50% increase in HNSCC risk (multivariate odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.21-1.85). No fungal taxa associated with HNSCC risk were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case-control study yielded compelling evidence that oral bacteria are a risk factor for HNSCC development. The identified bacteria and bacterial complexes hold promise, along with other risk factors, to identify high-risk individuals for personalized prevention of HNSCC."
39324992,Body composition in recurrent prostate cancer and the role of steroidogenic genotype.,"Hormone therapy (HT) to treat prostate cancer is reported to cause adverse changes in body composition. Clinically, interpatient body composition changes are heterogeneous, but the biological and clinical determinants of body composition toxicity are unknown. Herein, we test the hypothesis that inherited polymorphisms in steroidogenic genes are associated with differential changes in body composition after HT. Men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BCR) who received 8 months of LHRH analog (LHRHa) +/- abiraterone acetate (AAP) were eligible if they had: i) CT imaging of L3 prior to and after treatment; and ii) nucleated cells collected. Cardiometabolic co-morbidities were retrospectively extracted. Body composition was measured using an AI-based segmentation tool. Germline DNA whole exome or genome sequencing was performed. In 162 men treated with 8 months of HT, median skeletal muscle mass (SMMi) loss was 6.6% and subcutaneous adipose gain was 12.3%. Men with type 2 diabetes had higher losses of SMMi after treatment (-11.1% vs -6.3%, P = 0.003). For the 150 men with germline NGS, SRD5A2 rs523349 genotype was associated with differential loss in skeletal muscle density after HT, (-1.3% vs -7.1%, P = 0.04). In addition, the HSD3B1 rs104703 genotype was associated with decreased baseline visceral adipose tissue (63.0 cm2/m2 vs 77.9, P = 0.05). In men with BCR, HT induced notable loss of skeletal muscle and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue. An inherited polymorphism in SRD5A2 and T2DM was associated with differential skeletal muscle toxicity. These findings suggest that inherited polymorphisms may contribute to the body composition toxicity observed with HT."
39324671,DNA Methylation-Derived Immune Cell Proportions and Cancer Risk in Black Participants.,"This study describes associations between immune cell types and cancer risk in a Black population; elevated regulatory T-cell proportions that were associated with increased overall cancer and lung cancer risk, and elevated memory B-cell proportions that were associated with increased prostate and all cancer risk."
39323879,"Causality investigation among gut microbiota, immune cells, and prostate diseases: a Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to have a significant role in the pathogenesis and progression of a variety of diseases, including prostate cancer, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Potential links between prostate diseases, immune cells and the gut microbiota have not been adequately investigated. METHODS: MR studies were conducted to estimate the effects of instrumental variables obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 196 gut microbial taxa and 731 immune cells on the risk of prostate diseases. The primary method for analysing causal relationships was inverse variance-weighted (IVW) analysis, and the MR results were validated through various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: MR analysis revealed that 28 gut microbiome taxa and 75 immune cell types were significantly associated with prostate diseases. Furthermore, reverse MR analysis did not support a causal relationship between prostate diseases and the intestinal microbiota or immune cells. Finally, the results of the mediation analysis indicated that Secreting Treg % CD4 Treg, Activated & resting Treg % CD4 Treg, and Mo MDSC AC inhibited the role of the class Mollicutes in reducing the risk of PCa. In prostatitis, CD8+ T cells on EM CD8br hinder the increased risk associated with the genus Eubacterium nodatum group. Interestingly, in BPH, CD28- CD25++CD8br AC and CD16-CD56 on HLA DR+ NK promoted the role of the genus Dorea in reducing the risk of BPH. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complex relationships among the gut microbiota, immune cells and prostate diseases. The involvement of the gut microbiota in regulating immune cells to impact prostate diseases could provide novel methods and concepts for its therapy and management."
39322022,"Investigation of the relationships between eNOS T786C, G894T, intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) gene variations and prostate cancer development and progression.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationships between eNOS T786C, G894T, intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) gene variations and prostate cancer development and progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 88 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and 91 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods were used to determine the genotype distributions of eNOS T786C, G894T, intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) gene variations. RESULTS: In our study, the CC homozygous genotype of eNOS T786C gene variation was determined to be significantly higher in the prostate cancer patient group compared to the healthy control group (OR: 2.343, 95%Cl: 0.990-5.544, p = 0.026), while the CT heterozygous genotype was found to be significantly higher in the healthy control group compared to the prostate cancer patient group was found to be significantly higher (OR: 0.589, 95%Cl: 0.325-1.068, p = 0.041). In addition, while the TT homozygous genotype of the eNOS G894T gene variation was found to be significantly higher in the prostate cancer patient group compared to the healthy control group (OR: 9.068, 95%Cl: 4.396-18.777, p < 0.001), the GT heterozygous genotype was found to be significantly higher in the healthy control group compared to the prostate cancer patient group was determined significantly higher (OR: 0.227, 95%Cl: 0.121-0.427, p < 0.001). For eNOS (4VNTR (4a/b) - G894T) gene variations, aa-TT (p = 0.042) and bb-TT (p < 0.001) haplotype frequencies were significantly higher in the prostate cancer patient group, while aa-GT (p = 0.017), bb-GG (p = 0.049) and bb-GT (p < 0.001) haplotype frequencies were found to be significantly higher in the healthy control group. For eNOS (4VNTR (4a/b) - T786C) gene variations, the bb-CC haplotype frequency was determined to be significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.049), while the bb-CT haplotype frequency was determined to be significantly higher in the control group (p = 0.008). For eNOS (T786C -G894T) gene variations, TT-TT (p < 0.001) and CC-TT (p = 0.025) haplotype frequencies were found to be significantly higher in the patient group. On the other hand, TT-GT (p = 0.002) and CT-GT (p < 0.001) haplotype frequencies were determined to be significantly higher in the control group. The aa genotype of the intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) gene variation was determined to be significantly higher at Gleason score >/=7 compared to Gleason score <7 (OR: 0.184, 95%Cl: 0.050-0.677, p = 0.005). PSA levels were determined significantly higher in patients with Gleason score 7 and above (p = 0.008). The risk of developing prostate cancer was found to be significantly higher in patients carrying the CC homozygous mutant genotype of the eNOS T786C gene variation (p = 0.024) and in patients carrying the TT homozygous genotype of the G894T gene variation (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the CC homozygous genotype of the eNOS T786C gene variation was determined as a genetic risk factor for the development of prostate cancer, while the CT heterozygous genotype was determined as a protective factor against prostate cancer. For the eNOS G894T gene variation, the TT homozygous genotype was determined as a genetic risk factor for the development of prostate cancer, while the GT heterozygous genotype was determined as a protective factor against prostate cancer. Additionally, for eNOS (4VNTR (4a/b) - G894T) gene variations, aa-TT and bb-TT haplotypes have been identified as genetic risk factors for the development of prostate cancer, while aa-GT, bb-GG and bb-GT haplotypes have been identified as protective factors against the disease has been determined. For eNOS (4VNTR (4a/b) - T786C) gene variations, the bb-CC haplotype was determined as a genetic risk factor in the development of prostate cancer, while the bb-CT haplotype was determined as a protective factor against the disease. TT-TT and CC-TT haplotypes for eNOS (T786C -G894T) gene variations have been identified as genetic risk factors for the development of prostate cancer. In contrast, TT-GT and CT-GT haplotypes were found to be protective factors against the disease. The aa genotype of the intron 4 VNTR (4a/b) gene variation has also been identified as an important genetic risk factor in prostate cancer progression. Significantly increased PSA levels in patients with Gleason score 7 and above, and significantly increased PSA levels in patients carrying the CC and TT homozygous mutant genotype for T786C and G894T gene variations were determined as important risk factors. It is thought that the genetic biomarkers in our study may play a role as personalized therapeutic agents in slowing down the development of prostate cancer, increasing the effectiveness of treatment in prostate cancer, affecting the responses to drugs that regulate NO signaling, predetermining genetic predisposition to prostate cancer, and risk assessment in patients with prostate cancer."
39321214,Synthetic Lethal Targeting of CDK12-Deficient Prostate Cancer with PARP Inhibitors.,"PURPOSE: The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), CDK12, is mutated or amplified in multiple cancers. We previously described a subtype of prostate cancer characterized predominantly by frameshift, loss-of-function mutations in CDK12. This subtype exhibits aggressive clinical features. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using isogenic prostate cancer models generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of CDK12, we conducted a chemical library screen of  approximately 1,800 FDA-approved drugs. We inhibited cyclin K and CDK13 and evaluated the effects on PARP inhibitor (PARPi) sensitivity. CDK12 truncation and kinase domain mutations were expressed in cell lines to determine the effects on PARPi sensitivity. Mice bearing control and CDK12-mutant prostate tumors were treated with rucaparib. Finally, we evaluated PSA responses in patients with CDK12 mutations treated with rucaparib on the TRITON2 trial. RESULTS: Cancer cells lacking CDK12 are more sensitive to PARPi than isogenic wild-type cells, and sensitivity depends on the degree of CDK12 inhibition. Inhibiting cyclin K, but not CDK13, also led to PARPi sensitivity and suppressed homologous recombination. CDK12 truncation mutants remained sensitive to PARPi, whereas kinase domain mutants exhibited intermediate sensitivity. The PARPi rucaparib suppressed tumor growth in mice bearing CDK12-mutated tumors. Finally, 6 of 11 (55%) patients with prostate cancer with biallelic CDK12 mutations had reductions in serum PSA levels when treated with rucaparib on the TRITON2 clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: In prostate cancer, sensitivity to PARPi is dependent on the specific type and zygosity of the CDK12 mutation. PARPi monotherapy may have some activity in patients with prostate cancer with biallelic inactivating CDK12 alterations."
39320917,Proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape of localized prostate cancer unveils distinct molecular subtypes and insights into precision therapeutics.,"Building upon our previous investigation of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiles of prostate cancer in China, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of 82 tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues from 41 Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer. We identified three distinct proteomic subtypes with significant difference in both molecular features and clinical prognosis. Notably, these proteomic subtypes exhibited a parallel degree of heterogeneity in the phosphoproteome, featuring unique metabolism, proliferation, and immune infiltration characteristics. We further demonstrated that a combination of proteins and phosphosites serves as the most effective biomarkers in prostate cancer to predict biochemical recurrence. Through an integrated multiomics analysis, we revealed mechanistic differences underlying different proteomic subtypes and highlighted the potential significance of Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) phosphorylation in promoting the malignant characteristics of prostate cancer cells. Our multiomics data provide valuable resources for understanding the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer within the Chinese population, which have the potential to inform the development of personalized treatment strategies and enhance prognostic analyses for prostate cancer patients."

39319523,Potentially functional variants of PARK7 and DDR2 in ferroptosis-related genes predict survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. It is recognized increasingly for its pivotal role in both cancer development and the response to cancer treatments. We assessed associations between 370,027 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 467 ferroptosis-related genes and survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial served as our discovery dataset, while the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study used as our validation dataset. For SNPs that remained statistically significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in both datasets, we employed a multivariable stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with the PLCO dataset. Ultimately, two independent SNPs, PARK7 rs225120 C>T and DDR2 rs881127 T>C, were identified with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.32 (95% confidence interval = 1.15-1.52, p = .0001) and 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.09-1.64, p = .006) for OS, respectively. We aggregated these two SNPs into a genetic score reflecting the number of unfavorable genotypes (NUG) in further multivariable analysis, revealing a noteworthy association between increased NUG and diminished OS (p(trend) = .001). Additionally, an expression quantitative trait loci analysis indicated that PARK7 rs225120T genotypes were significantly associated with higher PARK7 mRNA expression levels in both whole blood and normal lung tissue. Conversely, DDR2 rs881127C genotypes were significantly associated with lower DDR2 mRNA expression levels in normal lung tissue. Our findings suggest that genetic variants in the ferroptosis-related genes PARK7 and DDR2 are associated with NSCLC survival, potentially through their influence on gene expression levels."
39319183,Causal Relationship Between Mood Swing and Gynecological Disorders: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"BACKGROUND: Gynecological disorders are a wide range of health problems affecting the female reproductive system, which poses substantial health challenges worldwide. Increasing number of observational studies have associated mood instability to common female diseases, but the underlying causal relationship remains unclear. In this work, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was applied to explore the genetically predicted causal relationship of mood swings and several prevalent gynecological disorders. METHODS: Instrumental variables (IVs) of mood swings were selected from UK Biobank (UKB), with 204,412 cases and 247,207 controls being incorporated. The genetic variants for female disorders were obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and FinnGen consortium. To avoid biases caused by racial difference, only European population was included here. Five strong analytical methodologies were used to increase the validity of the results, the most substantial of which was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. Pleiotropy, sensitivity, and heterogeneity were assessed to strengthen the findings. RESULTS: We found mood swings was significantly positively associated with risk of endometrial cancer (OR= 2.60 [95% CI= 1.36, 4.95], P= 0.0037), cervical cancer (OR= 1.01[95% CI= 1.00,1.02], P= 0.0213) and endometriosis (OR= 2.58 [95% CI= 1.18, 5.60], P= 0.0170) by IVW method. However, there was no causal relationship between mood swing and ovarian cancer. No pleiotropy and heterogeneity existed and sensitivity tests were passed. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that mood swing may serve as a genetically predicted causal risk factor for endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, and endometriosis in the European population, while no such association was observed for ovarian cancer. These findings make up for observational research's inherent limitations and may improve patient outcomes in the field of gynecological health. However, the study's focus on European populations may limit the applicability of these results globally."
39318781,"Mechanisms of action of Sappan lignum for prostate cancer treatment: network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental validation.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men globally. Sappan lignum, which exists in the heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan L., has antitumor effects; however, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. This study elucidated the underlying mechanisms of Sappan lignum in PCa through network pharmacology approaches and molecular docking techniques. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of Sappan lignum on PCa were verified through in vitro experiments. METHODS: The constituent ingredients of Sappan lignum were retrieved from the HERB database. Active plant-derived compounds of Sappan lignum were screened based on gastrointestinal absorption and gastric drug properties. Disease targets for PCa were screened using unpaired and paired case datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Intersection targets were used for gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Core targets were identified through topological analysis parameters and their clinical relevance was validated through The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The affinity between the phytochemicals of Sappan lignum and core proteins was verified using the molecular docking technique. Validation experiments confirmed the significant potential of Sappan lignum in treating PCa. RESULTS: Twenty-one plant-derived compounds of Sappan lignum and 821 differentially expressed genes associated with PCa were collected. Among 32 intersection targets, 8 were screened according to topological parameters. KEGG analysis indicated that the antitumor effects of Sappan lignum on PCa were primarily associated with the p53 pathway. The molecular docking technique demonstrated a strong affinity between 3-deoxysappanchalcone (3-DSC) and core proteins, particularly cyclin B1 (CCNB1). CCNB1 expression correlated with clinicopathological features in patients with PCa. Experimental results revealed that 3-DSC exhibited anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and pro-apoptotic effects on 22RV1 and DU145 cells while also causing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, potentially through modulating the p53/p21/CDC2/CCNB1 pathway. CONCLUSION: This research highlights the promising therapeutic potential of Sappan lignum in treating PCa, with a particular focus on targeting the p53 pathway."
39317812,Real-world application of comprehensive genomic profiling for gynecological malignancies: a multicenter observational study.,"BACKGROUND: The actual status of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) applications in Japan has not been clarified. We conducted a multicenter study to investigate the real-world application of CGP in gynecological malignancies. METHODS: Nine designated cancer hospitals participated in this study. Patients who underwent CGP in 2020-2021 were assigned to the CGP group (n = 134). For the population that would have been eligible for CGP, patients who received initial treatment in 2015-2016 and were either alive with disease or died of disease at 5 years follow up were included in the control group (n = 316). We compared clinicopathological characteristics including tumor type (cervix, corpus, ovary, and others including sarcoma) and age. We also investigated the context of CGP-recommended treatment. RESULTS: The CGP group had significantly fewer cervical cases and more others cases (cervix/corpus/ovary/others: CGP, 22/44/56/12; control, 89/79/142/6; p = 0.0003). The CGP group was significantly younger than the control group (median: CGP, 54.0; control, 65.0; p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses revealed that patients with cervical and ovarian cancers were significantly younger in the CGP group. Among the CGP group, 17 patients (12.7%) received CGP-recommended treatments, 15 of which were not covered by public insurance. The survival time after CGP in 17 patients was longer than in the other 117 cases (median 21 vs. 11 months). CONCLUSION: There was significant selection bias in tumor type and age for the application of CGP for gynecological malignancies in clinical practice in Japan. While CGP often recommended drugs not covered by public insurance, prognosis can be improved by use of CGP."
39317706,Cervical cancer microbiome analysis: comparing HPV 16 and 18 with other HPV types.,"Differences in the cervicovaginal microbiome may influence the persistence of HPV and therefore, the progression to cervical cancer. We aimed to analyze and compare the metatranscriptome of cervical cancers positive for HPV 16 and 18 with those positive for other HPV types to understand the microbiome's influence on oncogenicity. RNA sequencing data from a total of 222 invasive cervical cancer cases (HPV16/18 positive (n=42) and HPV ""Other types"" (n=180)) were subjected to taxonomy classification (Kraken 2) including bacteria, virus and fungi to the level of species. With a median depth of 288,080.5 reads per sample, up to 107 species (38 bacterial, 16 viral and 53 fungal) were identified. Diversity analyses revealed no significant differences in viral or fungal species between HPV16/18 and other HPV types. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly higher in the ""Other HPV types"" group for the Observed index (p=0.0074) (but not for Shannon). Cumulative species curves revealed greater species diversity in the ""Other HPV types"" group compared to ""HPV16/18 but no significant differences in species abundance were found between HPV groups. The study did not detect strong significant microbiome differences between HPV 16/18 and other HPV types in cervical cancers. Further research is necessary to explore potential factors influencing the oncogenicity of different HPV types and their interaction with the cervical microbiome."
39316497,Identification of Cancer Driver Genes based on Dynamic Incentive Model.,"Cancer is a complex genomic mutation disease, and identifying cancer driver genes promotes the development of targeted drugs and personalized therapies. The current computational method takes less consideration of the relationship among features and the effect of noise in protein-protein interaction(PPI) data, resulting in a low recognition rate. In this paper, we propose a cancer driver genes identification method based on dynamic incentive model, DIM. This method firstly constructs a hypergraph to reduce the impact of false positive data in PPI. Then, the importance of genes in each hyperedge in hypergraph is considered from three perspectives, network and functional score(NFS) is proposed. By analyzing the relation among features, the dynamic incentive model is proposed to fuse NFS, the differential expression score of mRNA and the differential expression score of miRNA. DIM is compared with some classical methods on breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and pan-cancer datasets. The results show that DIM has the best performance on statistical evaluation indicators, functional consistency and the partial area under the ROC curve, and has good cross-cancer capability."
39315592,Real-world genome profiling in Japanese patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma focusing on HRD implications.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses significant challenges due to its high mortality, making it a critical area of research. This retrospective observational study aimed to analyze real-world data from comprehensive genome profiling (CGP) of Japanese patients with PDAC, mainly focusing on differences in gene detection rates among panels and the implications for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. This study enrolled 2568 patients with PDAC who had undergone CGP between June 2019 and December 2021 using data from the nationwide Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics database. Two types of CGP assays (tissue and liquid biopsies) were compared and a higher detection rate of genetic abnormalities in tissue specimens was revealed. HRD-related gene alterations were detected in 23% of patients, with BRCA1/2 mutations accounting for 0.9% and 2.9% of patients, respectively. Treatment outcome analysis indicated that patients with BRCA1/2 mutations had a longer time to treatment discontinuation with FOLFIRINOX than gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy (9.3 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.028). However, no significant differences were observed in the treatment response among the other HRD-related genes. Logistic regression analysis identified younger age and family history of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers as predictive factors for HRD-related gene alterations. Despite the lack of progression-free survival data and the inability to discriminate between germline and somatic mutations, this study provides valuable insights into the clinical implications of CGP in Japanese patients with PDAC. Further research is warranted to optimize panel selection and elucidate the efficacy of platinum-based therapies depending on the HRD status."
39312452,Epigenetics of Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer Prevention: Fact or Fiction.,"Cancer development takes 10 to 50 years, and epigenetics plays an important role. Recent evidence suggests that ~80% of human cancers are linked to environmental factors impinging upon genetics/epigenetics. Because advanced metastasized cancers are resistant to radiation/chemotherapeutic drugs, cancer prevention by relatively nontoxic ""epigenetic modifiers"" will be logical. Many dietary phytochemicals possess powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are hallmarks of cancer prevention. Dietary phytochemicals can regulate gene expression of the cellular genome via epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we will summarize preclinical studies that demonstrate epigenetic mechanisms of dietary phytochemicals in skin, colorectal, and prostate cancer prevention. Key examples of the importance of epigenetic regulation in carcinogenesis include hypermethylation of the NRF2 promoter region in cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of NRF2-ARE signaling. Many dietary phytochemicals demethylate NRF2 promoter region and restore NRF2 signaling. Phytochemicals can also inhibit inflammatory responses via hypermethylation of inflammation-relevant genes to block gene expression. Altogether, dietary phytochemicals are excellent candidates for cancer prevention due to their low toxicity, potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and powerful epigenetic effects in reversing procarcinogenic events."
39312339,"Immunoprognostic analysis of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 in patients with cervical cancer.","The incidence of cervical cancer is increasing. Immunotherapies show better patient outcomes than monotherapies; however, the mainstay treatment for cervical cancer remains surgery and chemotherapy. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) acts on multiple tryptophan substrates, exhibiting antitumor, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. Despite the association of elevated IDO1 expression with unfavorable outcomes in various cancers, its precise function in cervical cancer remains ambiguous. Here, we explored the prognostic significance of IDO1 in cervical carcinoma. Gene expression datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used for differential expression and functional correlation analyses. Using Human Protein Atlas alongside Tumor-Immune System Interaction Database, we assessed the association of IDO1 with survival rates. Given the link between cervical cancer prognosis and immune invasion, CIBERSORT was used to assess the connection between immune cells and IDO1, while the percentage of tumor-penetrating immune cells based on IDO1 expression in cervical cancer patients was analyzed using Tumor-Immune System Interaction Database. Incorporating a clinicopathological characteristic-based risk score model with IDO1 risk score, we devised a nomogram to predict cervical cancer patient survival. The effects of IDO1 in immune regulation and its prognostic significance were validated using data from patients with cervical cancer obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive database. Compared with that in normal cervical tissues, IDO1 expression was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and significantly correlated with cervical cancer progression and prognosis. IDO1 expression showed a positive association with monocyte and macrophage abundance, while exhibiting a negative correlation with that of endothelial cells and eosinophils. Cox regression analyses highlighted IDO1 as the core immune gene implicated in cervical cancer. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed an association of IDO1 with the metabolic pathways of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that elevated IDO1 expression correlates markedly with cervical cancer outcomes, suggesting it as a promising therapeutic target. The Cancer Imaging Archive data analysis revealed that the impact of anti-PD1 and CTLA4 therapy is more pronounced in cervical cancer patients exhibiting elevated IDO1 expression. IDO1 is a potential target for immunotherapy for cervical cancer."
39310847,"Region of interest localization, tissue storage time, and antibody binding density-a technical note on the GeoMx(R) Digital Spatial Profiler.","BACKGROUND: Spatial biology is an emerging concept to interrogate tumor heterogeneity. The NanoString GeoMx(R) Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) platform has become increasingly available. It combines high-plex analysis of protein or messenger RNA expression using barcoded antibodies or oligonucleotide probes with investigator-driven selection of regions of interest. Cell populations, e.g. immune cells, can be selectively analyzed via segmentation. A key advantage is the use of archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, however, begging the question whether and to what extent tissue fixation and storage time affect the results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibody binding density (ABD), i.e. the number of barcodes/mum(2), is a key quality control measure for DSP spatial proteomics. To assess whether regional differences in tissue fixation have an influence on ABD, we compared 652 regions of interest selected from tumor center and periphery of 49 prostate cancer and 25 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens. Moreover, the effect of tissue storage time on ABD was examined. Finally, we tested whether regional differences have an influence on ABD of segmented CD45+ or CD8+ cells. RESULTS: No significant differences in ABD between tumor center and periphery were found in prostate cancer or RCC. However, ABD was significantly higher in recent specimens (</=5 years) when compared with those that were older (>5 years; P = 0.027). There was a trend towards higher ABD in the tumor periphery of RCC specimens after segmentation for immune cells, albeit without reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: The NanoString GeoMx(R) DSP platform delivers robust data to interrogate tumor heterogeneity, but tissue storage time should be considered when interpreting the results."
39310280,UQCRB and LBH are correlated with Gleason score progression in prostate cancer: Spatial transcriptomics and experimental validation.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifocal disease characterized by genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity within a single gland. In this study, Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis was applied to PCa tissues with different histological structures to infer the molecular events involved in Gleason score (GS) progression. The spots in tissue sections were classified into various groups using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Louvain clustering analysis based on transcriptome data. Anotation of the spots according to GS revealed notable similarities between transcriptomic profiles and histologically identifiable structures. The accuracy of macroscopic GS determination was bioinformatically verified through malignancy-related feature analysis, specifically inferred copy number variation (inferCNV), as well as developmental trajectory analyses, such as diffusion pseudotime (DPT) and partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA). Genes related to GS progression were identified from the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through pairwise comparisons of groups along a GS gradient. The proteins encoded by the representative oncogenes UQCRB and LBH were found to be highly expressed in advanced-stage PCa tissues. Knockdown of their mRNAs significantly suppressed PCa cell proliferation and invasion. These findings were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset, as well as through histological and cytological experiments. The results presented here establish a foundation for ST-based evaluation of GS progression and provide valuable insights into the GS progression-related genes UQCRB and LBH."
39308687,Pan-cancer analysis of the role of alpha2C-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2C) in human tumors and validation in glioblastoma multiforme models.,"Background: Several studies have reported the relationship between alpha2C-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2C) and both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis is currently lacking. Methods: Utilizing the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the roles of ADRA2C in human pan-cancer were analyzed through a variety of bioinformatics approaches, including R programming language and single-cell sequencing data analysis, et al. Besides, cell migration assay and immunochemistry were employed to further validate the role of ADRA2C in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines and GBM mouse model. Results: A total of 33 cancer types were involved in this study. It was revealed that the expression level of ADRA2C varied across different clinical stages in patients with breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESCA), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Meanwhile, it was found that ADRA2C may play roles in prognosis of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma (GBM-LGG), and uveal melanoma (UVM). Functional enrichment analysis suggested that ADRA2C expression level was highly correlated with neuronal system-related pathways. Moreover, ADRA2C may be a promising diagnostic marker for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), GBM, GBMLGG, kidney chromophobe (KICH), and KIRP. Additionally, ADRA2C expression level was correlated with the levels of several infiltrating cells and immune checkpoint genes. Besides, the single-cell sequencing data analysis indicated that ADRA2C played a role in multiple tumor development processes in GBM, retinoblastoma (RB), and UVM. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the expression level of ADRA2C may be associated with glioma cell migration, apoptosis, and invasion. Conclusion: ADRA2C exhibited to play a notable role in several cancer types, suggesting that ADRA2C could serve as a promising biomarker or target for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, particularly for GBM."
39308337,Prognosis and immunotherapeutic implications of molecular classification of cervical cancer based on immunophenoscore-related genes.,"The immunophenoscore (IPS) is an important indicator for evaluating immunotherapy response. This work was designed to establish a prognostic model based on IPS-related genes in cervical cancer. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to identify key modules related to IPS in cervical cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results show that the yellow module (158 genes) had a high correlation with both IPS_CTLA4_blocker and IPS_CTLA4_and PC1/PDL1/PDL2 blocker. Univariate cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were performed based on 158 genes, and 9 characteristic genes were finally identified to construct the model. According to the differentially expressed genes, cervical cancer samples were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups and cluster 1.2.3. Higher risk scores associated with poorer prognosis. cluster2 and cluster3 were identified as cervical cancer subtypes with significant survival differences. cluster2 had higher immune cell infiltration levels and better prognosis, with greater sensitivity to Cyclopamine, Imatinib, MG-13, Paclitaxel, PHA-665752, Rapamycin, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and VX-680. In contrast, cluster3 had higher TTN and PIK3CA mutations and greater sensitivity to AZ628, Dasatinib, Doxorubicin, HG-6-64-1, JQ12, Midostaurin, PF-562271, TAE684, and WH-4-023. In conclusion, we developed a feasible risk score model based on IPS-related genes for cervical cancer prognosis and identified potential drugs for different cervical cancer subtypes."
39307844,Relevance of the common-sense model for people living with a genetic predisposition for breast and ovarian cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants have been associated with an increased risk for breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate cancer as well as melanoma. The present research uses the Leventhal's common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM), a theoretical framework highlighting the role of mental representations on responses to a health-threat. We aim at understanding the personal meaning and representation of living with an hereditary breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews of 15 BRCA carriers were analysed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Mental representations develops in childhood and are influenced by childhood emotional responses to the familial experience of the BRCA predisposition. Pre-existing beliefs about BRCA, even erroneous, are deeply anchored and not called into question by medical informations given during the genetic counselling. This is particularly true when medical information is perceived as too complex, inconsistent or in contradiction with familial experience. These beliefs about the consequences of being carriers of the BRCA gene influence emotional and behavioural experiences leading to experience fear, anxiety, lack of hope for future or self-identity change. For participants with a traumatic familial experience of cancer, the lack of treatment for this genetic disease generates a perpetual overestimation of cancers' risk and the feeling of an unending danger associated with early death despite breast and ovarian prophylactic surgery. When strong negative representations of the BRCA predisposition are experienced, dysfunctional health behaviours, such as drugs consumption or overuse of medical consultations, could appear consecutively to emotional disorders."
39306731,Causal relationship between folic acid and prostate cancer risk: Insights from Mendelian randomization analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Folic acid is a commonly used dietary supplement of trace element, but it may increase the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between PCa and folic acid supplementation, as well as dietary folate equivalents, using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: The Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data of folic acid supplementation and dietary folate equivalents were selected from UK Biobank. Meta-analysis of GWASs of PCa was obtained from PCa Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium. MR analysis was performed with inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, MR-Egger regression, simple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode analysis. Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests and reverse MR analysis were conducted to assess the robustness and reliability of the causal inference. RESULTS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with folic acid supplementation and five SNPs associated with dietary folate equivalents were identified as instrumental variables. Genetically predicted folic acid supplementation was associated with an increased risk of PCa (OR 1.200, p < 0.001, by IVW method), and there was no evidence of heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, or significant reverse causality (all p > 0.05). In contrast, dietary folate equivalents showed no significant correlation with PCa (p > 0.05 for all five MR methods). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated an association between increased risk of PCa and folic acid supplementation, but not with dietary folate equivalents. These findings have implications for public health interventions and personalized preventive strategies for PCa."
39306478,Intensification Approaches and Treatment Sequencing in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, research on treatment intensification has gathered momentum, and three novel therapy combinations were approved for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This systematic review summarizes the current and emerging evidence around intensified strategies for mCRPC and provides guidance for an ideal therapeutic sequencing. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines were followed to perform this review. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and major international societies' online proceedings were searched comprehensively until May 15, 2024, for terms related to treatment intensification and sequencing for mCRPC. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 28 clinical trials and 24 ongoing studies of intensification treatments were included in this review. Algorithms of optimal sequencing of approved treatments for mCRPC were outlined according to the use of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) with or without docetaxel for earlier disease states. In first line, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor + ARPI combinations improve radiographical progression-free survival (rPFS), particularly for those with BRCA1/2 alterations. The AKT inhibitor combination of ipatasertib + abiraterone extends rPFS in those with PTEN loss or PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations. In those with two or more risk factors for early progression on enzalutamide, radionuclide 177-Lu-PSMA-617 + enzalutamide prolongs progression-free survival. Ongoing research of intensified approaches for mCRPC, and available and potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers are discussed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Recent approvals and ongoing investigations of single agents and intensification approaches will keep transforming the mCRPC treatment landscape. Improvement of patient profiling applying recognized genomic, molecular, and clinical predictive and prognostic indicators is fundamental to optimize sequential use of available therapies."
39297880,"Novel systems biology experimental pipeline reveals matairesinol's antimetastatic potential in prostate cancer: an integrated approach of network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation.","Matairesinol (MAT), a plant lignan renowned for its anticancer properties in hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and prostate cancers, presents a promising yet underexplored avenue in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To elucidate its specific therapeutic targets and mechanisms, our study adopted an integrative approach, amalgamating network pharmacology (NP), bioinformatics, GeneMANIA-based functional association (GMFA), and experimental validation. By mining online databases, we identified 27 common targets of mPC and MAT, constructing a MAT-mPC protein-protein interaction network via STRING and pinpointing 11 hub targets such as EGFR, AKT1, ERBB2, MET, IGF1, CASP3, HSP90AA1, HIF1A, MMP2, HGF, and MMP9 with CytoHuba. Utilizing DAVID, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis highlighted metastasis-related processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, positive regulation of cell migration, and key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including cancer, prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK signaling, while the web resources such as UALCAN and GEPIA2 affirmed the clinical significance of the top 11 hub targets in mPC patient survival analysis and gene expression patterns. Our innovative GMFA enrichment method further enriched network pharmacology findings. Molecular docking analyses demonstrated substantial interactions between MAT and 11 hub targets. Simulation studies confirmed the stable interactions of MAT with selected targets. Experimental validation in PC3 cells, employing quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR and various cell-based assays, corroborated MAT's antimetastatic effects on mPC. Thus, this exhaustive NP analysis, complemented by GMFA, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validations, underscores MAT's multifaceted role in targeting mPC through diverse therapeutic avenues. Nevertheless, comprehensive in vitro validation is imperative to solidify these findings."
39304722,The TbetaRI promotes migration and metastasis through thrombospondin 1 and ITGAV in prostate cancer cells.,"TGFbeta potently modifies the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is thought to favor tumor cell invasion. However, the mechanism whereby the cancer cells employ the ECM proteins to facilitate their motility is largely unknown. In this study we used RNA-seq and proteomic analysis to examine the proteins secreted by castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells upon TGFbeta treatment and found that thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was observed to be one of the predominant proteins. The CRISPR Cas9, or siRNA techniques was used to downregulate TGFbeta type I receptor (TbetaRI) to interfere with TGFbeta signaling in various cancer cells in vitro. The interaction of ECM proteins with the TbetaRI in the migratory prostate cancer cells in response to TGFbeta1 was demonstrated by several different techniques to reveal that THBS1 mediates cell migration by interacting with integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV) and TbetaRI. Deletion of TbetaRI or THBS1 in cancer cells prevented their migration and invasion. THBS1 belongs to a group of tumorigenic ECM proteins induced via TGFbeta signaling in CRPC cells, and high expression of THBS1 in human prostate cancer tissues correlated with the degree of malignancy. TGFbeta-induced production of THBS1 through TbetaRI facilitates the invasion and metastasis of CRPC cells as shown in vivo xenograft animal experiments."
39304265,"Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","BACKGROUND: Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. METHODS: We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. FINDINGS: In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7.3 million [95% UI 6.6-7.8] deaths; 10.7% [9.8-11.3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160.5 million [147.8-171.6] DALYs; 5.6% [5.0-6.1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93.8 million (89.0-99.3) prevalent and 11.9 million (10.7-13.2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65.3% (62.4-67.7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28.8% (28.3-28.8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5.8% (5.7-6.0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88.2% [53.4-117.7]), high ambient temperature (72.4% [51.1 to 179.5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32.1% [26.7-38.1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23.4% [12.7-35.7]), low physical activity (11.3% [1.8-34.9]), high systolic blood pressure (6.7% [2.5-11.6]), lead exposure (6.5% [4.5-11.2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5.3% [0.5-10.5]). INTERPRETATION: Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

39303726,Coagulation factor X promotes resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.,"Although hypercoagulability is commonly associated with malignancies, whether coagulation factors directly affect tumor cell proliferation remains unclear. Herein, by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) of mouse models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we report that immunosuppressive neutrophils (PMN-MDSCs) are a key extra-hepatic source of coagulation factor X (FX). FX activation within the TME enhances androgen-independent tumor growth by activating the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in tumor cells. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of factor Xa (FXa) antagonizes the oncogenic activity of PMN-MDSCs, reduces tumor progression, and synergizes with enzalutamide therapy. Intriguingly, F10(high) PMN-MDSCs express the surface marker CD84 and CD84 ligation enhances F10 expression. Elevated levels of FX, CD84, and PAR2 in prostate tumors associate with worse survival in CRPC patients. This study provides evidence that FXa directly promotes cancer and highlights additional targets for PMN-MDSCs for cancer therapies."
39303635,Exploring the impact of estrogenic endocrine disruptors on cervical cancer progression: A transcriptome analysis and prognostic model development.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally. The detrimental health effects of estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EED), such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, are recognized, but their role in cervical cancer progression remains unclear. To investigate this, a transcriptome analysis using bioinformatics was conducted. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) identified estrogen-responsive genes (ERGs) associated with EED. Cervical cancer expression and clinical data were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The limma package identified differentially expressed ERGs (DERGs), which were further analyzed for molecular mechanisms through enrichment analysis. LASSO regression developed a prognostic risk score model, and COX analysis identified prognostic biomarkers. ssGSEA assessed immune tumor infiltration, and Autodock performed molecular docking. A total of 217 DERGs were linked to endocrine resistance, estrogen signaling, and the cell cycle. The prognostic risk score and nomogram based on DERGs were highly predictive of cervical cancer prognosis and could serve as independent risk factors. The risk score influenced the tumor immune microenvironment by affecting immune cell presence. SCARA3 and FASN emerged as independent prognostic factors, with molecular docking confirming strong binding between EED and FASN. DERGs can aid in creating a reliable prognostic model and predicting overall survival in cervical cancer patients, offering new insights into the impact of EED on cancer progression and highlighting environmental factors related to cancer risks and development."
39300912,A Genome Wide CRISPR Screen Reveals That HOXA9 Promotes Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.,"Androgen receptor inhibitors are commonly used for prostate cancer treatment, but acquired resistance is a significant problem. Codeletion of RB and p53 is common in castration resistant prostate cancers, however they are difficult to target pharmacologically. To comprehensively identify gene loss events that contribute to enzalutamide response, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. This revealed novel genes implicated in resistance that are largely unstudied. Gene loss events that confer enzalutamide sensitivity are enriched for GSEA categories related to stem cell and epigenetic regulation. We investigated the myeloid lineage stem cell factor HOXA9 as a candidate gene whose loss promotes sensitivity to enzalutamide. Cancer genomic data reveals that HOXA9 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and characteristics of advanced prostate cancer. In cell culture, HOXA9 depletion sensitizes cells to enzalutamide, whereas overexpression drives enzalutamide resistance. Combination of the HOXA9 inhibitor DB818 with enzalutamide demonstrates synergy. This demonstrates the utility of our CRISPR screen data in discovering new approaches for treating enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer."
39299701,Collapsed State Mediates the Low Fidelity of the DNA Polymerase beta I260 Mutant.,"DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) fills single nucleotide gaps during base excision repair. Deficiencies in Pol beta can lead to increased mutagenesis and genomic instability in the cell, resulting in cancer. Our laboratory has previously shown that the I260 M somatic mutation of Pol beta, which was first identified in prostate cancer, has reduced nucleotide discrimination in a sequence context-dependent manner. I260 M incorporates the incorrect G opposite A in this context more readily than WT. To identify the molecular mechanism of the reduced fidelity of I260M, we studied incorporation using single turnover kinetics and the nature and rates of conformational changes using steady-state fluorescence and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Our data indicate that the I260 M mutation affects the fingers region of rat Pol beta by creating a ""collapsed"" state in both the open (in the absence of nucleotide) and closed (prior to chemistry) states. I260 M is a temperature-sensitive mutator and binds nucleotides tighter than the WT protein, resulting in reduced fidelity compared to the WT. Additionally, we have generated a kinetic model of WT and I260 M using FRET and single turnover data, which demonstrates that I260 M precatalytic conformation changes differ compared to the WT as it is missing a precatalytic noncovalent step. Taken together, these results suggest that the collapsed state of I260 M may decrease its ability for nucleotide discrimination, illustrating the importance of the ""fingers closing"" conformational change for polymerase fidelity and accurate DNA synthesis."
39296545,mtPCDI: a machine learning-based prognostic model for prostate cancer recurrence.,"BACKGROUND: This research seeks to formulate a prognostic model for forecasting prostate cancer recurrence by examining the interaction between mitochondrial function and programmed cell death (PCD). METHODS: The research involved analyzing four gene expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using univariate Cox regression. These analyses identified genes linked with mitochondrial function and PCD that correlate with recurrence prognosis. Various machine learning algorithms were then employed to construct an optimal predictive model. RESULTS: A key outcome was the creation of a mitochondrial-related programmed cell death index (mtPCDI), which effectively predicts the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. It was observed that individuals with lower mtPCDI exhibited higher immune activity, correlating with better recurrence outcomes. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that mtPCDI can be used for personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making, highlighting its clinical significance and providing insights into the biological processes affecting prostate cancer recurrence."
39294825,Tumor endothelium-derived PODXL correlates with immunosuppressive microenvironment and poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.,"Podocalyxin-like protein (PODXL) is known to originate from tumor cells in several cancers; however, which cell type it is expressed in, whether and how it may contribute to tumor progression after radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer (CC) remain unknown. In this study, we investigated these issues using a cohort of 180 immune stain data, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 29,453 cells, and bulk RNA sequencing data from 187 cervical cancer samples treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed that PODXL was predominantly expressed in tumor endothelial cells (TECs) of CC, which was corroborated by tumor section staining. Moreover, the PODXL expression level was negatively associated with progression-free survival and overall survival of 180 CC patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (both p < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with PODXL(low) TECs, PODXL(high) TECs exhibited a diminished anti-tumor immune response and enhanced tumor-promoting features characteristics. In addition, PODXL over-expression was also found to be negatively associated with immune response and indicated poor survival in bulk RNA sequencing data of CC treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. These results underscore the role of PODXL in CC, suggesting it as a promising target and prognostic marker for patients treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy."
39294534,Screening and identification of susceptibility genes for cervical cancer via bioinformatics analysis and the construction of an mitophagy-related genes diagnostic model.,"PURPOSE: This study aims to utilize bioinformatics methods to systematically screen and identify susceptibility genes for cervical cancer, as well as to construct and validate an mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) diagnostic model. The objective is to increase the understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and improve early diagnosis and treatment. METHOD: We initially collected a large amount of genomic data, including gene expression profile and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, from the control group and Cervical cancer (CC) patients. Through bioinformatics analysis, which employs methods such as differential gene expression analysis and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified a set of candidate susceptibility genes associated with cervical cancer. RESULTS: MRGs were extracted from single-cell RNA sequencing data, and a network graph was constructed on the basis of intercellular interaction data. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms, we constructed a clinical prognostic model and validated and optimized it via extensive clinical data. Through bioinformatics analysis, we successfully identified a group of genes whose expression significantly differed during the development of CC and revealed the biological pathways in which these genes are involved. Moreover, our constructed clinical prognostic model demonstrated excellent performance in the validation phase, accurately predicting the clinical prognosis of patients. CONCLUSION: This study delves into the susceptibility genes of cervical cancer through bioinformatics approaches and successfully builds a reliable clinical prognostic model. This study not only helps uncover potential pathogenic mechanisms of cervical cancer but also provides new directions for early diagnosis and treatment of the disease."
39294262,Frequent CHD1 deletions in prostate cancers of African American men is associated with rapid disease progression.,"We analyzed genomic data from the prostate cancer of African- and European American men to identify differences contributing to racial disparity of outcome. We also performed FISH-based studies of Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) loss on prostate cancer tissue microarrays. We created CHD1-deficient prostate cancer cell lines for genomic, drug sensitivity and functional homologous recombination (HR) activity analysis. Subclonal deletion of CHD1 was nearly three times as frequent in prostate tumors of African American than in European American men and it associates with rapid disease progression. CHD1 deletion was not associated with HR deficiency associated mutational signatures or HR deficiency as detected by RAD51 foci formation. This was consistent with the moderate increase of olaparib and talazoparib sensitivity with several CHD1 deficient cell lines showing talazoparib sensitivity in the clinically relevant concentration range. CHD1 loss may contribute to worse disease outcome in African American men."
39292288,Prediction of undetectable circulating tumor DNA by comprehensive genomic profiling assay in metastatic prostate cancer: the SCRUM-Japan MONSTAR SCREEN project.,"BACKGROUND: Undetectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an obstacle to performing comprehensive genomic profiling in daily practice to identify genomic alterations. We investigated the associations between clinicopathological factors and undetectable ctDNA using a commercially available comprehensive genomic profiling assay in metastatic prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with systemic treatment for metastatic prostate cancer were included. ctDNA was analyzed by FoundationOne((R))Liquid CDx at enrollment. The associations between clinicopathological characteristics and ctDNA detection were analyzed. RESULTS: The number of bone metastasis was associated with ctDNA detection (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 13.6 [1.71-108], P = 0.014). An algorithm predicting ctDNA detection using clinicopathological parameters was created. If >/= 4 bone metastases were observed, ctDNA detection was estimated to be 98.9%. Among the patients with < 4 bone metastases, if two or three features among ISUP grade group 5, PSA level >/= 10 ng/ml, and castration resistance were present, the ctDNA detection rate was 96.7% while the ctDNA detection rate was 86.3% if no or only one feature was present. CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm created in this study is helpful in determining when to undertake comprehensive genomic profiling assay using blood."
39290119,A Comparative Analysis of Computational Strategies in Multi-Epitope Vaccine Design Against Human Papillomavirus and Cervical Cancer.,"Given the critical role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the cause of cervical cancer and other malignancies, there is a need for innovative approaches to preventing this infection. It has been shown that immunoinformatics is an important strategy in computational vaccinology. It is used to design new multi-epitope vaccines against different types of HPV and subsequent cervical cancer. This paper reviews the scope of the entire computational pipeline of HPV vaccine design, starting from data analysis at the genomic and proteomic levels and continuing to epitope predictions of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The search strategy was based on investigating original articles published in ""Google Scholar"" and ""PubMed"" from 2015 to 2023-2024. The terms ""Immunoinformatics"", ""Bioinformatics"", ""Human papillomavirus (HPV)"", ""Vaccine design"", ""In silico vaccine design"", ""Multi-epitope vaccine design"", ""Vaccinology"" and ""HPV vaccine"" were used to for this purpose. We discussed various essential tools involved in the computational design of the vaccine process, e.g., sequence analysis, epitope prediction, conservancy analysis, tertiary structure modeling, refinement, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and in silico cloning. This review article describes immunoinformatics methods that facilitate the design of a multi-epitope vaccine against HPV. However, this pipeline can also be used to design novel chimeric vaccines for other pathogens."
39289166,"Cervical cytology abnormalities and associated genotype patterns of High-Risk HPV Infection in Women of Tripura, North-East India: A Hospital-Based Study.","The current study explored HPV prevalence and age variation in cervical samples of different cytological categories and HPV types from women seeking gynecological care in Tripura, northeast India. Pap smears, cervical tissues, and HPV/DNA specimens were collected from gynecological outpatient departments (OPD) or in-house patients and were screened for HPV16, HPV18, and other HPV types by PCR. Finally, logistic regression was performed to find the association between epidemiologic factors and HPV infection in women of different cytological grades. About 90% of HPV-screened women were found to be HPV positive. HPV16 was most common in HPV-positive women (53.27%), followed by HPV16/18 co-infection (26.17%). HPV16 or HPV18 was most frequent (86.45%) compared to others (13.55%). Among the confirmed cytological tests 68.83% showed normal cytology and 37.17% showed atypical abrasions. Among the abnormal cytology participants, 94.37% were HPV-positive, and 42.25% had cervical cancer. The prevalence of HPV increased with cytological abnormalities (p < 0.01). Abnormal cytological lesions increased with age (p trend = 0.017). Among all epidemiologic factors studied, parity was strongly associated with overall HPV infection, regardless of cytological status. Observed very high frequency of HPV infection in the current study, warrants further investigations."

39287922,Evaluation of circulating plasma proteins in prostate cancer using mendelian randomization.,"BACKGROUND: The proteome is an important resource for exploring potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancer. This study aimed to investigate the causal associations between plasma proteins and prostate cancer (PCa), and to explore the downstream phenotypes that plasma proteins may influence and potential upstream intervening factors. METHODS: Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization was used to investigate the causal effects of plasma proteins on PCa. Colocalization analysis examined the common causal variants between plasma proteins and PCa. Summary-statistics-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analyses identified associations between the expression of protein-coding genes and PCa. Phenome-wide association study was performed to explore the effect of target proteins on downstream phenotypes. Finally, a systematic Mendelian randomization analysis between lifestyle factors and plasma proteins was performed to assess upstream intervening factors for plasma proteins. RESULTS: The findings revealed a positive genetic association between the predicted plasma levels of nine proteins and an elevated risk of PCa, while four proteins exhibited an inverse association with PCa risk. SMR analyses revealed ZG16B, PEX14 in blood and ZG16B, NAPG in prostate tissue were potential drug targets for PCa. The genetic association of PEX14 with PCa was further supported by colocalization analysis. Further Phenome-wide association study showed possible side effects of ZG16B, PEX14 and NAPG as drug targets. 10 plasma proteins (RBP7, TPST1, NFASC, LAYN, HDGF, SERPIMA5, DLL4, EFNA3, LIMA1, and CCL27) could be modulated by lifestyle-related factors. CONCLUSION: This study explores the genetic associations between plasma proteins and PCa, provides evidence that plasma proteins serve as potential drug targets and enhances the understanding of the molecular etiology, prevention and treatment of PCa."
39287260,Identification of the shared gene MXD3 signatures and biological mechanism in patients with hip pain and prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PRAD) is recognized as having a significant effect on systemic illnesses. This study examined possible immune cells, metabolic pathways, and genes that may explain the interaction between PRAD and hip pain. We used information retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. To find common genes, we utilized differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The genes that were shared were subjected to pathway enrichment studies using Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Additionally, hub genes were analyzed using LASSO regression, and a receiver operating characteristic curve was generated based on the screening outcomes. The genes for the nodes were chosen in a protein-protein interaction network that was built. Single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed hub gene expression, and single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis assessed immune cell infiltration. We concluded by comparing MAX dimerization protein 3 (MXD3) and MAX interactor 1 (MXI1) expression in tumor tissues using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection and violin plots in the Tumor lmmune Single-cell Hub database. After analyzing the intersection of the differentially expressed genes and weighted gene co-expression network analysis-significant module genes, we determined that MXD3 was the best shared diagnostic biomarker for PRAD and hip pain. One potential predictor of PRAD development was the MXI1 node gene, which was found in the protein-protein interaction network. The analyses revealed that MXD3 had a relatively positive correlation with neutrophil and T-helper cell infiltration levels, whereas MXI1 had a negative correlation with mast and Tgd cell levels. Tumors had lower levels of MXI1 expression and higher levels of MXD3 expression compared to normal tissues. Endothelial cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and smooth muscle cells were all found to express MXI1. This is the first study to investigate the close genetic link between hip pain and PRAD using bioinformatics technologies. The 2 most significant genes involved in crosstalk between PRAD and hip pain were MXD3 and MXI1. The immunological responses triggered by T cells, mast cells, and neutrophils may be crucial in the relationship between PRAD and hip pain."
39287149,Highly Efficient Synergistic Chemotherapy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Targeted Ovarian Cancer Therapy Using Hyaluronic Acid-Coated Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles.,"The diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer (OC) are still a grand challenge, more than 70% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with a dismal prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown superior results to other examinations in preoperative assessment, while cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for OC. However, few previous studies have brought together the two rapidly expanding fields. Here a technique is presented using cisplatin prodrug (Pt-COOH), Fe(3+), and natural polyphenols (Gossypol) to construct the nanoparticles (HA@PFG NPs) that have a stable structure, controllable drug release behavior, and high drug loading capacity. The acidic pH values in tumor sites facilitate the release of Fe(3+), Pt-COOH, and Gossypol from HA@PFG NPs. Pt-COOH with GSH consumption and cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus Gossypol with pro-apoptotic effects displays a synergistic effect for killing tumor cells. Furthermore, the release of Fe(3+) at the tumor sites promotes ferroptosis and enables MRI imaging of OC. In the patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model, HA@PFG NPs alleviate the tumor activity. RNA sequencing analysis reveals that HA@PFG NPs ameliorate OC symptoms mainly through IL-6 signal pathways. This work combines MRI imaging with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which holds great promise for OC diagnosis and synergistic therapy."
39287090,PTBP1 Regulates DNMT3B Alternative Splicing by Interacting With RALY to Enhance the Radioresistance of Prostate Cancer.,"Radiotherapy is a curative arsenal for prostate cancer (PCa), but radioresistance seriously compromises its effectiveness. Dysregulated RNA splicing factors are extensively involved in tumor progression. Nonetheless, the role of splicing factors in radioresistance remains largely unexplored in PCa. Here, 23 splicing factors that are differentially expressed between PCa and adjacent normal tissues across multiple public PCa databases are identified. Among those genes, polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is significantly upregulated in PCa and is positively associated with advanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that PTBP1 markedly reinforces genomic DNA stability to desensitize PCa cells to irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PTBP1 interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) associated with lethal yellow protein homolog (RALY) and regulates exon 5 splicing of DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3B) from DNMT3B-S to DNMT3B-L. Furthermore, upregulation of DNMT3B-L induces promoter methylation of dual-specificity phosphatase-2 (DUSP2) and subsequently inhibits DUSP2 expression, thereby increasing radioresistance in PCa. The findings highlight the role of splicing factors in inducing aberrant splicing events in response to radiotherapy and the potential role of PTBP1 and DNMT3B-L in reversing radioresistance in PCa."
39286979,BCL2 expression is enriched in advanced prostate cancer with features of lineage plasticity.,"The widespread use of potent androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) has led to an increasing emergence of AR-independent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), typically driven by loss of AR expression, lineage plasticity, and transformation to prostate cancers (PCs) that exhibit phenotypes of neuroendocrine or basal-like cells. The anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 is upregulated in neuroendocrine cancers and may be a therapeutic target for this aggressive PC disease subset. There is an unmet clinical need, therefore, to clinically characterize BCL2 expression in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), determine its association with AR expression, uncover its mechanisms of regulation, and evaluate BCL2 as a therapeutic target and/or biomarker with clinical utility. Here, using multiple PC biopsy cohorts and models, we demonstrate that BCL2 expression is enriched in AR-negative mCRPC, associating with shorter overall survival and resistance to ARSIs. Moreover, high BCL2 expression associates with lineage plasticity features and neuroendocrine marker positivity. We provide evidence that BCL2 expression is regulated by DNA methylation, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and increased by the neuronal transcription factor ASCL1. Finally, BCL2 inhibition had antitumor activity in some, but not all, BCL2-positive PC models, highlighting the need for combination strategies to enhance tumor cell apoptosis and enrich response."
39286388,Paired box proteins as diagnostic biomarkers for endocervical adenocarcinoma.,"In this editorial, we commented on the article by Akers et al published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Clinical Cases. We focused specifically on the role of the transcription factor paired box protein 8 (PAX8) belonging to the family PAX in the carcinogenesis of a gynecologic tumor, endocervical adenocarcinoma, arising from the tissue of mesonephric origin, and the potential diagnostic value for the same type of neoplasms. The global vaccination program of human papillomavirus (HPV) has dramatically reduced the incidence of cervical cancer, including cases of adenocarcinoma. The type of adenoid epithelial origin has a lower frequency of HPV detection but tends to be more aggressive and fatal. Cases of endocervical adenocarcinoma occurring in females of menopause age have been described in the 2023 volume of the World Journal of Clinical Cases and in our study recently published in Oncol Lett. The histopathological findings and immunohistochemical assays showed that the lesions had glandular morphology, and the specimens in these two reports were immunohistochemically positive for the transcription factor PAX8, albeit that they had opposing expression profiles of tumor suppressor p16 and estrogen receptor and the presence of the HPV genome. The presence of a mucin protein, MUC 5AC, as revealed in both studies suggested target molecules for the diagnosis of mucinous adenoid type of uterine tumor and other histological origins. The clinical outcome was unfavorable due to metastasis and recurrence. This prompted the improvement of the antitumor modality, with the introduction of precise targeting therapy. Mucin has now been reported to be the therapeutic target for adenocarcinomas."
39283774,Automatically Detecting Anchor Cells and Clustering for scRNA-Seq Data Using scTSNN.,"Advancing in single-cell RNA sequencing techniques enhances the resolution of cell heterogeneity study. Density-based unsupervised clustering has the potential to detect the representative anchor points and the number of clusters automatically. Meanwhile, discovering the true cell type of scRNA-seq data in the unsupervised scenario is still challenging. To this end, we proposed a tensor shared nearest neighbor anchor clustering for scRNA-seq data, named scTSNN, which first makes use of the tensor affinity learning module to mine the local-global balanced topological structures among cells, next designs density-based shared nearest neighbor measurement method to automatically detect anchor cells, finally partitions the non-anchor cells to obtain the clustering results. Validated on synthetic datasets and scRNA-seq datasets, scTSNN not only exactly detects the complicated structures but also has better performance in accuracy and robustness compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, case studies on mammalian cells and cervical cancer tumor cells demonstrate the selected anchor cells of scTSNN benefit the cell pseudotime inference and rare cell identification, which show good application and research value of scTSNN."
39283637,"West African Genetic Ancestry, Neighborhood Deprivation, and Prostate Cancer.","IMPORTANCE: Racial disparities in prostate cancer are likely the result of complex relationships between both socioeconomic and environmental factors captured by the neighborhood environment and genetic factors, including West African genetic ancestry. However, few studies have examined the combined role of neighborhood environment and genetic ancestry in developing lethal prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the interactions between West African genetic ancestry and neighborhood deprivation in modifying prostate cancer risk and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was conducted in the Greater Baltimore area. Participants included men of African and European descent (617 cases with prostate cancer, 852 controls without prostate cancer) enrolled between January 2005 and January 2016. Follow-up was performed through December 31, 2020, using the National Death Index. Analysis was conducted from August 2023 to January 2024. EXPOSURE: Included exposures were West African genetic ancestry, derived from large-scale genotyping, and neighborhood deprivation, defined using 2000 census-tract-level Neighborhood Deprivation Index (NDI) score. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes of interest were prostate cancer and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among a total of 1469 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.96 [7.95] years), there were 736 self-identified Black and 733 White men, and the mean (range) proportion of West African genetic ancestry was 0.27 (0.04-0.84) among participants residing in areas with low levels of deprivation and 0.48 (0.07-0.83) among participants residing in areas with high levels of deprivation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a significant multiplicative interaction of West African genetic ancestry and neighborhood deprivation with the odds of a prostate cancer diagnosis (P for interaction = .02). Among individuals living in neighborhoods with high NDI scores, West African genetic ancestry was associated with increased odds of a prostate cancer diagnosis (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.23-3.19). In contrast, West African genetic ancestry was associated with reduced odds of this diagnosis among individuals residing in areas with medium to low levels of deprivation (age-adjusted OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.44). There was no significant multiplicative interaction between West African genetic ancestry and neighborhood deprivation for all-cause mortality (P for interaction = .44). The positive association of neighborhood deprivation with prostate cancer was independent of West African genetic ancestry (age- and West African ancestry-adjusted OR, 1,70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.94). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case-control study of men with West African and European ancestry found that West African genetic ancestry was associated with increased odds of prostate cancer among males who resided in neighborhoods with high deprivation but lower odds in more affluent neighborhoods. Thus, neighborhood environments may play a critical role in defining how genetic ancestry modulates prostate cancer risk."
39281716,Establishing the homologous recombination score threshold in metastatic prostate cancer patients to predict the efficacy of PARP inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score serves as a promising biomarker to identify patients who are eligible for treatment with PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Previous studies have suggested a 3-biomarker Genomic Instability Score (GIS) threshold of >/= 42 as a valid biomarker to predict response to PARPi in patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer. However, the GIS threshold for prostate cancer (PCa) is still lacking. Here, we conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate an appropriate HRD score threshold and to evaluate its ability to predict response to PARPi in PCa patients. METHODS: A total of 181 patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa were included in this study. Tumor tissue specimens were collected for targeted next-generation sequencing for homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes and copy number variation (CNV) analysis. The HRD score was calculated based on over 50,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) distributed across the human genome, incorporating three SNP-based assays: loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transition. The HRD score threshold was set at the last 5th percentile of the HRD scores in our cohort of known HRR-deficient tumors. The relationship between the HRD score and the efficacy in 16 patients of our cohort who received PARPi treatment were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Genomic testing was succeeded in 162 patients. In our cohort, 61 patients (37.7%) had HRR mutations (HRRm). BRCA mutations occurred in 15 patients (9.3%). The median HRD score was 4 (ranged from 0 to 57) in the total cohort, which is much lower than that in breast and ovarian cancers. Patients who harbored HRRm and BRCA or TP53 mutations had higher HRD scores. CNV occured more frequently in patients with HRRm. The last 5th percentile of HRD scores was 43 in the HRR-mutant cohort and consequently HRD high was defined as HRD scores  >/=  43. In the 16 patients who received PARPi in our cohort, 4 patients with a high HRD score achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% while 12 patients with a low HRD score achieved an ORR of 8.3%. Progression-free survival (PFS) in HRD high patients was longer compared to HRD low patients, regardless of HRRm. CONCLUSIONS: A HRD score threshold of 43 was established and preliminarily validated to predict the efficacy of PARPi in this study. Future studies are needed to further verify this threshold."
39279246,Evaluating RB1 and p53 as diagnostic markers in treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer through immunohistochemistry and genomic analysis of RB1 and TP53.,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC) often involves a pathological assessment and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for neuroendocrine markers. Genomic alterations in RB1 and TP53 are frequently observed in NEPC and are believed to play a crucial role in the transformation of adenocarcinoma to NEPC. In this study, we examined the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of patients with t-NEPC to better understand their prognosis and diagnostic utility. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with t-NEPC at Kobe University Hospital between October 2018 and December 2022. Clinical data, including age, serum neuroendocrine marker levels, and treatment history, were collected. IHC was performed for conventional neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and CD56) and RB1 and p53 expression. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted using FoundationOne(R) CDx to identify mutations in RB1 and TP53. RESULTS: This study included 20 patients with t-NEPC. The median time from ADT initiation to development was 42.8 months. IHC revealed RB1 loss in 75% of cases and p53 abnormalities in 75% of cases. NGS identified RB1 mutations in 55% and TP53 mutations in 75% of cases. The concordance between NGS and IHC results was high, with 70% (14/20) agreement for RB1/RB1 and 80% (16/20) for p53/TP53. The immunostaining and genomic analysis of RB1/RB1 and p53/TP53 showed abnormal findings for the four negative cases for conventional neuroendocrine markers. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated high concordance between IHC and NGS findings for RB1/RB1 and p53/TP53 in t-NEPC. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of NGS performance compared with IHC, and these findings may help increase the diagnostic sensitivity of t-NEPC."
39279231,Diagnostic potential of SDHB mRNA contained in serum extracellular vesicles among patients with prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors(ARSIs) have been used to treat patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we aimed to identify novel serum extracellular vesicle (EV)-based biomarkers to diagnose ARSI-resistance and therapeutic targets for ARSI-resistant CRPC. METHODS: Total RNA contained in serum EVs from 5 cases of CRPC before ARSI treatment and after acquiring ARSI-resistance was subjected to RNA-sequencing. The expression changes of selected RNAs contained in EVs were confirmed in 48 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 107 PC using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and compared with tissue RNA expression using public datasets. RESULTS: RNA-sequencing revealed that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related genes were increased in EVs after acquiring ARSI-resistance. Among them, RT-qPCR and datasets analysis demonstrated that SDHB mRNA was upregulated after acquiring ARSI-resistance in EVs and ARSI-exposed PC tissue compared to ARSI-naive EVs and tissue, respectively. SDHB mRNA levels both in EVs and tissue were increased in localized PC compared with BPH and decreased in advanced PC. Tissue expression of SDHB mRNA was significantly correlated with those of other OXPHOS-related genes. SDHB mRNA in EVs (EV-SDHB) was elevated among 3 out of 7 ARSI-treating patients with stable PSA levels who later progressed to ARSI-resistant CRPC. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of OXPHOS-related mRNAs in EVs correlated with those in PC tissue, among which SDHB mRNA was found to be a novel biomarker to diagnose ARSI-resistance. EV-SDHB may be useful for early diagnosis of ARSI-resistance."
39277826,"Prognostic determinants in cancer survival: a multidimensional evaluation of clinical and genetic factors across 10 cancer types in the participants of Genomics England's 100,000 Genomes Project.","BACKGROUND: Cancer is a complex disease, caused and impacted by a combination of genetic, demographic, clinical, environmental and lifestyle factors. Analysis of cancer characteristics, risk factors, treatment options and the heterogeneity across cancer types has been the focus of medical research for years. The aim of this study is to describe and summarise genetic, clinicopathological, behavioural and demographic characteristics and their differences across ten common cancer types and evaluate their impact on overall survival outcomes. METHODS: This study included data from 9977 patients with bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, glioma, leukaemia, lung, ovarian, prostate, and renal cancers. Genetic data collected through the 100,000 Genomes Project was linked with clinical and demographic data provided by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS). Descriptive and Kaplan Meier survival analyses were performed to visualise similarities and differences across cancer types. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to identify statistically significant prognostic factor associations with overall survival. RESULTS: 161 clinical and 124 genetic factors were evaluated for prognostic association with overall survival. Of these, 116 unique factors were found to have significant prognostic effect for overall survival across ten cancer types when adjusted for age, sex and stage. The findings confirmed prognostic associations with overall survival identified in previous studies in factors such as multimorbidity, tumour mutational burden, and mutations in genes BRAF, CDH1, NF1, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53. The results also identified new prognostic associations with overall survival in factors such as mental health conditions, female health-related conditions, previous hospital encounters and mutations in genes FANCE, FBXW7, GATA3, MSH6, PTPN11, RB1, RNF43. CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive view of clinicopathological and genetic prognostic factors across different cancer types and draws attention to less commonly known factors which might help produce more precise prognosis and survival estimates. The results from this study contribute to the understanding of cancer disease and could be used by researchers to develop complex prognostic models, which in turn could help predict cancer prognosis more accurately and improve patient outcomes."
39276353,Integrative identification of non-coding regulatory regions driving metastatic prostate cancer.,"Large-scale sequencing efforts have been undertaken to understand the mutational landscape of the coding genome. However, the vast majority of variants occur within non-coding genomic regions. We designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Applying this framework to sequencing data from a large prostate cancer patient cohort revealed a large set of candidate drivers. We used (1) in silico analyses, (2) massively parallel reporter assays, and (3) in vivo CRISPR interference screens to systematically validate metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) drivers. One identified enhancer region, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of the U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. SF3A1 and CCDC157 promote tumor growth in vivo. We nominated a number of transcription factors, notably SOX6, to regulate expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157. Our integrative approach enables the systematic detection of non-coding regulatory regions that drive human cancers."
39276000,Drugs causing prostate-specific antigen changes: the food and drug administration adverse event reporting system combined with Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men worldwide, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is widely used for its early detection. Drug use may affect PSA levels, but the effect for most drugs is currently unknown. METHODS: This study first investigated drugs related to PSA changes through the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERs) database, and then used a Mendelian randomization (MR) method to explore the causal relationship between specific drugs and PSA changes using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. The statistical analysis software SAS and R were used in the study. RESULTS: Through analysis of the FAERs database, 22 drugs were found to be associated with an increase in PSA, and 14 drugs were associated with a decrease in PSA. MR analysis showed that the use of tamsulosin may lead to an increase in PSA. Heterogeneity test, horizontal pleiotropy test and leave-one-out Analysis verified the stability of the results. MR analyses for other drugs did not show statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This study provided a basis for better understanding the impact of medications on prostate health, helping to avoid overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of high-risk patients. However, research still requires larger-scale validation and in-depth exploration."
39275993,Current uses and resistance mechanisms of enzalutamide in prostate cancer treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality for men worldwide. Enzalutamide, a second-generation non-steroidal antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, is a treatment for biochemically recurrent, metastatic, castration-sensitive, and castration-resistant tumors. Unfortunately, most patients ultimately develop resistance to enzalutamide, making long-term treatment with this agent challenging. AREAS COVERED: We performed a literature search of PubMed without date restrictions to investigate the literature surrounding enzalutamide and discuss the current uses of enzalutamide, proposed mechanisms driving resistance, and summarize current efforts to mitigate this resistance. EXPERT OPINION: Enzalutamide is an effective prostate cancer therapy that is currently used in biochemically recurrent and metastatic disease and for both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant tumors. Unfortunately, resistance to enzalutamide occurs in each of these scenarios. In the clinical setting, enzalutamide-resistant tumors are either AR-driven or AR-indifferent. AR-dependent resistance mechanisms include genomic or epigenomic events that result in enhanced AR signaling. Tumors that do not require AR signaling instead may depend on alternative oncogenic pathways. There are numerous strategies to mitigate enzalutamide resistance, including concurrent use of PARP inhibitors or immune therapies. Additional work is required to uncover novel approaches to treat patients in the enzalutamide-resistant setting."
39273225,Prostate Cancer's Silent Partners: Fibroblasts and Their Influence on Glutamine Metabolism Manipulation.,"Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)s in the tumour microenvironment (TME) modulate the extracellular matrix, interact with cancer cells, and facilitate communication with infiltrating leukocytes, significantly contributing to cancer progression and therapeutic response. In prostate cancer (PCa), CAFs promote malignancy through metabolic rewiring, cancer stem cell regulation, and therapy resistance. Pre-clinical studies indicate that targeting amino acid metabolism, particularly glutamine (Gln) metabolism, reduces cancer proliferation and stemness. However, most studies lack the context of CAF-cancer interaction, focusing on monocultures. This study assesses the influence of CAFs on PCa growth by manipulating Gln metabolism using colour-labelled PCa cell lines (red) and fibroblast (green) in a co-culture system to evaluate CAFs' effects on PCa cell proliferation and clonogenic potential. CAFs increased the proliferation of hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells, whereas the castration-resistant C4-2 cells were unaffected. However, clonogenic growth increased in both cell lines. Gln deprivation and GLS1 inhibition experiments revealed that the increased growth rate of LNCAP cells was associated with increased dependence on Gln, which was confirmed by proteomic analyses. Tissue analysis of PCa patients revealed elevated GLS1 levels in both the PCa epithelium and stroma, suggesting that GLS1 is a therapeutic target. Moreover, the median overall survival analysis of GLS1 expression in the PCa epithelium and stroma identified a ""high-risk"" patient group that may benefit from GLS1-targeted therapies. Therefore, GLS1 targeting appears promising in castration-resistant PCa patients with high GLS1 epithelium and low GLS1 stromal expression."
39273194,"Targeting Androgen, Thyroid Hormone, and Vitamin A and D Receptors to Treat Prostate Cancer.","The nuclear hormone family of receptors regulates gene expression. The androgen receptor (AR), upon ligand binding and homodimerization, shuttles from the cytosol into the nucleus to activate gene expression. Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), retinoic acid receptors (RARs), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are present in the nucleus bound to chromatin as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and repress gene expression. Ligand binding leads to transcription activation. The hormonal ligands for these receptors play crucial roles to ensure the proper conduct of very many tissues and exert effects on prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Androgens support PCa proliferation and androgen deprivation alone or with chemotherapy is the standard therapy for PCa. RARgamma activation and 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) stimulation of TRbeta support the growth of PCa cells. Ligand stimulation of VDR drives growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis of PCa cells. Often these receptors are explored as separate avenues to find treatments for PCa and other cancers. However, there is accumulating evidence to support receptor interactions and crosstalk of regulatory events whereby a better understanding might lead to new combinatorial treatments."
39273065,The Tumor Suppressor Par-4 Regulates Adipogenesis by Transcriptional Repression of PPARgamma.,"Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4, also known as PAWR) is a ubiquitously expressed tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells, while leaving normal cells unaffected. Our previous studies indicated that genetic loss of Par-4 promoted hepatic steatosis, adiposity, and insulin-resistance in chow-fed mice. Moreover, low plasma levels of Par-4 are associated with obesity in human subjects. The mechanisms underlying obesity in rodents and humans are multi-faceted, and those associated with adipogenesis can be functionally resolved in cell cultures. We therefore used pluripotent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or preadipocyte cell lines responsive to adipocyte differentiation cues to determine the potential role of Par-4 in adipocytes. We report that pluripotent MEFs from Par-4(-/-) mice underwent rapid differentiation to mature adipocytes with an increase in lipid droplet accumulation relative to MEFs from Par-4(+/+) mice. Knockdown of Par-4 in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cultures by RNA-interference induced rapid differentiation to mature adipocytes. Interestingly, basal expression of PPARgamma, a master regulator of de novo lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, was induced during adipogenesis in the cell lines, and PPARgamma induction and adipogenesis caused by Par-4 loss was reversed by replenishment of Par-4. Mechanistically, Par-4 downregulates PPARgamma expression by directly binding to its upstream promoter, as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase-reporter studies. Thus, Par-4 transcriptionally suppresses the PPARgamma promoter to regulate adipogenesis."
39273054,HOTAIR Promotes the Hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathways via PTEN Hypermethylation in Cervical Cancer.,"The mechanisms underlying the sustained activation of the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways mediated by HOTAIR in cervical cancer (CC) have not been extensively described. To address this knowledge gap in the literature, we explored the interactions between these pathways by driving HOTAIR expression levels in HeLa cells. Our findings reveal that HOTAIR is a key regulator in sustaining the activation of both signaling pathways. Specifically, altering HOTAIR expression-either by knockdown or overexpression-significantly influenced the transcriptional activity of the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Additionally, we discovered that HIF1alpha directly induces HOTAIR transcription, which in turn leads to the epigenetic silencing of the PTEN promoter via DNMT1. This process leads to the sustained activation of both pathways, highlighting a novel regulatory axis involving HOTAIR and HIF1alpha in cervical cancer. Our results suggest a new model in which HOTAIR sustains reciprocal activation of the PI3K/AKT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways through the HOTAIR/HIF1alpha axis, thereby contributing to the oncogenic phenotype of cervical cancer."
39272811,Sialylation Inhibition Can Partially Revert Acquired Resistance to Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Prostate cancer is a lethal solid malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. Treatments, including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy, are available and have improved patient survival; however, recurrence remains a huge clinical challenge. Enzalutamide is a second-generation androgen receptor antagonist that is used to treat castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Among patients who initially respond to enzalutamide, virtually all acquire secondary resistance, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms involved is urgently needed. Aberrant glycosylation, and, in particular, alterations to sialylated glycans, have been reported as mediators of therapy resistance in cancer, but a link between tumour-associated glycans and resistance to therapy in prostate cancer has not yet been investigated. Here, using cell line models, we show that prostate cancer cells with acquired resistance to enzalutamide therapy have an upregulation of the sialyltransferase ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) and increased levels of alpha2,6-sialylated N-glycans. Furthermore, using the sialyltransferase inhibitor P-SiaFNEtoc, we discover that acquired resistance to enzalutamide can be partially reversed by combining enzalutamide therapy with sialic acid blockade. Our findings identify a potential role for ST6GAL1-mediated aberrant sialylation in acquired resistance to enzalutamide therapy for prostate cancer and suggest that sialic acid blockade in combination with enzalutamide may represent a novel therapeutic approach in patients with advanced disease. Our study also highlights the potential to bridge the fields of cancer biology and glycobiology to develop novel combination therapies for prostate cancer."
39271294,Long-read DNA and cDNA sequencing identify cancer-predisposing deep intronic variation in tumor-suppressor genes.,"The vast majority of deeply intronic genomic variants are benign, but some extremely rare or private deep intronic variants lead to exonification of intronic sequence with abnormal transcriptional consequences. Damaging variants of this class are likely underreported as causes of disease for several reasons: Most clinical DNA and RNA testing does not include full intronic sequences; many of these variants lie in complex repetitive regions that cannot be aligned from short-read whole-genome sequence; and, until recently, consequences of deep intronic variants were not accurately predicted by in silico tools. We evaluated the frequency and consequences of rare deep intronic variants for families severely affected with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and/or metastatic prostate cancer, but with no causal variant identified by any previous genomic or cDNA-based approach. For 10 tumor-suppressor genes, we used multiplexed adaptive sampling long-read DNA sequencing and cDNA sequencing, based on patient-derived DNA and RNA, to systematically evaluate deep intronic variation. We identified all variants across the full genomic loci of targeted genes, applied the in silico tools SpliceAI and Pangolin to predict variants of functional consequence, and then carried out long-read cDNA sequencing to identify aberrant transcripts. For eight of the 120 (6%) previously unsolved families, rare deep intronic variants in BRCA1, PALB2, and ATM create intronic pseudoexons that are spliced into transcripts, leading to premature truncations. These results suggest that long-read DNA and cDNA sequencing can be integrated into variant discovery, with strategies for accurately characterizing pathogenic variants."
39270619,Fatigue Management in Advanced Prostate Cancer: Real-World Insights From Qualitative Interviews With Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC) commonly experience fatigue related to the disease itself and its treatment, which affects their quality of life. There are limited real-world data available on patients' experiences of fatigue while receiving PC treatment and its management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, noninterventional qualitative study involving individual concept-elicitation interviews with patients in the United States. Patients with advanced PC aged >/=18 years who had experienced fatigue and were on androgen-deprivation therapy in combination with second-generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitors were interviewed and their experiences quantified. RESULTS: Of the 143 patients screened, 13 qualified and 11 completed the interview. Most patients used the term ""fatigue"" (n = 8) to describe their experiences of tiredness, exhaustion, lack of energy, and weakness. Most patients (n = 8) did not receive any form of educational support from their healthcare providers (HCPs), but some expressed an interest in receiving this support (pamphlets, n = 4; discussion with HCPs, n = 4; online resources, n = 3). Most patients (n = 9) self-discovered fatigue-management strategies over the course of their disease and treatment. Patients found that rigorous exercise (n = 5), regular naps (n = 2), increased rest (n = 3), and a healthy diet (n = 3) were the most effective approaches for managing their fatigue. CONCLUSION: Tools are needed to support HCPs with counseling patients with PC for effective management of disease- and treatment-related fatigue."
39269996,Plasma ctDNA as a Treatment Response Biomarker in Metastatic Cancers: Evaluation by the RECIST Working Group.,"Early indicators of metastatic cancer response to therapy are important for evaluating new drugs and stopping ineffective treatment. The RECIST guidelines based on repeat cancer imaging are widely adopted in clinical trials, are used to identify active regimens that may change practice, and contribute to regulatory approvals. However, these criteria do not provide insight before 6 to 12 weeks of treatment and typically require that patients have measurable disease. Recent data suggest that measuring on-treatment changes in the amount or proportion of ctDNA in peripheral blood plasma may accurately identify responding and nonresponding cancers at earlier time points. Over the past year, the RECIST working group has evaluated current evidence for plasma ctDNA kinetics as a treatment response biomarker in metastatic cancers and early endpoint in clinical trials to identify areas of focus for future research and validation. Here, we outline the requirement for large standardized trial datasets, greater scrutiny of optimal ctDNA collection time points and assay thresholds, and consideration of regulatory body guidelines and patient opinions. In particular, clinically meaningful changes in plasma ctDNA abundance are likely to differ by cancer type and therapy class and must be assessed before ctDNA can be considered a potential pan-cancer response evaluation biomarker. Despite the need for additional data, minimally invasive on-treatment ctDNA measurements hold promise to build upon existing response assessments such as RECIST and offer opportunities for developing novel early endpoints for modern clinical trials."
39269310,Androgen Deprivation Therapy Drives a Distinct Immune Phenotype in Localized Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the backbone of prostate cancer treatment. Beyond the suppression of testosterone and tumor cell growth, emerging evidence suggests that ADT also modulates the immune tumor microenvironment. However, a more precise understanding of the timing and intricacies of these immunologic shifts is needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we analyzed 49 primary prostate cancers, comparing those surgically removed either without treatment or following treatment with degarelix at 4, 7, and 14 days before surgery. Utilizing next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing and multiplexed immunofluorescence, we examined alterations in immune phenotypes in the presence or absence of ADT. RESULTS: Our findings reveal that ADT rapidly transforms the typically bland prostate tumor microenvironment into an inflamed environment within days. Notably, we observed an increase in activated CD8 T cells along with an increase in suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg). We also found an expansion of the myeloid compartment, particularly proinflammatory M1-like tumor-associated macrophages. Intriguingly, discernable changes which have not previously been described also occurred in tumor cells, including upregulation of antigen presentation by MHC classes I and II and, unexpectedly, a decrease in the ""do not eat me"" signal CD47. CONCLUSIONS: These observations underscore the critical role of timing and disease context in order to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of immune modulators combined with androgen ablation, for which the presurgical neoadjuvant setting may be ideal. Our findings warrant future prospective validation, which is currently underway."
39268161,Construction of a cuproptosis‑related lncRNA signature to predict biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.,"Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is common in prostate cancer (PCa), and patients with BCR usually have a poor prognosis. Cuproptosis is a unique type of cell death, and copper homeostasis is crucial to the occurrence and development of malignancies. The present study aimed to explore the prognostic value of cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs; CRLs) in PCa and to develop a predictive signature for forecasting BCR in patients with PCa. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas database, transcriptomic, mutation and clinical data were collected from patients with PCa. A total of 121 CRLs were identified using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Subsequently, a 6-CRL signature consisting of AC087276.2, CNNM3-DT, AC090198.1, AC138207.5, METTL14-DT and LINC01515 was created to predict the BCR of patients with PCa through Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that high-risk patients had a low BCR-free survival rate. In addition, there was a substantial difference between the high- and low-risk groups in the immune microenvironment, immune therapy, drug sensitivity and tumor mutational burden. A nomogram integrating the Gleason score, 6-CRL signature and clinical T-stage was established and evaluated. Finally, the expression of signature lncRNAs in PCa cells was verified through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. In conclusion, the 6-CRL signature may be a potential tool for making predictions regarding BCR in patients with PCa, and the prognostic nomogram may be considered a practical tool for clinical decision-making."
39268158,Changes in the molecular nodes of the Notch and NRF2 pathways in cervical cancer tissues from the precursor stages to invasive carcinoma.,"Cancer is a multifactorial disease characterized by the loss of control in the expression of genes known as cancer driver genes. Cancer driver genes trigger uncontrolled cell replication, which leads to the development of malignant tumors. A cluster of signal transduction pathways that contain cancer driver genes involved in cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and dysregulated organ growth, are associated with cancer initiation and progression. In the present study, three signal transduction pathways involved in cervical cancer (CC) development were analyzed: The Hippo pathway (FAT atypical cadherin, yes-associated protein 1, SMAD4 and TEA domain family member 2), the Notch pathway [cellular-MYC, cAMP response element-binding binding protein (CREBBP), E1A-associated cellular p300 transcriptional co-activator protein and F-Box and WD repeat domain containing 7] and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway [NRF2, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), AKT and PIK3-catalytic subunit alpha]. Tumor samples from patients diagnosed with various stages of CC, including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, in situ CC and invasive CC, were analyzed. The mRNA expression levels were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assays, whereas protein expression levels were assessed through immunohistochemical tissue microarrays. High mRNA expression levels of c-MYC and AKT and low expression levels of NRF2 and KEAP1 were associated with a decreased survival time of patients with CC. Additionally, increased expression levels of c-MYC were detected in the invasive CC stage. At the protein level, increased NRF2 expression levels were observed in all five stages of CC samples compared with those in the cancer-free control samples. AKT1 was found to be dysregulated in the CIN 1 and CIN 2 stages, PI3K in the in situ and invasive stages, and CREBBP in the CIN 3 and in situ stages. In summary, the present study demonstrated significant changes in proteins of the Notch and NRF2 pathways in CC. NRF2 was overexpressed in all cervical cancer stages (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, in situ CC and invasive CC). The present study makes an important contribution to the possible biomarker proteins to be analyzed for the presence of premalignant and malignant lesions in the cervix."
39267848,Exploration of the causal relationship between inflammatory cytokines and prostate carcinoma: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting males; however, the role of inflammatory activity in the pathogenesis of this disease is not yet fully elucidated. Although inflammation is recognized as being closely associated with the onset and progression of PCa, the specific causal relationships between individual inflammatory factors and the disease require further clarification. METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) methodologies can mitigate bias by utilizing whole-genome sequencing data, leveraging specific genetic variants to assess causal relationships between a given exposure and an outcome of interest. This research employed an MR approach to investigate the association between inflammatory cytokines and PCa. RESULTS: In total, 44 inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in a large GWAS dataset to enable the drawing of robust conclusions. Elevated circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) levels were related to greater PCa risk. The reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) study indicates a causal relationship between prostate cancer and stem cell factor (SCF) (P=0.025). CONCLUSION: CRP and PGE-2 play crucial roles in the regulation of PCa development. Moreover, PCa may have an impact on SCF levels. Further research is imperative to elucidate whether these biomarkers can be effectively utilized to prevent or treat PCa."
39267686,Exosomal miR-664a-5p as a therapeutic target biomarker for PARP inhibitor response in prostate cancer.,"This study investigated the role of urinary exosomal miR-664a-5p as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa). Small RNA sequencing of urinary exosomes from PCa patients with different responses to PARP inhibitors revealed that miR-664a-5p was significantly upregulated in responsive patients. Overexpression of miR-664a-5p enhanced the sensitivity of PCa cells to PARP inhibitors by directly targeting FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in DNA damage repair, leading to the downregulation of DNA damage response genes. Combined treatment with miR-664a-5p and olaparib synergistically inhibited tumor growth in a PC-3 xenograft mouse model. These findings suggest that urinary exosomal miR-664a-5p is a potential therapeutic biomarker for PARP inhibitor response in PCa patients, and targeting FOXM1 via miR-664a-5p represents a promising strategy for enhancing PARP inhibitor efficacy in PCa treatment."
39266679,"AR coactivators, CBP/p300, are critical mediators of DNA repair in prostate cancer.","Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease stage with ineffective treatments options. Here, the androgen receptor (AR) coactivators CBP/p300, which are histone acetyltransferases, were identified as critical mediators of DNA damage repair (DDR) to potentially enhance therapeutic targeting of CRPC. Key findings demonstrate that CBP/p300 expression increases with disease progression and selects for poor prognosis in metastatic disease. CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition enhances response to standard of care therapeutics. Functional studies, CBP/p300 cistrome mapping, and transcriptome in CRPC revealed that CBP/p300 regulates DDR. Further mechanistic investigation showed that CBP/p300 attenuation via therapeutic targeting and genomic knockdown decreases homologous recombination (HR) factors in vitro, in vivo, and in human prostate cancer (PCa) tumors ex vivo. Similarly, CBP/p300 expression in human prostate tissue correlates with HR factors. Lastly, targeting CBP/p300 impacts HR-mediate repair and patient outcome. Collectively, these studies identify CBP/p300 as drivers of PCa tumorigenesis and lay the groundwork to optimize therapeutic strategies for advanced PCa via CBP/p300 inhibition, potentially in combination with AR-directed and DDR therapies."
39266536,Somatic mutations in 3929 HPV positive cervical cells associated with infection outcome and HPV type.,"Invasive cervical cancers (ICC), caused by HPV infections, have a heterogeneous molecular landscape. We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6 years prior to cancer diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using exfoliated cervical cells for detection of somatic mutations as potential diagnostic biomarkers."

39265728,Proangiogenic potential of plasma exosomes from prostate cancer patients.,"Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in the progression and metastasis of solid cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). While small extracellular vesicles derived from PCa cell lines induce a proangiogenic phenotype in vascular endothelial cells, the contribution of plasma exosomes from patients with PCa to this process remains unclear. Here, we successfully extracted and characterized plasma exosomes. Notably, a ring of PKH67-labeled exosomes was observed around the HUVEC nucleus using fluorescence microscopy, indicating the uptake of exosomes by HUVEC. At the cellular level, PCa plasma exosomes enhanced angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and migration of HUVEC cells. Moreover, PCa plasma exosomes promoted angiogenesis and aortic sprouting. MicroRNAs are the most common genetic material in exosomes, and to identify miRNAs associated with the angiogenic response, we performed small RNA sequencing followed by RT-qPCR and bioinformatics analysis. These analyses revealed distinct miRNA profiles in plasma exosomes from patients with PCa compared to healthy individuals. Notably, hsa-miR-184 emerged as a potential regulator implicated in the proangiogenic effects of PCa plasma exosomes."
39265423,Metabolomics and proteomics reveal the inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus crispatus on cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant global health issue due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Recently, Lactobacillus crispatus has been recognized for its crucial role in maintaining cervical health. While some studies have explored the use of L. crispatus to mitigate cervical cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we employed non-targeted proteomics and metabolomics to investigate how L. crispatus affects the growth of cervical cancer cells (SiHa) and normal cervical cells (Ect1/E6E7). Our findings indicated that the inhibitory effect of L. crispatus on SiHa cells was associated with various biological processes, notably the ferroptosis pathway. Specifically, L. crispatus was found to regulate the expression of proteins such as HMOX1, SLC39A14, VDAC2, ACSL4, and LPCAT3 by SiHa cells, which are closely related to ferroptosis. Additionally, it activated the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in SiHa cells, leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides (LPO). These results revealed the therapeutic potential of L. crispatus in targeting the ferroptosis pathway for cervical cancer treatment, opening new avenues for research and therapy in cervical cancer."
39265356,The Prominence of the Broad-Spectrum Protease inhibitor gene A2ML1 as a potential biomarker in cervical cancer diagnostics using Immunotherapeutic and Multi-Omics approaches.,"One of the venereal tumors that threaten human life is cervical cancer. A2ML1 is detected in advanced-stage cancer patients and is found to be strongly associated with cervical cancer. A2ML1 was shown to be substantially expressed in cervical cancer in this study, which used data from the TCGA database. Those with high A2ML1 expression had a lower chance of survival than patients with low A2ML1 expression. Both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were utilized to investigate the relationship between clinical variables and overall survival rates. An investigation into the link between A2ML1 and immune infiltration was subsequently conducted. Utilizing the immune cell database, research was conducted to investigate the dispersion of 24 immune cells and their correlation to A2ML1 expression. In addition to this, the favorable correlation between immune cells and A2ML1 was validated using all three immune cell methodologies. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database was used to confirm the idea that there is a link between A2ML1 expression and the efficacy of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The findings demonstrated that A2ML1 is a potential biomarker for cervical cancer diagnostics. This biomarker may be used to chaperone immunotherapy, as well as to explain the elucidates of cervical cancer caused by the immunological microenvironment."
39264467,Identifying hub genes for chemo-radiotherapy sensitivity in cervical cancer: a bi-dataset in silico analysis.,"PURPOSE: To identify the hub genes that associated with chemo-radiotherapy sensitivity for cervical cancer and to explore the relationship between hub genes and various cellular processes and potential mechanism of cervical cancer. METHODS: The gene expression data of 21 patients with CESC and the mRNA expression profiles of 296 patients with CESC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, respectively. The potential functions and regulatory mechanisms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Hub genes were identified using random survival forest analysis. The relationship between hub genes and various cellular processes was comprehensively analyzed. The expression of hub genes was assessed using clinical data extracted from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. RESULTS: A total of 139 and 13 DEGs were found to be upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in CESC. The six hub genes, namely, SELP, PIM2, CCL19, SDS, NRP1, and SF3A2, were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, chemotherapy sensitivity, disease-related genes, and enriched signaling pathways (all p-value < 0.05). A nomogram and calibration curve were generated using the six hub genes to predict prognosis with high accuracy. A regulatory network comprising TFs (ZBTB3) and mRNAs (NRP1/PIM2/SELP) and several competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks comprising mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs were constructed. Data from HPA indicated that the protein expression of the six hub genes differed significantly between patients with CESC and healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: Upregulation of SELP, PIM2, CCL19, SDS, NRP1, and SF3A2 is associated with radiotherapy sensitivity and is involved in various cellular processes in CESC. These six genes may serve as biomarkers for predicting the radiotherapy response and prognosis in patients with CESC."
39263148,Methylation-related differentially expressed genes as potential prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer.,"AIM: To discover novel methylation-related differentially expressed genes (MRDEGs) for cervical cancer, with a focus on their potential for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. MATERIALS & METHODS: We integrated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. TCGA-MRDEGs were identified by analyzing differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and their correlation with gene expression. We examined GEO datasets GSE39001, GSE9750, and GSE46306 for GEO-MRDEGs. Overlapping MRDEGs were subjected to overall survival (OS) analysis to identify prognostic markers. The expression and methylation levels of these genes were validated in a total of 30 tissue samples, comprising 20 from cervical cancer patients and 10 from normal cervical tissues, using qRT-PCR and MassARRAY EpiTYPER Assay. RESULTS: A total of 314 TCGA-MRDEGs and 40 GEO-MRDEGs were identified. Intersection analysis yielded 10 overlapping MRDEGs. Notably, NOVA1, GSTM5, TRHDE, and CXCL12 were found to have reduced expression and increased methylation in cervical cancer, which correlated with poor prognosis. The methylation status and expression levels of these genes were confirmed in tissue specimens. CONCLUSION: We identified four MRDEGs as potential prognostic biomarkers for cervical cancer. Their clinical utility is highlighted, but further validation in larger cohorts is required to establish their clinical significance."
39263087,Pan-cancer exploration of PNO1: A prospective prognostic biomarker with ties to immune infiltration.,"The partner of NOB1 homolog (PNO1) is an RNA-binding protein that participates in ribosome biogenesis and protein modification. The functions of this molecule are largely unknown in cancers, particularly breast cancer. We employed bioinformatics methods to probe the putative oncogenic functions of PNO1 based on expression profiles and clinical data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), genotype-tissue expression project (GTEx), human protein atlas (HPA), cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), UALCAN, drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC) and UCSC XENA databases. Our analyses revealed that PNO1 was overexpressed in 31 malignancies, which excluded kidney chromophobe (KICH) and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML). Prognostic assessments have demonstrated that high PNO1 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall and disease-specific survival in various cancers. The promoter methylation level of PNO1 is significantly decreased in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Furthermore, inhibition of PNO1 decreased the viability, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, and these results were confirmed by mouse xenograft models of breast cancer. In addition, we discovered that tumor microenvironment (TME), immune infiltration, and chemotherapy sensitivity were influenced by PNO1 expression. Concordantly, our analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between PNO1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression across breast carcinoma samples. In conclusion, these findings indicate that PNO1 could act as a promising prognostic biomarker and adjunct diagnostic indicator, because it affects tumor growth and invasion. Our study offers valuable new perspectives on the oncogenic role of PNO1 in various types of cancers."
39262965,Enhancing outcome prediction of concurrent chemoradiation treatment in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer through plasma extracellular vesicle proteomics.,"Most patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are primarily treated using concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT); however, LACC lacks reliable predictive biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) could define the dynamic biological response to CCRT. However, the relationship between EVs and the therapeutic response to LACC is unestablished. Thus, we aimed to determine the relationship of plasma EVs pre- and post-CCRT in 62 patients with LACC. For proteomic analyses, EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation (UC) with size exclusion chromatography or UC alone. We found that plasma particle concentration was significantly increased post-treatment in non-responders. After CCRT, there was a decrease in proteins related to serine protease and fibrinogen, which contribute to tumor microenvironment alteration. This reduction also extended to proteins involved in innate immune and viral immune responses, correlating with reduced tumor burden. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis revealed 8, 13, and 19 proteins at diagnosis, one month, and three months, respectively, influencing the CCRT response. Among these, FIBG, TFR1, HBA, and FINC are prognostic markers according to The Cancer Genome Atlas tissue gene expression database. Our discriminant model demonstrated excellent specificity and negative predictive value, underscoring the model's reliability in determining responsiveness to CCRT and highlighting the potential clinical applicability of EVs in improving outcomes in LACC."
39262475,Upregulation of CKS2 in immunosuppressive cells is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in prostate cancer: a single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis worsens prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis, with the immunosuppressive microenvironment playing a key role in bone metastasis. This study aimed to investigate how an immunosuppressive environment promotes PCa metastasis and worsens prognosis of patients with PCa. METHODS: Candidate oncogenes were identified through analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A prognostic model was developed for the purpose of identifying target genes. A single-cell RNA sequencing data from GEO database was used to analyze the localization of target genes in the tumor microenvironment. A pan-cancer analysis was conducted to study the cancer-causing potential of target genes across different types of tumors. RESULTS: Fifty-one genes were found to be differentially expressed in bone metastasis compared to non-metastatic PCa, with CKS2 identified as the most significant gene associated with poor prognosis. CKS2 was shown to be linked to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and osteoclastic bone metastases, as shown by its negative correlation with immune cell infiltration and osteoblast-related gene expression. Moreover, CKS2 was found in immunosuppressive cells and was linked to bone metastasis in PCa. It was also overexpressed in different types of tumors, making it as an oncogenic gene. CONCLUSIONS: This research offers a new perspective on the potential utility of CKS2 as a therapeutic target for the prevention of metastatic PCa."
39261819,"SQLE-a promising prognostic biomarker in cervical cancer: implications for tumor malignant behavior, cholesterol synthesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and immune infiltration.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, encompassing squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), presents a considerable risk to the well-being of women. Recent studies have reported that squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is overexpressed in several cancers, which contributes to cancer development. METHODS: RNA sequencing data for SQLE were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In vitro experiments, including colorimetry, colony formation, Transwell, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, a transplanted CESC nude mouse model was constructed to validate the tumorigenic activity of SQLE in vivo. Associations among the SQLE expression profiles, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), immune infiltration, and chemosensitivity were examined. The prognostic value of genetic changes and DNA methylation in SQLE were also assessed. RESULTS: SQLE mRNA expression was significantly increased in CESC. ROC analysis revealed the strong diagnostic ability of SQLE toward CESC. Patients with high SQLE expression experienced shorter overall survival. The promotional effects of SQLE on cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, cholesterol synthesis, and EMT were emphasized. DEGs functional enrichment analysis revealed the signaling pathways and biological processes. Notably, a connection existed between the SQLE expression and the presence of immune cells as well as the activation of immune checkpoints. Increased SQLE expressions exhibited increased chemotherapeutic responses. SQLE methylation status was significantly associated with CESC prognosis. CONCLUSION: SQLE significantly affects CESC prognosis, malignant behavior, cholesterol synthesis, EMT, and immune infiltration; thereby offering diagnostic and indicator roles in CESC. Thus, SQLE can be a novel therapeutic target in CESC treatment."
39258426,Targeting the CLK2/SRSF9 splicing axis in prostate cancer leads to decreased ARV7 expression.,"In advanced prostate cancer (PC), in particular after acquisition of resistance to androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSI), upregulation of AR splice variants compromises endocrine therapy efficiency. Androgen receptor splice variant-7 (ARV7) is clinically the most relevant and has a distinct 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) compared to the AR full-length variant, suggesting a unique post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we set out to evaluate the applicability of the ARV7 3'UTR as a therapy target. A common single nucleotide polymorphism, rs5918762, was found to affect the splicing rate and thus the expression of ARV7 in cellular models and patient specimens. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 9 (SRSF9) was found to bind to and increase the inclusion of the cryptic exon 3 of ARV7 during the splicing process in the alternative C allele of rs5918762. The dual specificity protein kinase CLK2 interferes with the activity of SRSF9 by regulating its expression. Inhibition of the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK) family by the small molecules cirtuvivint or lorecivivint results in the decreased expression of ARV7. Both inhibitors show potent anti-proliferative effects in enzalutamide-treated or -naive PC models. Thus, targeting aberrant alternative splicing at the 3'UTR of ARV7 by disturbing the CLK2/SRSF9 axis might be a valuable therapeutic approach in late stage, ARSI-resistant PC."
39257456,Homologous Recombination Repair Testing Patterns and Outcomes in mCRPC by Alteration Status and Race.,"BACKGROUND: Alterations in DNA damage repair genes in advanced prostate cancer (PC) may impact responses to therapy and clinical outcomes. This study described homologous recombination repair (HRR) testing patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by HRR alteration status and race in the United States (US). METHODS: Clinical data in the nationwide (US-based) Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI) Metastatic PC Clinico-Genomic Database were evaluated (01/01/2011-12/31/2022). Patients initiating first-line (1L) mCRPC therapy on or after mCRPC diagnosis were included. Testing patterns, time-to-next treatment, overall survival (OS), and time-to-prostate specific antigen response were described. RESULTS: Of the 1367 patients with mCRPC and at least one HRR panel test prior to or on the date of 1L mCRPC therapy initiation, 332 (24.3%) were HRR positive (White patients: n = 219 [66.0%]; Black patients: n = 37 [11.1%]) and 1035 (75.7%) were HRR negative (White patients: n = 702 [67.8%]; Black patients: n = 84 [8.1%]). The mean time between first positive test and 1L mCRPC therapy initiation date was 588 days (White patients: 589 days; Black patients: 639 days). Among HRR positive relative to negative patients, trends for faster progression (respective 12-month rate overall: 71.1% and 63.7%; White patients: 72.5% and 64.0%; Black patients: 65.4% and 56.4%), shorter OS (respective 24-month rate overall: 46.8% and 51.9%; White patients: 48.6% and 46.2%; Black patients: 52.8% and 54.1%), and decreased treatment response (respective 12-month rate overall: 24.3% and 37.9%; White patients: 24.5% and 35.2%; Black patients: 17.0% and 43.9%) were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with mCRPC positive for HRR alterations tended to exhibit poorer treatment responses and clinical outcomes than those with a negative status. These findings highlight the importance of timely genetic testing in mCRPC, particularly among Black patients, and the need for improved 1L targeted therapies to address the unmet need in HRR positive mCRPC."
39256886,Human intermediate prostate cancer stem cells contribute to the initiation and development of prostate adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Intermediate cells are present in the early stages of human prostate development and adenocarcinoma. While primary cells isolated from benign human prostate tissues or tumors exhibit an intermediate phenotype in vitro, they cannot form tumors in vivo unless genetically modified. It is unclear about the stem cell properties and tumorigenicity of intermediate cells. METHODS: We developed a customized medium to culture primary human intermediate prostate cells, which were transplanted into male immunodeficient NCG mice to examine tumorigenicity in vivo. We treated the cells with different concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and enzalutamide in vitro and surgically castrated the mice after cell transplantation in vivo. Immunostaining, qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, and western blotting were performed to characterize the cells in tissues and 2D and 3D cultures. RESULTS: We found intermediate cells expressing AR(+)PSA(+)CK8(+)CK5(+) in the luminal compartment of human prostate adenocarcinoma by immunostaining. We cultured the primary intermediate cells in vitro, which expressed luminal (AR(+)PSA(+)CK8(+)CK18(+)), basal (CK5(+)P63(+)), intermediate (IVL(+)), and stem cell (CK4(+)CK13(+)PSCA(+)SOX2(+)) markers. These cells resisted castration in vitro by upregulating the expression of AR, PSA, and proliferation markers KI67 and PCNA. The intermediate cells had high tumorigenicity in vivo, forming tumors in immunodeficient NCG mice in a month without any genetic modification or co-transplantation with embryonic urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGSM) cells. We named these cells human castration-resistant intermediate prostate cancer stem cells or CriPCSCs and defined the xenograft model as patient primary cell-derived xenograft (PrDX). Human CriPCSCs resisted castration in vitro and in vivo by upregulating AR expression. Furthermore, human CriPCSCs differentiated into amplifying adenocarcinoma cells of luminal phenotype in PrDX tumors in vivo, which can dedifferentiate into CriPCSCs in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified and established methods for culturing human CriPCSCs, which had high tumorigenicity in vivo without any genetic modification or UGSM co-transplantation. Human CriPCSCs differentiated into amplifying adenocarcinoma cells of luminal phenotype in the fast-growing tumors in vivo, which hold the potential to dedifferentiate into intermediate stem cells. These cells resisted castration by upregulating AR expression. The human CriPCSC and PrDX methods hold significant potential for advancing prostate cancer research and precision medicine."
39256850,Fgf9 promotes incisor dental epithelial stem cell survival and enamel formation.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of cytokines in tooth development is critical for advancing dental tissue engineering. Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) is the only FGF consistently expressed throughout dental epithelial tissue, from the initiation of tooth bud formation to tooth maturation. However, mice lacking Fgf9 (Fgf9(-/-)) surprisingly show no obvious abnormalities in tooth development, suggesting potential compensation by other FGFs. Here we report findings from an Fgf9(S99N) mutation mouse model, a loss-of-function mutation with a dominant negative effect. Our study reveals that Fgf9 is crucial for dental epithelial stem cell (DESC) survival and enamel formation. METHODS: To dissect the role of Fgf9 in tooth development, we performed the micro-CT, histomorphological analysis and gene expression assay in mice and embryos with S99N mutation. In addition, we assessed the effect of FGF9 on the DESC survival and dental epithelial differentiation by DESC sphere formation assay and tooth explant culture. Cell/tissue culture methods, gene expression analysis, specific inhibitors, and antibody blockage analysis were employed to explore how Fgf9 regulates enamel differentiation and DESC survival through both direct and indirect mechanisms. RESULTS: The Fgf9(S99N) mutation in mice led to reduced ameloblasts, impaired enamel formation, and increased apoptosis in the cervical loop (CL). DESC sphere culture experiments revealed that FGF9 facilitated DESC survival via activating ERK/CREB signaling, without affecting cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vitro tissue culture experiments demonstrated that FGF9 promoted enamel formation in a manner dependent on the presence of mesenchyme. Interestingly, FGF9 stimulation inhibited enamel formation in isolated enamel epithelia and DESC spheres. Further investigation revealed that FGF9 supports DESC survival and promotes amelogenesis by stimulating the secretion of FGF3 and FGF10 in dental mesenchymal cells via the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that Fgf9 is essential for DESC survival and enamel formation. Fgf9 performs as a dual-directional regulator of the dental enamel epithelium, not only inhibiting DESC differentiation into ameloblasts to preserve the stemness of DESC, but also promoting ameloblast differentiation through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions."
39256447,Prevalence of germline variants in Brazilian pancreatic carcinoma patients.,"We evaluated the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants (PGV) in Brazilian pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) patients, that represent a multiethnic population, in a cross-sectional study. We included 192 PC patients unselected for family history of cancer. We evaluated a panel of 113 cancer genes, through genomic DNA sequencing and 46 ancestry-informative markers, through multiplex PCR. The median age was 61 years; 63.5% of the patients presented disease clinical stages III or IV; 8.3% reported personal history of cancer; 4.7% and 16.1% reported first-degree relatives with PC or breast and/or prostate cancer, respectively. Although the main ancestry was European, there was considerable genetic composition admixture. Twelve patients (6.25%) were PGV carriers in PC predisposition genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, MSH2, PALB2) and another 25 (13.0%) were PGV carriers in genes with a limited association or not previously associated with PC (ACD, BLM, BRIP1, CHEK2, ERCC4, FANCA, FANCE, FANCM, GALNT12, MITF, MRE11, MUTYH, POLE, RAD51B, RAD51C, RECQL4, SDHA, TERF2IP). The most frequently affected genes were CHEK2, ATM and FANC. In tumor samples from PGV carriers in ACD, BRIP1, MRE11, POLE, SDHA, TERF2IP, which were examined through exome sequencing, the main single base substitutions (SBS) mutational signature was SBS1+5+18, probably associated with age, tobacco smoking and reactive oxygen species. SBS3 associated with homologous repair deficiency was also represented, but on a lower scale. There was no difference in the frequency of PGV carriers between: (a) patients with or without first-degree relatives with cancer; and (b) patients with admixed ancestry versus those with predominantly European ancestry. Furthermore, there was no difference in overall survival between PGV carriers and non-carriers. Therefore, genetic testing should be offered to all Brazilian pancreatic cancer patients, regardless of their ancestry. Genes with limited or previously unrecognized associations with pancreatic cancer should be further investigated to clarify their role in cancer risk."
39255537,Durable benefit from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer in routine practice: biomarker associations and implications for optimal clinical next-generation sequencing testing.,"BACKGROUND: Controlled trials have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and BRCA1 or BRCA2 alterations (BRCAalt). However, the reported efficacy of PARPi for alterations in other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes is less consistent. We sought to evaluate the routine practice effectiveness of PARPi between and within these groups. DESIGN: Patient-level data from a deidentified nationwide (USA-based) cancer clinico-genomic database between January 2011 and September 2023 were extracted. Patients with mCRPC and comprehensive genomic profiling by liquid biopsy [circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)] or tissue (tumor) biopsy and who received single-agent PARPi were included and grouped by BRCAalt, ATMalt, other HRR, or no HRR. We further subcategorized BRCAalt into homozygous loss (BRCAloss) and all other deleterious BRCAalt (otherBRCAalt). RESULTS: A total of 445 patients met inclusion criteria: 214 with tumor and 231 with ctDNA. BRCAalt had more favorable outcomes to PARPi compared with ATM, other HRR, and no HRR groups. Within the BRCAalt subgroup, compared with other BRCAalt, BRCAloss had a more favorable time to next treatment (median 9 versus 19.4 months, P = 0.005), time to treatment discontinuation (median 8 versus 14 months, P = 0.006), and routine practice overall survival (median 14.7 versus 19.4 months, P = 0.016). Tumor BRCAloss prevalence (3.1%) was similar to ctDNA prevalence in liquid biopsy specimens with high tumor fraction (>20%). BRCAloss was not detected in orthogonal germline testing. CONCLUSIONS: PARPi routine practice effectiveness between groups mirrors prospective trials. Within the BRCAalt group, BRCAloss had the best outcomes. Unless the ctDNA tumor fraction is very high, somatic tissue testing (archival or metastatic) should be prioritized to identify patients who may benefit most from PARPi. When tissue testing is not clinically feasible, sufficient ctDNA tumor fraction levels for detection are enriched at clinical timepoints associated with tumor progression."
39254825,RNA sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry reveal the factors for postoperative recurrence of stage IB-IIA cervical squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Stage IB-IIA Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) presents diverse clinical outcomes, the mechanisms that cause recurrence in CC patients remain unclear. The goal of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers leading to tumor recurrence in IB-IIA CSCC after surgical treatment by comparing the transcriptional and immune landscape between the recurrence and non-recurrence group. METHODS: We performed mRNA sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) analysis among stage IB-IIA patients with or without recurrence after surgical resection and were followed-up for a median of three years. RESULTS: Integrated analysis indicates that the upregulated gene expression in zinc finger proteins, the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and the low infiltration level of T follicular helper cells and B-cells may serve as potential recurrent biomarkers for CSCC. We also observed significant differences in the immune and genomic landscape between two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the relapse mechanisms of CSCC, which could potentially guide clinical exploration of drug targets."
39254651,"Pan-cancer genomic analysis reveals FOXA1 amplification is associated with adverse outcomes in non-small cell lung, prostate, and breast cancers.","BACKGROUND: Alterations in forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a pioneer transcription factor, are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and prostate cancer. We characterized FOXA1 genomic alterations and their clinical impacts in a large pan-cancer cohort from the American Association for Cancer Research Genomics, Evidence, Neoplasia, Information, Exchange database. METHODS: FOXA1 alterations were characterized across more than 87 000 samples from more than 30 cancer types for primary and metastatic tumors alongside patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. FOXA1 alterations were queried in the Memorial Sloan Kettering - Metastatic Events and Tropisms (MSK-MET) cohort (a GENIE subset), allowing definition of hazard ratios (HRs) and survival estimates based on Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: FOXA1 was altered in 1869 (2.1%) samples, with distinct patterns across different cancers: prostate cancer enriched with indel-inframe alterations, breast cancer with missense mutations, and lung cancers with copy number amplifications. Of 74 715 samples with FOXA1 copy number profiles, amplification was detected in 834 (1.1%). Amplification was most common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 3% in primary; 6% in metastatic) and small cell lung cancer (4.1% primary; 3.5% metastatic), followed by breast cancer (2% primary; 1.6% metastatic) and prostate cancer (2.2% primary; 1.6% metastatic). Copy number amplifications were associated with decreased overall survival in NSCLC (HR = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.99; P = .02), breast cancer (HR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.89 to 4.89; P = 4e-6), and prostate cancer (HR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.03 to 3.68; P = .04). Amplifications were associated with widespread metastases in NSCLC, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: FOXA1 demonstrates distinct alteration profiles across cancer sites. Our findings suggest an association between FOXA1 amplification and enhanced metastatic potential and decreased survival, highlighting prognostic and therapeutic potential in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC."
39253786,MED12 and CDK8/19 Modulate Androgen Receptor Activity and Enzalutamide Response in Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer progression is driven by androgen receptor (AR) activity, which is a target for therapeutic approaches. Enzalutamide is an AR inhibitor that prolongs the survival of patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, resistance mechanisms arise and impair its efficacy. One of these mechanisms is the expression of AR-V7, a constitutively active AR splice variant. The Mediator complex is a multisubunit protein that modulates gene expression on a genome-wide scale. MED12 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)8, or its paralog CDK19, are components of the kinase module that regulates the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. In this study, we investigated how MED12 and CDK8/19 influence cancer-driven processes in prostate cancer cell lines, focusing on AR activity and the enzalutamide response. We inhibited MED12 expression and CDK8/19 activity in LNCaP (AR+, enzalutamide-sensitive), 22Rv1 (AR-V7+, enzalutamide-resistant), and PC3 (AR-, enzalutamide-insensitive) cells. Both MED12 and CDK8/19 inhibition reduced cell proliferation in all cell lines, and MED12 inhibition reduced proliferation in the respective 3D spheroids. MED12 knockdown significantly inhibited c-Myc protein expression and signaling pathways. In 22Rv1 cells, it consistently inhibited the AR response, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) secretion, AR target genes, and AR-V7 expression. Combined with enzalutamide, MED12 inhibition additively decreased the AR activity in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. CDK8/19 inhibition significantly decreased PSA secretion in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells and, when combined with enzalutamide, additively reduced proliferation in 22Rv1 cells. Our study revealed that MED12 and CDK8/19 regulate AR activity and that their inhibition may modulate response to enzalutamide in prostate cancer."
39252461,Unveiling the Impact of Epstein-Barr Virus on the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Given the consistent detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in prostate tissues and the clinical evidence suggesting its involvement in prostate cancer (PCa), the potential association between EBV infection and PCa warrants further investigation. This study aimed to assess the causal relationship between EBV infection and PCa using Mendelian randomization (MR). We utilized data from a publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) on PCa, alongside data on five serum anti-EBV virus-related antibodies. Our findings indicate a potential causal link between serum EBV EA-D antibody levels and an increased risk of PCa. These results highlight the need for additional research to elucidate the mechanisms by which EBV may contribute to the progression of PCa, potentially offering new insights into its pathogenesis and therapeutic targets."
39252314,"Association between prostate cancer and susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19: Based on a Mendelian randomization study.","Several observational studies indicated a close association between prostate cancer and COVID-19. Nevertheless, whether there was a causal effect between them remained obscure. In this study, we aimed to detect the potential association between genetically determined prostate cancer and the risk of COVID-19. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted to investigate the causal links between prostate cancer and COVID-19. Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode were used to estimate the causality. PIVW < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The top single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer cases (n = 79,148) and COVID-19 cases (n = 54,071) were extracted from the summary genome-wide association study data obtained from a publicly available database. Cochran Q test was utilized to calculate the degree of heterogeneity. Additionally, we validated our findings in another replication cohort. In the forward MR study, the IVW method suggested no evidence for the causal effect of prostate cancer on COVID-19 susceptibility (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.98-1.02, P = .978), COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 1.05, 95%CI: 0.99-1.09, P = .054), and COVID-19 severity (OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.95-1.11, P = .453). Reverse MR analysis also showed no causal effect of COVID-19 diverse phenotypes on prostate cancer. Furthermore, the result of the East Asian cohort study was consistent with the European cohort. Sensitivity analysis showed no evidence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. We did not discover genetic evidence to substantiate causal links between prostate cancer and COVID-19. Large-scale randomized controlled trials were required to enhance a more profound comprehension of this relationship in the future."
39247608,Integrated analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq reveals MMP mediated expression patterns by distinct tumor microenvironment immune profiles in cervical cancer.,"Background: Few studies have analyzed the effect of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression patterns on the tumor microenvironment (TME) during development of cervical cancer (CC). Methods: We elucidated the landscape and score of MMP expression in CC using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and RNA sequencing datasets. Further, we aimed the MMPscore to probe the infiltration of immune cells. Further, MMP expression was measured by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: We found MMPs were cell-type specific expressed in diverse types of CC cells, regulating the relative pathways of CC progression. Two distinct MMP expression patterns that associated infiltrated tumor microenvironment (TME) were identified. We discovered MMP expression patterns can predict the stage of tumor, subtype, stromal activity in the TME, genetic variation, and patient outcome. Patients with high MMPscore benefited from significantly better treatment and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: These results indicate high MMPscore in diverse cell types may regulate immune response and improve the survival of patients with CC, which assist in developing more effective immunization strategies."
39246954,Promoter Hypermethylation of the BRCA1 Gene as a Novel Biomarker for Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is recognized as one of the most common malignancies that greatly affects the male population globally. Breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) is an important tumor suppressor gene that plays a central role in the maintenance of genomic integrity by promoting the repair of double-strand breaks of DNA. Here, we present a pilot study to examine the promoter methylation and gene expression of the BRCA1 gene in patients with PCa in Erbil governorate, Iraq. The collection of samples took place in Erbil City, Iraq, specifically at Rizgary Hospital, PAR Hospital, and Al-Mufti's private laboratory. A total of 40 tissue samples were collected from age-matched individuals, comprising 30 pathologically confirmed PCa cases and 10 normal prostatic tissue taken from individuals who, during diagnosis, were found to be negative for PCa. Data on demographic and clinical information, such as pathological stage, age, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, were gathered from the medical records. The impact of the promoter methylation was forecasted using the DNA bisulfite conversion technique and methyl-specific PCR (MSP) with specific primers for the BRCA1 promoter region. The assessment of BRCA1 expression was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 30 patients examined, 76.6% (23 cases) were found to have BRCA1 promoter methylation, and none of the normal tissues appeared to have DNA methylation. BRCA1 promoter methylation was positively associated with the advanced stage of disease (p=0.01) and Gleason score (p=0.007). The analysis revealed a significant downregulation of the BRCA1 gene expression in methylated tumor samples as compared to non-methylated tumors and normal tissues, suggesting the role of epigenetic silencing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating methylation status and level of BRCA1 mRNA transcripts among PCa patients in Iraq. Our findings suggest that promoter hypermethylation of the BRCA1 gene could serve as a viable biomarker for PCa, marking a significant discovery."
39244641,Prevention of prostate cancer metastasis by a CRISPR-delivering nanoplatform for interleukin-30 genome editing.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men worldwide. Interleukin-30 (IL-30) is a PC progression driver, and its suppression would be strategic for fighting metastatic disease. Biocompatible lipid nanoparticles (NPs) were loaded with CRISPR-Cas9gRNA to delete the human IL30 (hIL30) gene and functionalized with anti-PSCA-Abs (Cas9hIL30-PSCA NPs). Efficiency of the NPs in targeting IL-30 and the metastatic potential of PC cells was examined in vivo in xenograft models of lung metastasis, and in vitro by using two organ-on-chip (2-OC)-containing 3D spheroids of IL30(+) PC-endothelial cell co-cultures in circuit with either lung-mimicking spheroids or bone marrow (BM)-niche-mimicking scaffolds. Cas9hIL30-PSCA NPs demonstrated circulation stability, genome editing efficiency, without off-target effects and organ toxicity. Intravenous injection of three doses/13 days, or five doses/20 days, of NPs in mice bearing circulating PC cells and tumor microemboli substantially hindered lung metastasization. Cas9hIL30-PSCA NPs inhibited PC cell proliferation and expression of IL-30 and metastasis drivers, such as CXCR2, CXCR4, IGF1, L1CAM, METAP2, MMP2, and TNFSF10, whereas CDH1 was upregulated. PC-Lung and PC-BM 2-OCs revealed that Cas9hIL30-PSCA NPs suppressed PC cell release of CXCL2/GRObeta, which was associated with intra-metastatic myeloid cell infiltrates, and of DKK1, OPG, and IL-6, which boosted endothelial network formation and cancer cell migration. Development of a patient-tailored nanoplatform for selective CRISPR-mediated IL-30 gene deletion is a clinically valuable tool against PC progression."
39242942,Integrative proteogenomic profiling of high-risk prostate cancer samples from Chinese patients indicates metabolic vulnerabilities and diagnostic biomarkers.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) exhibits significant geoethnic disparities as reflected by distinct variations in the cancer genome and disease progression. Here, we perform a comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of localized high-risk PCa utilizing paired tumors and nearby tissues from 125 Chinese male patients, with the primary objectives of identifying potential biomarkers, unraveling critical oncogenic events and delineating molecular subtypes with poor prognosis. Our integrated analysis highlights the utility of GOLM1 as a noninvasive serum biomarker. Phosphoproteomics analysis reveals the crucial role of Ser331 phosphorylation on FOXA1 in regulating FOXA1-AR-dependent cistrome. Notably, our proteomic profiling identifies three distinct subtypes, with metabolic immune-desert tumors (S-III) emerging as a particularly aggressive subtype linked to poor prognosis and BCAT2 catabolism-driven PCa progression. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive resource detailing the unique proteomic and phosphoproteomic characteristics of PCa molecular pathogenesis and offering valuable insights for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
39242706,Prostate cancer subtyping and differential methylation analysis based on the ETS family of transcription factors fusion genes.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heterogeneous disease, encompassing various molecular and clinical pathological subtypes. Fusion genes play a facilitating role in the occurrence and progression of PCa. We categorized PCa samples into the ETS family of transcription factors fusion positive and fusion negative subtypes based on fusion genes. This subtyping method is closely related to the epigenomic DNA methylation profiles of PCa, with each sample cluster including more than 85% of the patients. We conducted an analysis of the distribution of the ETS family fusion genes on chromosomes, fusion modes within reading frames, and predictions of structural domains. Among these, the highest frequency of the ETS family related fusion genes occurred on chromosome 21. Compared to the parental genes, fusion genes exhibited new structural domains, such as IG_like, and the most common fusion mode was out-of-frame fusion. The correlation between the methylation levels of hypermethylated CpG sites and the expression levels of their corresponding mRNAs indicates that CD8A and B3GNT5 (with correlations of - 0.388 and - 0.253, respectively) could serve as potential prognostic markers for PCa."
39241481,HSP90/LSD1 dual inhibitors against prostate cancer as well as patient-derived colorectal organoids.,"The rational installation of pharmacophores targeting HSP90 and LSD1 axes has achieved significant anti-cancer capacity in prostate and colorectal cancer. Among the series of hybrids, inhibitor 6 exhibited remarkable anti-proliferative activity against prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145, with GI(50) values of 0.24 and 0.30 muM, respectively. It demonstrated notable efficacy in combinatorial attack and cell death initiation towards apoptosis. The cell death process was mediated by PARP induction and gammaH2AX signaling, and was also characterized as caspase-dependent and Bcl-xL/Bax-independent. Notably, no difference in eye size or morphology was observed in the zebrafish treated with compound 6 compared to the reference group (AUY922). The profound treatment response in docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cells highlighted the dual inhibitory ability in improving docetaxel sensitivity. Additionally, at a minimum concentration of 1.25 muM, compound 6 effectively inhibited the growth of patient-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) organoids for up to 10 days in vitro. Together, the designed HSP90/LSD1 inhibitors present a novel route and significant clinical value for anti-cancer drug therapy."
39241313,Treatment Intensification With Novel Hormonal Therapy in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Patient Identification and Clinical Rationale.,"The clinical rationale for treatment of castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) with novel hormonal therapy (NHT) or androgen receptor pathway inhibitor is reviewed. A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant publications on NHTs for CSPC treatment. Level 1 clinical evidence demonstrated that intensification of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with NHT prolongs life and improves or maintains quality of life in patients with metastatic CSPC (mCSPC). Despite these results, real-world evidence demonstrated that 47%-88% of patients with mCSPC are treated with single agent ADT. Possible explanations for the underutilization of NHTs include patient characteristics, misperceptions about the overall survival benefit, lack of physician and patient awareness of the magnitude of clinical trial results, physician bias, safety concerns, misconceptions about the magnitude of prostate-specific antigen response needed for patient improvement, and barriers to NHT access. For patients with biochemical recurrence and no evidence of metastatic disease, limited clinical data exist with no consensus on an effective treatment strategy. Therefore, treatment strategies are developed using patient risk stratification according to clinicopathological characteristics, genomics, and next-generation imaging. Patients with high-risk biochemical recurrence may benefit from the early initiation of NHT based on outcomes from the phase III EMBARK trial. Lifestyle management is also an important aspect of treatment for CSPC, helping to mitigate the side effects of hormonal treatment and ensuring patients can maintain treatment while optimizing quality of life. In conclusion, to improve outcomes in patients with mCSPC, it is important to implement solutions addressing the barriers to underutilization of treatment intensification."
39240414,Multifaceted role of the DNA replication protein MCM10 in maintaining genome stability and its implication in human diseases.,"MCM10 plays a vital role in genome duplication and is crucial for DNA replication initiation, elongation, and termination. It coordinates several proteins to assemble at the fork, form a functional replisome, trigger origin unwinding, and stabilize the replication bubble. MCM10 overexpression is associated with increased aggressiveness in breast, cervical, and several other cancers. Disruption of MCM10 leads to altered replication timing associated with initiation site gains and losses accompanied by genome instability. Knockdown of MCM10 affects the proliferation and migration of cancer cells, manifested by DNA damage and replication fork arrest, and has recently been shown to be associated with clinical conditions like CNKD and RCM. Loss of MCM10 function is associated with impaired telomerase activity, leading to the accumulation of abnormal replication forks and compromised telomere length. MCM10 interacts with histones, aids in nucleosome assembly, binds BRCA2 to maintain genome integrity during DNA damage, prevents lesion skipping, and inhibits PRIMPOL-mediated repriming. It also interacts with the fork reversal enzyme SMARCAL1 and inhibits fork regression. Additionally, MCM10 undergoes several post-translational modifications and contributes to transcriptional silencing by interacting with the SIR proteins. This review explores the mechanism associated with MCM10's multifaceted role in DNA replication initiation, chromatin organization, transcriptional silencing, replication stress, fork stability, telomere length maintenance, and DNA damage response. Finally, we discuss the role of MCM10 in the early detection of cancer, its prognostic significance, and its potential use in therapeutics for cancer treatment."
39240303,TET3 is expressed in prostate cancer tumor-associated macrophages and is associated with anti-androgen resistance.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of TET3 in prostate cancer and its effect on the efficacy of anti-androgen therapy (ADT). METHODS: The expression of TET3 in 1965 cases of prostate cancer and 493 cases of normal prostate tissues were analyzed. The CIBERSORT algorithm evaluated the abundance of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cells in 497 prostate cancers. Subsequently, the expression of TET3 in prostate cancer TAMs was analyzed using 21,292 cells from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). In addition, the trajectory of the differentiation process was reconstructed based on pseudotime analysis. Sensitivity prediction of prostate cancers to ADT was evaluated based on GDSC2 and CTRP databases. Another dataset GSE111177 was employed for further analysis. RESULTS: TET3 was over-expressed in prostate cancer, and the expression of TET3 in metastatic prostate cancer was higher than that in non-metastatic prostate cancer. The scRNAseq analysis of prostate cancer showed that TET3 was mainly expressed in TAM. TET3 expressed in early and active TAMs, with the activation of signaling pathways such as energy metabolism, cell communication, and cytokine production. Prostate cancer in TET3 high expression group was more sensitive to ADT drugs such as Bicalutamide and AZD3514, and was also more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs such as Cyclophosphamide, Paclitaxel, and Vincristine, and MAPK pathway inhibitors of Docetaxel and Dabrafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ADT in prostate cancer is related to the expression of TET3 in TAMs, and TET3 may be a potential therapeutic target for coordinating ADT."
39239847,Simultaneous detection of eight cancer types using a multiplex droplet digital PCR assay.,"DNA methylation biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for cancer detection. Common methylation patterns across tumor types allow multi-cancer detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has gained considerable attention for methylation detection. However, multi-cancer detection using multiple targets in ddPCR has never been performed before. Therefore, we developed a multiplex ddPCR assay for multi-cancer detection. Based on previous data analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we selected differentially methylated targets for eight frequent tumor types (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, head and neck, liver, and esophageal cancer). Three targets were validated using ddPCR in 103 tumor and 109 normal adjacent fresh frozen samples. Two distinct ddPCR assays were successfully developed. Output data from both assays is combined to obtain a read-out from the three targets together. Our overall ddPCR assay has a cross-validated area under the curve (cvAUC) of 0.948. Performance between distinct cancer types varies, with sensitivities ranging from 53.8% to 100% and specificities ranging from 80% to 100%. Compared to previously published single-target parameters, we show that combining targets can drastically increase sensitivity and specificity, while lowering DNA input. In conclusion, we are the first to report a multi-cancer methylation ddPCR assay, which allows for highly accurate tumor predictions."
39239512,A novel assessment of whole-mount Gleason grading in prostate cancer to identify candidates for radical prostatectomy: a machine learning-based multiomics study.,"Purpose: This study aims to assess whole-mount Gleason grading (GG) in prostate cancer (PCa) accurately using a multiomics machine learning (ML) model and to compare its performance with biopsy-proven GG (bxGG) assessment. Materials and Methods: A total of 146 patients with PCa recruited in a pilot study of a prospective clinical trial (NCT02659527) were retrospectively included in the side study, all of whom underwent (68)Ga-PSMA-11 integrated positron emission tomography (PET) / magnetic resonance (MR) before radical prostatectomy (RP) between May 2014 and April 2020. To establish a multiomics ML model, we quantified PET radiomics features, pathway-level genomics features from whole exome sequencing, and pathomics features derived from immunohistochemical staining of 11 biomarkers. Based on the multiomics dataset, five ML models were established and validated using 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation. Results: Among five ML models, the random forest (RF) model performed best in terms of the area under the curve (AUC). Compared to bxGG assessment alone, the RF model was superior in terms of AUC (0.87 vs 0.75), specificity (0.72 vs 0.61), positive predictive value (0.79 vs 0.75), and accuracy (0.78 vs 0.77) and showed slightly decreased sensitivity (0.83 vs 0.89) and negative predictive value (0.80 vs 0.81). Among the feature categories, bxGG was identified as the most important feature, followed by pathomics, clinical, radiomics and genomics features. The three important individual features were bxGG, PSA staining and one intensity-related radiomics feature. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a superior assessment of the developed multiomics-based ML model in whole-mount GG compared to the current clinical baseline of bxGG. This enables personalized patient management by identifying high-risk PCa patients for RP."
39239510,Impact of TP53 loss-of-function alterations on the response to PSMA radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.,"Rationale: PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) has shown promise in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly in PSMA-avid tumours. However, predicting response remains challenging. Preclinical data suggests aberrant p53-signalling as a predictor of poor response. Methods: The patient population of this pre-planned retrospective cohort study consists of 96 patients with mCRPC who underwent treatment with PSMA-RLT and were molecularly profiled by whole-genome sequencing and or targeted next-generation sequencing. Response to PSMA-RLT was assessed per molecular subtype, including TP53-mutational status. Results: Patients with TP53 loss-of-function alterations had a shorter median progression-free survival (3.7 versus 6.2 months, P<0.001), a lower median PSA change (-55% vs. -75%, P=0.012) and shorter overall survival from initiation of PMSA-RLT (7.6 vs. 13.9 months, P=0.003) compared to TP53-wildtype patients. Pathogenic alterations in AR, MYC, BRCA1, or BRCA2 as well as in genes linked to the PI3K or MAPK pathways or genes involved in homologous recombination repair, were not associated with response. Only lactate dehydrogenase was, alongside TP53-status, significantly associated with response. Transcriptome analysis of 21 patients, identified six p53 signalling genes whose low expression was associated to a shorter progression-free survival (P<0.05). Conclusion: TP53 loss-of-function may serve as a prognostic factor for PSMA-RLT outcomes in patients with mCRPC."
39237680,Active surveillance selection and 3-year durability in intermediate-risk prostate cancer following genomic testing.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic testing can add risk stratification information to clinicopathological features in prostate cancer, aiding in shared medical decision-making between the clinician and patient regarding whether active surveillance (AS) or definitive treatment (DT) is most appropriate. Here we examined initial AS selection and 3-year AS durability in patients diagnosed with localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent Prolaris testing before treatment decision-making. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included 3208 patients from 10 study sites who underwent Prolaris testing at diagnosis from September 2015 to December 2018. Prolaris utilizes a combined clinical cell cycle risk score calculated at diagnostic biopsy to stratify patients by the Prolaris AS threshold (below threshold, patient recommended to AS or above threshold, patient recommended to DT). AS selection rates and 3-year AS durability were compared in patients recommended to AS or DT by Prolaris testing. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard models were used with molecular and clinical variables as predictors of initial treatment decision and AS durability, respectively. RESULTS: AS selection was ~2 times higher in patients recommended to AS by Prolaris testing than in those recommended to DT (p < 0.0001). Three-year AS durability was ~1.5 times higher in patients recommended to AS by Prolaris testing than in those recommended to DT (p < 0.0001). Prolaris treatment recommendation remained a statistically significant predictor of initial AS selection and AS durability after accounting for CAPRA or Gleason scores. CONCLUSIONS: Prolaris added significant information to clinical risk stratification to aid in treatment decision making. Intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients who were recommended to AS by Prolaris were more likely to initially pursue AS and were more likely to remain on AS at 3 years post-diagnosis than patients recommended to DT."
39234247,Autoantibodies in cancer: a systematic review of their clinical role in the most prevalent cancers.,"Although blood autoantibodies were initially associated with autoimmune diseases, multiple evidence have been accumulated showing their presence in many types of cancer. This has opened their use in clinics, since cancer autoantibodies might be useful for early detection, prognosis, and monitoring of cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the different techniques available for their discovery and validation. Additionally, we discuss here in detail those autoantibody panels verified in at least two different reports that should be more likely to be specific of each of the four most incident cancers. We also report the recent developed kits for breast and lung cancer detection mostly based on autoantibodies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets because of the screening of the cancer humoral immune response. Finally, we discuss unsolved issues that still need to be addressed for the implementation of cancer autoantibodies in clinical routine for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and/or monitoring."
39232886,[Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and PARP inhibitors: From tumor genomics to new therapeutic combinations].,"Castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer remains lethal and a therapeutic challenge. Current strategies are geared towards the personalization of treatments based on the identification of relevant molecular targets, including genomic alterations involved in tumoral processes. Among these novel targeted therapies, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), by blocking the action of enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, induce the destruction of cells carrying defects in homologous recombination repair, often associated with alterations in genes involved in this mechanism. Thus, determining the presence of a molecular anomaly, particularly alterations in the BRCA1/2 genes, is a prerequisite for initiating PARPi monotherapy. In patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer , around 20-30 % carry this type of mutation. In this population, single-agent studies have demonstrated PARPi ability to prolong overall survival, and to improve symptom control, including pain. Other studies are underway to assess their effectiveness in combination with other therapies, and it already appears that association with new-generation hormone therapy can further prolong radiological progression-free survival, regardless of the mutation status of the genes involved in DNA repair, indicating a synergistic action between PARPi and new-generation hormone therapy."
39232464,Global and single-cell proteomics view of the co-evolution between neural progenitors and breast cancer cells in a co-culture model.,"BACKGROUND: Presence of nerves in tumours, by axonogenesis and neurogenesis, is gaining increased attention for its impact on cancer initiation and development, and the new field of cancer neuroscience is emerging. A recent study in prostate cancer suggested that the tumour microenvironment may influence cancer progression by recruitment of Doublecortin (DCX)-expressing neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, the presence of such cells in human breast tumours has not been comprehensively explored. METHODS: Here, we investigate the presence of DCX-expressing cells in breast cancer stromal tissue from patients using Imaging Mass Cytometry. Single-cell analysis of 372,468 cells across histopathological images of 107 breast cancers enabled spatial resolution of neural elements in the stromal compartment in correlation with clinicopathological features of these tumours. In parallel, we established a 3D in vitro model mimicking breast cancer neural progenitor-innervation and examined the two cell types as they co-evolved in co-culture by using mass spectrometry-based global proteomics. FINDINGS: Stromal presence of DCX + cells is associated with tumours of higher histological grade, a basal-like phenotype, and shorter patient survival in tumour tissue from patients with breast cancer. Global proteomics analysis revealed significant changes in the proteomic landscape of both breast cancer cells and neural progenitors in co-culture. INTERPRETATION: These results support that neural involvement plays an active role in breast cancer and warrants further studies on the relevance of nerve elements for tumour progression. FUNDING: This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway through its Centre of Excellence funding scheme, project number 223250 (to L.A.A), the Norwegian Cancer Society (to L.A.A. and H.V.), the Regional Health Trust Western Norway (Helse Vest) (to L.A.A.), the Meltzer Research Fund (to H.V.) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/NIGMS grant R01 GM132129 (to J.A.P.)."
39232121,Immunoliposome-based targeted delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9gRNA-IL30 complex inhibits prostate cancer and prolongs survival.,"The development of selective and nontoxic immunotherapy targeting prostate cancer (PC) is challenging. Interleukin (IL)30 plays immunoinhibitory and oncogenic roles in PC, and its tumor-specific suppression may have significant clinical implications. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated IL30 gene deletion in PC xenografts using anti-PSCA antibody-driven lipid nanocomplexes (Cas9gRNA-hIL30-PSCA NxPs) revealed significant genome editing efficiency and circulation stability without off-target effects or organ toxicity. Biweekly intravenous administration of Cas9gRNA-hIL30-PSCA NxPs to PC-bearing mice inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and improved survival. Mechanistically, Cas9gRNA-hIL30-PSCA NxPs suppressed ANGPTL 1/2/4, IL1beta, CCL2, CXCL1/6, SERPINE1-F1, EFNB2, PLG, PF4, VEGFA, VEGFD, ANG, TGFbeta1, EGF and HGF expression in human PC cells while upregulated CDH1, DKK3 and PTEN expression, leading to low proliferation and extensive ischemic necrosis. In the syngeneic PC model, IL30-targeting immunoliposomes downregulated NFKB1 expression and prevented intratumoral influx of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+)MDCs, Foxp3(+)Tregs, and NKp46(+)RORgammat(+)ILC3, and prolonged host survival by inhibiting tumor progression. This study serves as a proof of principle that immunoliposome-based targeted delivery of Cas9gRNA-IL30 represent a potentially safe and effective strategy for PC treatment."
39230769,Molecular subtypes and nomogram for predicting the prognosis of cervical cancer based on a matrix-immune signature.,"Cervical cancer is a kind of tumor related to chronic HPV infection. Currently, the treatment of cervical cancer is guided mainly by clinicopathological factors. The role of tumor microenvironment in the prognosis and treatment of cervical cancer has been ignored. We aimed to use bioinformatics to identify the molecular subtypes in cervical cancer and construct a predictive nomogram combining a matrix-immune signature (MIS) and clinicopathological factors to support treatment decisions. Two cervical cancer subtypes with different prognoses were identified based on matrix- and immune-genes in TCGA-CESC. The MIS was developed using Cox regression and Lasso algorithm and verified in the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Multivariable analysis identified lymph node metastases, lymphovascular space invasion, and the MIS as independent prognostic factors, which were used to construct the predictive nomogram. The areas under the ROC curve of the model were 0.872, 0.879, and 0.803 for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods, respectively. The C-index was 0.845. Calibration curves confirmed the excellent prognosis prediction of the nomogram. The nomogram indicted a 3-year survival rate of > 90% in patients with a total score > 110.1. The constructed predictive nomogram has significant implications for prognostic assessment and treatment selection in cervical cancer."

39230420,Whole-exome Sequence Analysis of Gastric-type Adenocarcinoma of the Uterine Cervix and Adjacent Lobular Endocervical Glandular Hyperplasia in the Same Case.,"Lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH) may be a precursor lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix (GAS). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying its carcinogenesis remain unclear. To elucidate the oncogenic process from LEGH to GAS, we compared gene mutations in early-stage GAS and adjacent LEGH in the same case. Fresh-frozen tissue sections were obtained from a patient with Stage IB3 GAS and adjacent LEGH who had undergone hysterectomy. Using laser microdissection, we harvested the LEGH and GAS portions separately from these sections and extracted the genomic DNA. Somatic variant analysis using whole-exome sequencing used DNA from the normal myometrium as a reference sequence. Somatic variants involving amino acid substitutions were detected in 61 and 125 locations in LEGH and GAS, respectively. Seven variants were common in both lesions, of which the pathogenic variant was GNAS only (c.2531G>A, p.R844H), a mutation frequently reported in pancreatic and colorectal cancers. LEGH had no other pathogenic variants; another pathogenic variant in GAS was found only at the same amino acid site as GNAS (c.2530C>T, p.R844C). In the present case, LEGH and GAS shared the same pathogenic variant of GNAS , indicating that both lesions had a common origin. Furthermore, the current results showed that the second GNAS variant is associated with the progression of LEGH to GAS. Further studies are required to elucidate GAS's pathogenesis and biological characteristics."
39229204,Polyploid cancer cells reveal signatures of chemotherapy resistance.,"Therapeutic resistance in cancer significantly contributes to mortality, with many patients eventually experiencing recurrence after initial treatment responses. Recent studies have identified therapy-resistant large polyploid cancer cells in patient tissues, particularly in late-stage prostate cancer, linking them to advanced disease and relapse. Here, we analyzed bone marrow aspirates from 44 advanced prostate cancer patients and found the presence of circulating tumor cells with increased genomic content (CTC-IGC) was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival. Single cell copy number profiling of CTC-IGC displayed clonal origins with typical CTCs, suggesting complete polyploidization. Induced polyploid cancer cells from PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with docetaxel or cisplatin were examined through single cell DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and protein immunofluorescence. Novel RNA and protein markers, including HOMER1, TNFRSF9, and LRP1, were identified as linked to chemotherapy resistance. These markers were also present in a subset of patient CTCs and associated with recurrence in public gene expression data. This study highlights the prognostic significance of large polyploid tumor cells, their role in chemotherapy resistance, and their expression of markers tied to cancer relapse, offering new potential avenues for therapeutic development."
39229160,Extracellular Vesicles heterogeneity through the lens of multiomics.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogenous in size, biogenesis, cargo and function. Beside small EVs, aggressive tumor cells release a population of particularly large EVs, namely large oncosomes (LO). This study provides the first resource of label-free quantitative proteomics of LO and small EVs obtained from distinct cancer cell types (prostate, breast, and glioma). This dataset was integrated with a SWATH Proteomic assay on LO, rigorously isolated from the plasma of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Proteins enriched in LO, which were identified also at the RNA level, and found in plasma LO significantly correlated with PC progression. Single EV RNA-Seq of the PC cell-derived LO confirmed some of the main findings from the bulk RNA-Seq, providing first evidence that single cell technologies can be successfully applied to EVs. This multiomics resource of cancer EVs can be leveraged for developing a multi-analyte approach for liquid biopsy."
39229150,Rearrangement of 3D genome organization in breast cancer epithelial - mesenchymal transition and metastasis organotropism.,"Breast cancer cells exhibit organotropism during metastasis, showing preferential homing to certain organs such as bone, lung, liver, and brain. One potential explanation for this organotropic behavior is that cancer cells gain properties that enable thriving in certain microenvironments. Such specific metastatic traits may arise from gene regulation at the primary tumor site. Spatial genome organization plays a crucial role in oncogenic transformation and progression, but the extent to which chromosome architecture contributes to organ-specific metastatic traits is unclear. This work characterizes chromosome architecture changes associated with organotropic metastatic traits. By comparing a collection of genomic data from different subtypes of localized and lung metastatic breast cancer cells with both normal and cancerous lung cells, we find important trends of genomic reorganization. The most striking differences in 3D genome compartments segregate cell types according to their epithelial vs. mesenchymal status. This EMT compartment signature occurs at genomic regions distinct from transcription-defined EMT signatures, suggesting a separate layer of regulation. Specifically querying organotropism, we find 3D genome changes consistent with adaptations needed to survive in a new microenvironment, with lung metastatic breast cells exhibiting compartment switch signatures that shift the genome architecture to a lung cell-like conformation and brain metastatic prostate cancer cells showing compartment shifts toward a brain-like state. TCGA patient data reveals gene expression changes concordant with these organ-permissive compartment changes. These results suggest that genome architecture provides an additional level of cell fate specification informing organotropism and enabling survival at the metastatic site."
39228741,Divergent Evolution in Bilateral Prostate Cancer: a Case Study.,"Multifocal prostate cancer is a prevalent phenomenon, with most cases remaining uncharacterized from a genomic perspective. A patient presented with bilateral prostate cancer. On systematic biopsy, two indistinguishable clinicopathologic lesions were detected. Whole-genome sequencing displayed somatically unrelated tumours with distinct driver CNA regions, suggesting independent origins of the two tumors. We demonstrated that similar clinicopathologic multifocal tumours, which might be interpreted as clonal disease, can in fact represent independent cancers. Genetic prognostics can prevent mischaracterization of multifocal disease to enable optimal patient management."
39227594,Androgen receptor monomers and dimers regulate opposing biological processes in prostate cancer cells.,"Most prostate cancers express the androgen receptor (AR), and tumor growth and progression are facilitated by exceptionally low levels of systemic or intratumorally produced androgens. Thus, absolute inhibition of the androgen signaling axis remains the goal of current therapeutic approaches to treat prostate cancer (PCa). Paradoxically, high dose androgens also exhibit considerable efficacy as a treatment modality in patients with late-stage metastatic PCa. Here we show that low levels of androgens, functioning through an AR monomer, facilitate a non-genomic activation of the mTOR signaling pathway to drive proliferation. Conversely, high dose androgens facilitate the formation of AR dimers/oligomers to suppress c-MYC expression, inhibit proliferation and drive a transcriptional program associated with a differentiated phenotype. These findings highlight the inherent liabilities in current approaches used to inhibit AR action in PCa and are instructive as to strategies that can be used to develop new therapeutics for this disease and other androgenopathies."
39227454,Predictive value of polygenic risk score for prostate cancer incidence and prognosis in the Han Chinese.,"Although prostate cancer is a common occurrence among males, the relationship between existing risk prediction models remains unclear. The objective of this hospital-based retrospective study is to investigate the impact of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) on the incidence and prognosis of prostate cancer in the Han Chinese population. A total of 24,778 male participants including 903 patients with prostate cancer at Taichung Veterans General Hospital were enrolled in the study. PRS was calculated using 269 single nucleotide polymorphisms and their corresponding effect sizes from the polygenic score catalog. The association between PRS and the risk prostate cancer was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Among the 24,778 participants, 903 were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The risk of prostate cancer was significantly higher in the highest quartile of PRS distribution compared to the lowest (hazard ratio = 4.770, 95% CI = 3.999-5.689, p < 0.0001), with statistical significance across all age groups. Patients in the highest quartile were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a younger age (66.8 +/- 8.3 vs. 69.5 +/- 8.8, p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis of patients with localized or stage 4 prostate cancer showed no significant differences in biochemical failure or overall survival. This hospital-based cohort study observed that a higher PRS was associated with increased susceptibility to prostate cancer and younger age of diagnosis. However, PRS was not found to be a significant predictor of disease stage and prognosis. These findings suggest that PRS could serve as a useful tool in prostate cancer risk assessment."
39226803,Up-regulated DSG2 promotes tumor growth and reduces immune infiltration in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Desmoglein-2 (DSG2) has been reported to play pivotal roles in various diseases. However, its roles in cervical cancer (CC) remain insufficiently elucidated. Here, we aimed to comprehensively explore the functional mechanisms of DSG2 in CC using bioinformatics and experimental methods. METHODS: Several online databases, including Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), ONCOMINE, LinkedOmics, MetaScape, Human protein atlas (HPA), OMICS and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used to explore the expression, prognosis, gene mutations, and potential signaling pathway of DSG2 in CC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to measure DSG2 expression in collected samples. Experimental assays were conducted to verify the effects of dysregulated DSG2 on cervical cell lines in vitro. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analyses revealed that DSG2 was significantly up-regulated in CC compared to normal cervical tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Elevated DSG2 levels were also associated with poor prognosis and clinical parameters (e.g., cancer stages, tumor grade, nodal metastasis status, etc.). DSG2 expression was predominantly observed in epithelial cells, increasing with disease progression on a single-cell resolution. Additionally, up-regulation of DSG2 significantly enhanced tumor purity by reducing the infiltration of immune cells (e.g., B cells, T cells, NK cells, etc.). Over-expression of DSG2 was further validated in collected CC samples at both mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of DSG2 markedly reduced the proliferation and invasion of CC cell lines in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, elevated levels of DSG2 were significantly associated with poor prognosis and diminished immune infiltration in CC. Thus, DSG2 may serve as a potential therapeutic and diagnostic biomarker for CC."
39226661,PLXNA1 confers enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer via AKT signaling pathway.,"Although targeting the androgen signaling pathway by androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide, has shown therapeutic effectiveness, inevitable emergence of acquired resistance remains a critical challenge in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Recognizing targetable genomic aberrations that trigger endocrine treatment failure holds great promise for advancing therapeutic interventions. Here, we characterized PLXNA1, amplified in a subset of PCa patients, as a contributor to enzalutamide resistance (ENZR). Elevated PLXNA1 expression facilitated PCa proliferation under enzalutamide treatment due to AKT signaling activation. Mechanistically, PLXNA1 recruited NRP1 forming a PLXNA1-NRP1 complex, which in turn potentiated the phosphorylation of the AKT. Either inhibiting PLXNA1-NRP1 complex with an NRP1 inhibitor, EG01377, or targeting PLXNA1-mediated ENZR with AKT inhibitors, abolished the pro-resistance phenotype of PLXNA1. Taken together, combination of AKT inhibitor and AR inhibitors presents a promising therapeutic strategy for PCa, especially in advanced PCa patients exhibiting PLXNA1 overexpression."
39226514,Bladder-Preserving Trimodality Treatment for High-Grade T1 Bladder Cancer: Results From Phase II Protocol NRG Oncology/RTOG 0926.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the use of radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapy following repeated transurethral resection (trimodality therapy) as an alternative to radical cystectomy in T1 bladder cancer which has failed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with recurrent T1 bladders who had failed BCG and were recommended to undergo cystectomy were treated with trimodality therapy. The primary end point was 3-year freedom from cystectomy. Secondary end points were distant metastasis at 3 and 5 years, local recurrence, disease-specific and overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: This single-arm phase II study enrolled 37 patients. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 34 patients after three exclusions. The median follow-up was 5.1 years. The 3-year freedom from cystectomy rate was 88% (lower one-sided 97.5% confidence limit [CI], 72%), meeting the primary study goal. OS at 3 and 5 years was 69% (95% CI, 54 to 85) and 56% (95% CI, 39 to 74), respectively. The distant metastasis rates at 3 and 5 years were 12% (95% CI, 4 to 26) and 19% (95% CI, 7 to 34), respectively. Eight patients died due to urothelial cancer, 12 exhibited local recurrence at 3 years (cumulative incidence: 32%; 95% CI, 17 to 48), 18 experienced grade 3 adverse events, mostly hematological, and one developed grade 4 neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Trimodality therapy is an effective potential alternative to radical cystectomy for recurrent high-grade T1 urothelial cancer of the bladder. At 3 years, 88% of the patients remained free of cystectomy."
39224598,Elucidating the role of tumor-associated ALOX5+ mast cells with transformative function in cervical cancer progression via single-cell RNA sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common malignancy among women globally and serves as the main cause of cancer-related deaths among women in developing countries. The early symptoms of CC are often not apparent, with diagnoses typically made at advanced stages, which lead to poor clinical prognoses. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that there is a close relationship between mast cells (MCs) and tumor development. However, research on the role MCs played in CC is still very limited at that time. Thus, the study conducted a single-cell multi-omics analysis on human CC cells, aiming to explore the mechanisms by which MCs interact with the tumor microenvironment in CC. The goal was to provide a scientific basis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CC, with the hope of improving patients' prognoses and quality of life. METHOD: The present study acquired single-cell RNA sequencing data from ten CC tumor samples in the ArrayExpress database. Slingshot and AUCcell were utilized to infer and assess the differentiation trajectory and cell plasticity of MCs subpopulations. Differential expression analysis of MCs subpopulations in CC was performed, employing Gene Ontology, gene set enrichment analysis, and gene set variation analysis. CellChat software package was applied to predict cell communication between MCs subpopulations and CC cells. Cellular functional experiments validated the functionality of TNFRSF12A in HeLa and Caski cell lines. Additionally, a risk scoring model was constructed to evaluate the differences in clinical features, prognosis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoint, and functional enrichment across various risk scores. Copy number variation levels were computed using inference of copy number variations. RESULT: The obtained 93,524 high-quality cells were classified into ten cell types, including T_NK cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, B cells, plasma cells, MCs, neutrophils, and myeloid cells. Furthermore, a total of 1,392 MCs were subdivided into seven subpopulations: C0 CTSG+ MCs, C1 CALR+ MCs, C2 ALOX5+ MCs, C3 ANXA2+ MCs, C4 MGP+ MCs, C5 IL32+ MCs, and C6 ADGRL4+ MCs. Notably, the C2 subpopulation showed close associations with tumor-related MCs, with Slingshot results indicating that C2 subpopulation resided at the intermediate-to-late stage of differentiation, potentially representing a crucial transition point in the benign-to-malignant transformation of CC. CNVscore and bulk analysis results further confirmed the transforming state of the C2 subpopulation. CellChat analysis revealed TNFRSF12A as a key receptor involved in the actions of C2 ALOX5+ MCs. Moreover, in vitro experiments indicated that downregulating the TNFRSF12A gene may partially inhibit the development of CC. Additionally, a prognosis model and immune infiltration analysis based on the marker genes of the C2 subpopulation provided valuable guidance for patient prognosis and clinical intervention strategies. CONCLUSIONS: We first identified the transformative tumor-associated MCs subpopulation C2 ALOX5+ MCs within CC, which was at a critical stage of tumor differentiation and impacted the progression of CC. In vitro experiments confirmed the inhibitory effect of knocking down the TNFRSF12A gene on the development of CC. The prognostic model constructed based on the C2 ALOX5+MCs subset demonstrated excellent predictive value. These findings offer a fresh perspective for clinical decision-making in CC."
39223207,Derivation of human primary prostate epithelial cell lines by differentially targeting the CDKN2A locus along with expression of hTERT.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer diagnosed in men worldwide and was the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in US males in 2022. Prostate cancer also represents the second highest cancer mortality disparity between non-Hispanic blacks and whites. However, there is a relatively small number of prostate normal and cancer cell lines compared to other cancers. To identify the molecular basis of PCa progression, it is important to have prostate epithelial cell (PrEC) lines as karyotypically normal as possible. Our lab recently developed a novel methodology for the rapid and efficient immortalization of normal human PrEC that combines simultaneous CRISPR-directed inactivation of CDKN2A exon 2 (which directs expression of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF)) and ectopic expression of an hTERT transgene. To optimize this methodology to generate immortalized lines with minimal genetic alterations, we sought to target exon 1alpha of the CDKN2A locus so that p16(INK4A) expression is ablated while the exons encoding p14(ARF) remains unaltered. Here we describe the establishment of two cell lines: one with the above-mentioned p16(INK4A) only loss, and a second line targeting both products in the CDKN2A locus. We characterize the potential lineage origin of these new cell lines along with our previously obtained clones, revealing distinct gene expression signatures. Based on the analyses of protein markers and RNA expression signatures, these cell lines are most closely related to a subpopulation of basal prostatic cells. Given the simplicity of this one-step methodology and the fact that it uses only the minimal genetic alterations necessary for immortalization, it should also be suitable for the establishment of cell lines from primary prostate tumor samples, an urgent need given the limited number of available prostate cancer cell lines."
39223118,PCaseek: ultraspecific urinary tumor DNA detection using deep learning for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading.,
39222914,"Establishing and Characterizing the Molecular Profiles, Cellular Features, and Clinical Utility of a Patient-Derived Xenograft Model Using Benign Prostatic Tissues.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition marked by the enlargement of the prostate gland, which often leads to significant urinary symptoms and a decreased quality of life. The development of clinically relevant animal models is crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of BPH and improving treatment options. This study aims to establish a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model using benign prostatic tissues to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms of BPH. PDXs were generated by implanting fresh BPH (transition zone) and paired normal (peripheral zone) prostate tissue from 8 patients under the renal capsule of immunodeficient male mice. Tissue weight, architecture, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, prostate-specific marker expression, and molecular profiles of PDXs were assessed after 1 week and 1, 2, or 3 months of implantation by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Responses to finasteride, a standard-of-care therapy, were evaluated. PDXs maintained histologic and molecular characteristics of the parental human tissues. BPH, but not normal PDXs, demonstrated significant increases in weight and cellular proliferation, particularly at 1 month. Molecular profiling revealed specific gene and protein expression patterns correlating with BPH pathophysiology. Specifically, an increased immune and stress response was observed at 1 week, followed by increased expression of proliferation markers and BPH-specific stromal signaling molecules, such as BMP5 and CXCL13, at 1 month. Graft stabilization to preimplant characteristics was apparent between 2 and 3 months. Treatment with finasteride reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced morphologic changes consistent with therapeutic responses observed in human BPH. Our PDX model recapitulates the morphologic, histologic, and molecular features of human BPH, offering a significant advancement in modeling the complex interactions of cell types in BPH microenvironments. These PDXs respond to therapeutic intervention as expected, providing a valuable tool for preclinical testing of new therapeutics that will improve the well-being of BPH patients."
39221762,Comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis to identify new markers of M2 macrophages for predicting the prognosis of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) has become the highest incidence of malignant tumor among men in the world. Tumor microenvironment (TME) is necessary for tumor growth. M2 macrophages play an important role in many solid tumors. This research aimed at the role of M2 macrophages' prognosis value in PCa. METHODS: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and mRNA expression data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Quality control, normalization, reduction, clustering, and cell annotation of scRNA-seq data were preformed using the Seruat package. The sub-populations of the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were analysis and the marker genes of M2 macrophage were selected. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PCa were identified using limma and the immune infiltration was detected using CIBERSORTx. Then, a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed to identify the M2 macrophage-related modules and genes. Integration of the marker genes of M2 macrophage from scRNA-seq data analysis and hub genes from WGCNA to select the prognostic gene signature based on Univariate and LASSO regression analysis. The risk score was calculated, and the DEGs, biological function, immune characteristics related to risk score were explored. And a predictive nomogram was constructed. CCK8, Transwell, and wound healing were used to verify cell phenotype changes after co-cultured. RESULTS: A total of 2431 marker genes of M2 macrophage and 650 hub M2 macrophage-related genes were selected based on scRNA-seq data and WGCNA. Then, 113 M2 macrophage-related genes were obtained by overlapping the scRNA-seq data and WGCNA results. Nine M2 macrophage-related genes (SMOC2, PLPP1, HES1, STMN1, GPR160, ABCG1, MAZ, MYC, and EPCAM) were screened as prognostic gene signatures. M2 risk score was calculated, the DEGs, Immune score, stromal score, ESTIMATE score, tumor purity, and immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and responses of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were identified. And a predictive nomogram was constructed. CCK8, Transwell invasion, and wound healing further verified that M2 macrophages promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered that M2 macrophages and relevant genes played key roles in promoting the occurrence, development, and metastases of PCa and played as convincing predictors in PCa."
39221528,The level of expression of HPV16 early transcripts is not associated with the natural history of cervical lesions.,"The natural history of cervical cancer is closely linked to that of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection. It is recognized that upon HPV DNA integration, partial or complete loss of the E2 open reading frame precludes expression of the corresponding protein, resulting in upregulation of the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. To better characterize HPV16 infection at the cervical level, viral load, viral DNA integration, and viral early transcript expression (E2, E5, and E6) were analyzed in a series of 158 cervical specimens representative of the full spectrum of cervical disease. Overall, the frequency of early transcript detection varied from 45% to 90% and tended to increase with lesion severity. In addition, the levels of E2, E5, and E6 transcript expression were slightly higher in high-grade lesions than in cervical specimens without abnormalities. Notably, early transcript expression was clearly associated with viral load, and no inverse correlation was found between the expression of E2 and E6 transcripts. No clear association was found between early transcript expression and HPV16 DNA integration, with the exception that samples with a fully integrated HPV16 genome did not harbor E2 or E5 transcripts. In conclusion, early HPV16 transcript expression appears to be associated with viral load rather than lesion grade. From a practical point of view, quantification of HPV16 early transcripts is difficult to translate into a relevant biomarker for cervical cancer screening."
39220653,Influence of diabetes on microbiome in prostate tissues of patients with prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Although microbiota in prostatic tissues of patients with prostate cancer have been studied, results of different studies have been inconsistent. Different ethnicity of study subjects, different study designs, and potential contaminations during sample collection and experiments might have influenced microbiome results of prostatic tissues. In this study, we analyzed microbiota and their potential functions in benign and malignant tissues of prostate cancer considering possible contaminants and host variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 118 tissue samples (59 benign tissues and 59 malignant tissues) obtained by robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were analyzed and 64 negative controls (from sampling to sequencing processes) were included to reduce potential contaminants. RESULTS: Alteration of the microbiome in prostate tissues was detected only in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, the influence of diabetes on microbiome was significant in malignant tissues. The microbiome in malignant tissues of patients with diabetes was influenced by pathologic stages. The relative abundance of Cutibacterium was reduced in the high pathologic group compared to that in the intermediate group. This reduction was related to microbial pathways increased in the high pathologic group. CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicate that diabetes can influence the progression of prostate cancer with microbiome alteration in prostate tissues. Although further studies are necessary to confirm findings of this study, this study can help us understand tissue microbiome in prostate cancer and improve clinical therapy strategies."
39217195,Altered expression of vesicular trafficking machinery in prostate cancer affects lysosomal dynamics and provides insight into the underlying biology and disease progression.,"BACKGROUND: This study focuses on the role of lysosomal trafficking in prostate cancer, given the essential role of lysosomes in cellular homoeostasis. METHODS: Lysosomal motility was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy of LAMP-1-transfected prostate cells and spot-tracking analysis. Expression of lysosomal trafficking machinery was evaluated in patient cohort databases and through immunohistochemistry on tumour samples. The roles of vesicular trafficking machinery were evaluated through over-expression and siRNA. The effects of R1881 treatment on lysosome vesicular trafficking was evaluated by RNA sequencing, protein quantification and fixed- and live-cell microscopy. RESULTS: Altered regulation of lysosomal trafficking genes/proteins was observed in prostate cancer tissue, with significant correlations for co-expression of vesicular trafficking machinery in Gleason patterns. The expression of trafficking machinery was associated with poorer patient outcomes. R1881 treatment induced changes in lysosomal distribution, number, and expression of lysosomal vesicular trafficking machinery in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Manipulation of genes involved in lysosomal trafficking events induced changes in lysosome positioning and cell phenotype, as well as differential effects on cell migration, in non-malignant and prostate cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the altered regulation and functional impact of lysosomal vesicular trafficking in prostate cancer pathogenesis."
39215860,Transcriptional expression of SLC16A7 as a biomarker of occult lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: Glucose is the main energy substrate of tumor cells. This study aims to assess whether the transcriptional expression of glucose metabolism-related genes is associated with occult lymph node metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. METHODS: We examined the transcriptional expression of a panel of glucose metabolism-related genes in a cohort of 53 patients with HNSCC without cervical lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis (cN0) and subsequently treated with elective neck dissection. RESULTS: Occult lymph node metastases were found in 37.7% (n = 20) of the patients. Among the analyzed genes, SLC16A7 exhibited the strongest association with the presence of occult lymph node metastases. Patients with occult lymph node metastases (cN0/pN +) had significantly lower SLC16A7 expression values (p = 0.001). Patients with low SLC16A7 expression (n = 17, 32.1%) had a frequency of occult lymph node metastases of 76.5%, while for patients with high SLCA16A7 expression (n = 36, 67.9%) it was 19.4% (P = 0.0001). A multivariable analysis showed that patients with low expression of SLC16A7 had a 12.6 times higher risk of developing occult lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: cN0 HNSCC patients with low SLC16A7 expression had a higher risk of occult lymph node metastases."
39215044,Tumor-agnostic cancer therapy using antibodies targeting oncofetal chondroitin sulfate.,"Molecular similarities between embryonic and malignant cells can be exploited to target tumors through specific signatures absent in healthy adult tissues. One such embryonic signature tumors express is oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS), which supports disease progression and dissemination in cancer. Here, we report the identification and characterization of phage display-derived antibody fragments recognizing two distinct ofCS epitopes. These antibody fragments show binding affinity to ofCS in the low nanomolar range across a broad selection of solid tumor types in vitro and in vivo with minimal binding to normal, inflamed, or benign tumor tissues. Anti-ofCS antibody drug conjugates and bispecific immune cell engagers based on these targeting moieties disrupt tumor progression in animal models of human and murine cancers. Thus, anti-ofCS antibody fragments hold promise for the development of broadly effective therapeutic and diagnostic applications targeting human malignancies."
39212392,[Inflammatory factors and prostate cancer: Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis].,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential causal relationship between inflammatory factors and PCa using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. METHODS: We selected summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 14 824) on 91 inflammatory factors, with PCa as the outcome in the latest 9th edition of FinnGen database for MR analysis. We evaluated the causal relationship between inflammatory factors and PCa using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of such regression models as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger regression, simple mode (SM), weighted mode (WM) and weighted median estimator (WME), with IVW as the main statistical method for this study. We further verified the results of MR by Bayesian analysis, and evaluated the heterogeneity of genetic instrumental variables, pleiotropic effects and sensitivity of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) as instrumental variables to the exposure-outcome relationship by Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test and leave-one-out cross validation. RESULTS: IVW showed that among the 91 inflammatory factors, interleukin-22 receptor A1 (IL-22RA1) and sulfotransferase 1A1 (ST1A1) were correlated positively with the risk of PCa； IL-22RA1：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 1.12 ［1.00－1.25］, P = 0.04）；ST1A1：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 1.08 (1.00－1.16), P = 0. 03）, while Chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11) and interleukin 17 A (IL-17 A) negatively with the risk of PCa； CXCL11：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 0.88 ［0.81－0.95］, P = 0.00）；IL-17A：IVW（OR ［95% CI］: 0.91 ［0.84－0.98］, P = 0.02）. No potential horizontal pleiotropy was detected by MR-Egger intercept analysis (P > 0.05, IL-22RA1 = 0.885, ST1A1 = 0.949, CXCL11 = 0.391, IL-17A = 0.884), nor biased SNPs in the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test (P > 0.05, IL-22RA1 = 0.479, ST1A1 = 0.629, CXCL11 = 0.326, IL-17A = 0.444), or heterogeneity P > 0.05, IL-22RA1 = 0.543, ST1A1 = 0.677, CXCL11 = 0.336, IL-17A = 0.494). Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis indicated no significant impact of individual SNP sites on the overall causal relationship prediction, suggesting the reliable results of analysis. CONCLUSION: Among the 91 inflammatory factors, IL-22RA1 and ST1A1 have a positive causal relationship, while CXCL11 and IL-17A have a negative causal relationship with PCa."
39212345,Early circulating tumor DNA changes predict outcomes in head and neck cancer patients under re-radiotherapy.,"Local recurrence after radiotherapy is common in locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Re-irradiation can improve local disease control, but disease progression remains frequent. Hence, predictive biomarkers are needed to adapt treatment intensity to the patient's individual risk. We quantified circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in sequential plasma samples and correlated ctDNA levels with disease outcome. Ninety four longitudinal plasma samples from 16 locally advanced HNC patients and 57 healthy donors were collected at re-radiotherapy baseline, after 5 and 10 radiation fractions, at irradiation end, and at routine follow-up visits. Plasma DNA was subjected to low coverage whole genome sequencing for copy number variation (CNV) profiling to quantify ctDNA burden. CNV-based ctDNA burden was detected in 8/16 patients and 25/94 plasma samples. Ten additional ctDNA-positive samples were identified by tracking patient-specific CNVs found in earlier sequential plasma samples. ctDNA-positivity after 5 and 10 radiation fractions (both: log-rank, p = .050) as well as at the end of irradiation correlated with short progression-free survival (log-rank, p = .006). Moreover, a pronounced decrease of ctDNA toward re-radiotherapy termination was associated with worse treatment outcome (log-rank, p = .005). Dynamic ctDNA tracking in serial plasma beyond re-radiotherapy reflected treatment response and imminent disease progression. In five patients, molecular progression was detected prior to tumor progression based on clinical imaging. Our findings emphasize that quantifying ctDNA during re-radiotherapy may contribute to disease monitoring and personalization of adjuvant treatment, follow-up intervals, and dose prescription."
39210559,Talazoparib for the treatment of prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Around 25% of patients with advanced prostate cancer harbor alterations in the homologous recombination/DNA damage repair (HRR) pathway. Inhibiting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in these patients leads to synthetic lethality, making PARP inhibitors (PARPi), including talazoparib, a promising treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and potentially for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). AREAS COVERED: This article examines the mechanism of action, chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical safety and efficacy data of different PARPis, including talazoparib in prostate cancer. It reviews the TALAPRO-1 and TALAPRO-2 clinical trials and the ongoing TALAPRO-3 trial. EXPERT OPINION: Despite recent therapeutic advancements, mCRPC remains a lethal disease. Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) are approved for patients with mCRPC and mHSPC, yet most patients first receive these agents in the castration-resistant setting. Real-world data indicate that around half of patients with mCRPC do not receive subsequent lines of therapy, underscoring the efficacy of upfront combination therapies. The combinations of ARPI plus PARPi are indicated for patients with mCRPC harboring HRR mutations, though identifying these patients is challenging due to limited genomic testing. Further research and improved access to genomic testing are essential to optimize treatment strategies."
39210444,Biological and clinical relevance of correlated expression levels of coding and long noncoding RNAs in HPV16 positive cervical cancers.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) drives cervical cancer (CaCx) pathogenesis and viral oncoproteins jeopardize global gene expression in such cancers. In this study, our aim was to identify differentially expressed coding (DEcGs) and long noncoding RNA genes (DElncGs) specifically sense intronic and Natural Antisense Transcripts as they are located in the genic regions and may have a direct influence on the expression pattern of their neighbouring coding genes. We compared HPV16-positive CaCx patients (N = 44) with HPV-negative normal individuals (N = 34) by employing strand-specific RNA-seq and determined the relationships between DEcGs and DElncGs and their clinical implications. By performing Gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses of DEcGs, we identified enrichment of processes crucial for abortive virus life cycle and cancer progression. The DEcGs formed 16 gene clusters which we identified through Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin of Cytoscape. All the gene clusters portrayed cancer-related functions. We recorded significantly correlated expression levels of 79 DElncGs with DEcGs at proximal genomic loci based on Pearson's Correlation coefficients. Of these gene pairs, 24 pairs portrayed significantly altered correlation coefficients among patients, compared to normal individuals. Of these, 6 DEcGs of 6 such gene pairs, belonged to 5 of the identified gene clusters, one of which was survival-associated. Out of the 24 correlated DEcG: DElncG pairs, we identified 3 pairs, where expression of both members was significantly associated with patient overall survival. The findings justify the cooperative roles of these gene pairs, in patient prognostication, thereby bearing immense potential for translation. Thus, elucidation of correlative strengths between paired DElncGs and DEcGs in patient and normal samples, could serve as a foundation for identification of therapeutic and prognostic targets of HPV16-positive CaCx."
39209455,Identification of Siglec-10 as a new dendritic cell checkpoint for cervical cancer immunotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: The occurrence of chronic inflammation resulting from infection with human papillomaviruses is an important factor in the development of cervical cancer (CC); thus, deciphering the crosstalk between the tumor microenvironment and innate immune cells during the establishment of immune tolerance is vital for identifying potential treatment strategies. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data and primary tumor samples from patients with CC were used to evaluate the functional role of Siglec-10 on dendritic cells (DCs). Patient-derived tumor fragment platforms were used to examine the ability of Siglec-10 blockade to reinvigorate DC-mediate T-cell activation and tumor clearance. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that Siglec-10 is a prominent inhibitory checkpoint for DCs infiltrated in CC. CC epithelial cells use their aberrant surface sialylated structures to induce the transformation of conventional DCs into phenotypes characterized by low immunogenicity and high immunotolerance. Additionally, Siglec-10(+) DCs suppress the function of adaptive T cells via galectin-9 signaling to strengthen the immunosuppressive CC microenvironment. Disturbance of Siglec-10 signaling restored the DC-mediated tumoricidal response and increased adaptive T cells sensitivity to programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the checkpoint role of Siglec-10 on DCs and proposes that targeting Siglec-10 may be a promising avenue for immunotherapy against CC."
39208374,A Targeted Methylation-Based Multicancer Early Detection Blood Test Preferentially Detects High-Grade Prostate Cancer While Minimizing Overdiagnosis of Indolent Disease.,"PURPOSE: Indolent prostate cancer (PCa) is prevalent in the intended use population (adults age 50-79 years) for blood-based multicancer early detection (MCED) tests. We examined the detectability of PCa by a clinically validated, targeted methylation-based MCED test. METHODS: Detectability by Gleason grade group (GG), clinical stage, association of detection status with tumor methylated fraction (TMeF), and overall survival (OS) were assessed in substudy 3 of Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas (CCGA; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02889978) and PATHFINDER (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04241796) studies. RESULTS: Test sensitivity for PCa in substudy 3 of CCGA was 11.2% (47/420). The test detected 0 (0%) of 58 low-grade (GG1), 3 (1.9%) of 157 favorable intermediate-grade (GG2), 4 (5.1%) of 78 unfavorable intermediate-grade (GG3), and 36 (31.9%) of 113 high-grade (GG4 and 5) cancers and 3 (3.2%) of 95 stage I, 11 (4.7%) of 235 stage II, 7 (14.9%) of 47 stage III, and 22 (81.5%) of 27 stage IV cases. The median TMeF was higher for detected than nondetected cases (2,106.0 parts per million [PPM]; IQR, 349.8-24,376.3 v 24.4 PPM; IQR, 17.8-38.5; P < .05). Nondetected cases had better OS (P < .05; hazard ratio [HR], 0.263 [95% CI, 0.104 to 0.533]) and detected cases had similar survival (P = .2; HR, 0.672 [95% CI, 0.323 to 1.21]) compared with SEER adjusted for age, GG, and stage. Performance was similar in PATHFINDER, with no detected GG1/2 (0/13) or stage I/II (0/16) cases. CONCLUSION: This MCED test preferentially detects high-grade, clinically significant PCa. Use in population-based screening programs in addition to standard-of-care screening is unlikely to exacerbate overdiagnosis of indolent PCa."
39208235,"Bioinformatics analysis to identify the relationship between human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer, toll-like receptors and exomes: A genetic epidemiology study.","INTRODUCTION: Genetic variants may influence Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and lead to cervical cancer. In this study, we investigated the pattern of TLR expression in the transcriptome of HPV-positive and HPV-negative cervical cancer samples and looked for variants potentially related to TLR gene alterations in exomes from different populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cervical tissue sample from 28 women, which was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, was used to examine TLR gene expression. Subsequently, the transcripts related to the TLRs that showed significant gene expression were queried in the Genome Aggregation Database to search for variants in more than 5,728 exomes from different ethnicities. RESULTS: Cancer and HPV were found to be associated (p<0.0001). TLR1(p = 0.001), TLR3(p = 0.004), TLR4(221060_s_at)(p = 0.001), TLR7(p = 0.001;p = 0.047), TLR8(p = 0.002) and TLR10(p = 0.008) were negatively regulated, while TLR4(1552798_at)(p<0.0001) and TLR6(p = 0.019) were positively regulated in HPV-positive patients (p<0.05). The clinical significance of the variants was statistically significant for TLR1, TLR3, TLR6 and TLR8 in association with ethnicity. Genetic variants in different TLRs have been found in various ethnic populations. Variants of the TLR gene were of the following types: TLR1(5_prime_UTR), TLR4(start_lost), TLR8(synonymous;missense) and TLR10(3_prime_UTR). The ""missense"" variant was found to have a risk of its clinical significance being pathogenic in South Asian populations (OR = 56,820[95%CI:40,206,80,299]). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the variants found in the transcriptomes of different populations may lead to impairment of the functional aspect of TLRs that show significant gene expression in cervical cancer samples caused by HPV."
39207857,"Androgen production, uptake, and conversion (APUC) genes define prostate cancer patients with distinct clinical outcomes.","BACKGROUNDProstate cancer (PC) is driven by aberrant signaling of the androgen receptor (AR) or its ligands, and androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs) are a cornerstone of treatment. ADT responsiveness may be associated with germline changes in genes that regulate androgen production, uptake, and conversion (APUC).METHODSWe analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data from prostate tissues (SU2C/PCF, TCGA, GETx). We also interrogated the Caris Precision Oncology Alliance (POA) DNA (592-gene/whole exome) and RNA (whole transcriptome) next-generation sequencing databases. Algorithm for Linking Activity Networks (ALAN) was used to quantify all pairwise gene-to-gene associations. Real-world overall survival was determined from insurance claims data using Kaplan-Meier estimates.RESULTSSix APUC genes (HSD3B1, HSD3B2, CYP3A43, CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP17A1) exhibited coalescent gene behavior in a cohort of metastatic tumors (n = 208). In the Caris POA dataset, the 6 APUC genes (APUC-6) exhibited robust clustering in primary prostate (n = 4,490) and metastatic (n = 2,593) biopsies. Surprisingly, tumors with elevated APUC-6 expression had statically lower expression of AR, AR-V7, and AR signaling scores, suggesting ligand-driven disease biology. APUC-6 genes instead associated with the expression of alternative steroid hormone receptors, ESR1/2 and PGR. We used RNA expression of AR or APUC-6 genes to define 2 subgroups of tumors with differential association with hallmark pathways and cell surface targets.CONCLUSIONSThe APUC-6-high/AR-low tumors represented a subgroup of patients with good clinical outcomes, in contrast with the AR-high or neuroendocrine PCs. Altogether, measuring the aggregate expression of APUC-6 genes in current genomic tests identifies PCs that are ligand (rather than AR) driven and require distinct therapeutic strategies.FUNDINGNCI/NIH 1R37CA288972-01, NCI Cancer Center Support P30 CA077598, DOD W81XWH-22-2-0025, R01 CA249279."
39206965,Integrating Single-Cell RNA-Seq and Bulk RNA-Seq to Construct a Novel gammadeltaT Cell-Related Prognostic Signature for Human Papillomavirus-Infected Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells play dual roles in human tumors, with both antitumor and tumor-promoting functions. However, the role of gammadeltaT cells in HPV-infected cervical cancer is still undetermined. Therefore, we aimed to identify gammadeltaT cell-related prognostic signatures in the cervical tumor microenvironment. METHODS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, bulk RNA-seq data, and corresponding clinical information of cervical cancer patients were obtained from the TCGA and GEO databases. The Seurat R package was used for single-cell analysis, and machine learning algorithms were used to screen and construct a gammadeltaT cell-related prognostic signature. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect the expression of prognostic signature genes. RESULTS: Single-cell analysis indicated distinct populations of gammadeltaT cells between HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV-) cervical cancers. A trajectory analysis indicated gammadeltaT cells clustered into differential clusters with the pseudotime. High-dimensional Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (hdWGCNA) identified the key gammadeltaT cell-related gene modules. Bulk RNA-seq analysis also demonstrated the heterogeneity of immune cells, and the gammadeltaT-score was positively associated with inflammatory response and negatively associated with MYC stemness. Eight gammadeltaT cell-related hub genes (GTRGs), including ITGAE, IKZF3, LSP1, NEDD9, CLEC2D, RBPJ, TRBC2, and OXNAD1, were selected and validated as a prognostic signature for cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: We identified gammadeltaT cell-related prognostic signatures that can be considered independent factors for survival prediction in cervical cancer."
39201599,Molecular Alterations Associated with Histologically Overt Stromal Response in Patients with Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer has substantial heterogeneity in clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses, posing challenges in predicting disease progression and tailoring treatment strategies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential prognostic value of evaluating the tumor microenvironment, including the presence of a histologically overt stromal response (HOST-response) characterized by peri-glandular stromal changes and architectural distortions. This retrospective study examined patient records from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genomic alterations associated with the HOST-response in prostate cancer. Among 348 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 160 (45.98%) were identified as having a HOST-response. A gene expression analysis revealed 1263 genes with significantly higher expression in patients with a HOST-response. A protein-protein interaction network analysis identified seven hub genes (KIF2C, CENPA, CDC20, UBE2C, ESPL1, KIF23, and PLK1) highly interconnected in the network. A functional enrichment analysis revealed alterations in the cell division, cytoskeletal organization, cytokinesis, and interleukin-16 signaling pathways in patients with a HOST-response, suggesting dysregulated proliferation and inflammation. The distinct molecular signature associated with the HOST-response provides insights into the tumor-stroma interactions driving adverse outcomes and potential targets for tailored therapeutic interventions in this subset of patients with prostate cancer."
39201281,Liquid Biopsy in the Clinical Management of Cancers.,"Liquid biopsy, a noninvasive diagnosis that examines circulating tumor components in body fluids, is increasingly used in cancer management. An overview of relevant literature emphasizes the current state of liquid biopsy applications in cancer care. Biomarkers in liquid biopsy, particularly circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor RNAs (ctRNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and other components, offer promising opportunities for early cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, monitoring, and disease assessment. The implementation of liquid biopsy in precision medicine has shown significant potential in various cancer types, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Advances in genomic and molecular technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) have expanded the utility of liquid biopsy, enabling the detection of somatic variants and actionable genomic alterations in tumors. Liquid biopsy has also demonstrated utility in predicting treatment responses, monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD), and assessing tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, standardizing liquid biopsy techniques, interpreting results, and integrating them into the clinical routine remain as challenges. Despite these challenges, liquid biopsy has significant clinical implications in cancer management, offering a dynamic and noninvasive approach to understanding tumor biology and guiding personalized treatment strategies."
39199664,Implication of Capillary Morphogenesis Gene 2 (CMG2) in the Disease Progression and Peritoneal Metastasis of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) mediates cell-matrix interactions to facilitate cell adhesion and migration. CMG2 has been implicated in the disease progression of breast cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer. The present study aims to determine the role of CMG2 in the disease progression and peritoneal metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic tumour samples were collected from Peking University Cancer Hospital. CMG2 expression was determined using quantitative PCR. After the creation of knockdown and overexpression of CMG2 in pancreatic cancer cells, the effect of CMG2 on several cell functions and adhesion to the peritoneum was examined. Potential pathways regulated by CMG2 were found via proteomics analysis and drug tests. CMG2 was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and associated with a poor prognosis. CMG2 was increased in metastatic lesions and those primary tumours with distant metastases. CMG2 promotes cell-cell, cell-matrix and cell-hyaluronic acid adhesion, which may be mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation."
39199648,Usefulness of Tissue Biomarkers versus Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Positron Emission Tomography for Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy.,"Despite curative-intent local therapy, approximately 27% to 53% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence, known as biochemical recurrence (BCR). BCR significantly raises the risk of PCa-related morbidity and mortality, yet there is no consensus on optimal management. Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA PET) has emerged as highly sensitive imaging, distinguishing local recurrences from distant metastases, crucially influencing treatment decisions. Genomic biomarkers such as Decipher, Prolaris, and Oncotype DX contribute to refining recurrence risk profiles, guiding decisions on intensifying adjuvant therapies, like radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This review assesses PSMA PET and biomarker utility in post-radical prostatectomy BCR scenarios, highlighting their impact on clinical decision-making. Despite their promising roles, the routine integration of biomarkers is limited by availability and cost, requiring further evidence. PSMA PET remains indispensable for restaging and treatment evaluation in these patients. Integrating biomarkers and PSMA PET promises to optimize personalized management strategies for BCR, though more comprehensive consensus-building studies are needed to define their standardized utility in clinical practice."
39199249,Sodium Selenite Induces Autophagy and Apoptosis in Cervical Cancer Cells via Mitochondrial ROS-Activated AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a Pathway.,"Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element known for its significant role in maintaining human health and mitigating disease progression. Selenium and its compounds exhibit high selective cytotoxicity against tumor cells. However, their anti-cervical cancer (CC) effects and underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. This study found that sodium selenite (SS) inhibits the viability of HeLa and SiHa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal injection of 3 and 6 mg/kg SS for 14 days in female nude mice significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa cell xenografts without evident hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity. RNA sequencing results indicated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Forkhead box protein O (FOXO), and apoptosis signaling pathways are key regulatory pathways in SS's anti-CC effects, and SS's inhibition of HeLa cell proliferation may be related to autophagy and ROS-induced apoptosis. Further research has revealed that SS induces cell autophagy and apoptosis through the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a pathway, characterized by the upregulation of p-AMPK/AMPK, FOXO3a, LC3-II, cleaved-caspase3, and cleaved-PARP and the downregulation of p-mTOR/mTOR and p62. Additionally, SS impaired mitochondrial function, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, and accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Pretreatment with Mitoquinone mesylate (Mito Q) and compound C partially reversed SS-induced apoptosis, autophagy, and proliferation inhibition. Pretreatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhances SS-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in HeLa cells but reverses these effects in SiHa cells. In summary, SS induces apoptosis, autophagy, and proliferation inhibition in HeLa and SiHa cells through the activation of the AMPK/mTOR/FOXO3a signaling pathway via mtROS. Autophagy activation may be a major risk factor for SS-induced apoptosis in SiHa cells but can protect HeLa cells from SS-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new evidence for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SS in potential new drug development for CC."
39199148,The Influence of beta-Carotene and Its Liposomal Form on the Expression of EMT Markers and Androgen-Dependent Pathways in Different Prostate Cell Lines.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men. Although the prognosis in the early stages is good, the treatment of advanced PCa remains a formidable challenge. Even after an initial response to hormone therapy or chemotherapy, recurrences are frequent and resistance to any systemic treatment is common. beta-Carotene (BC), a plant-derived tetraterpene, is known for its antioxidant capacity and can modulate multiple cellular signaling pathways, potentially affecting androgen synthesis. We investigated the influence of BC (dissolved in EtOH/THF with a cell culture medium or encapsulated in liposomes (LP-BCs)) on the viability, migration potential, and connective tissue cleavage capabilities of several PCa cell lines (Du145, LNCaP, PC-3, and 22Rv1) and a healthy prostate model (RWPE cells). BC significantly reduced the proliferative capacity of all investigated cell lines at various concentrations (1.5-30 microM) and decreased cell migration. However, it significantly increased the expression of epidermal-mesenchymal transition (EMT) master proteins in all cancer cell lines and RWPE (p < 0.05) These effects were not observed with LP-BCs. This study suggests that LP-BCs, with their higher antiproliferative capabilities and pronounced inhibition of the EMT, may be a more effective form of possible PCa prevention or treatment than the free form. LPs may also modulate lipid metabolism in PCa cells."
39198848,Large-scale copy number alterations are enriched for synthetic viability in BRCA1/BRCA2 tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations contribute to hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Paradoxically, bi-allelic inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (bBRCA1/2) is embryonically lethal and decreases cellular proliferation. The compensatory mechanisms that facilitate oncogenesis in bBRCA1/2 tumors remain unclear. METHODS: We identified recurrent genetic alterations enriched in human bBRCA1/2 tumors and experimentally validated if these improved proliferation in cellular models. We analyzed mutations and copy number alterations (CNAs) in bBRCA1/2 breast and ovarian cancer from the TCGA and ICGC. We used Fisher's exact test to identify CNAs enriched in bBRCA1/2 tumors compared to control tumors that lacked evidence of homologous recombination deficiency. Genes located in CNA regions enriched in bBRCA1/2 tumors were further screened by gene expression and their effects on proliferation in genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens. A set of candidate genes was functionally validated with in vitro clonogenic survival and functional assays to validate their influence on proliferation in the setting of bBRCA1/2 mutations. RESULTS: We found that bBRCA1/2 tumors harbor recurrent large-scale genomic deletions significantly more frequently than histologically matched controls (n = 238 cytobands in breast and ovarian cancers). Within the deleted regions, we identified 277 BRCA1-related genes and 218 BRCA2-related genes that had reduced expression and increased proliferation in bBRCA1/2 but not in wild-type cells in genome-wide CRISPR screens. In vitro validation of 20 candidate genes with clonogenic proliferation assays validated 9 genes, including RIC8A and ATMIN (ATM-Interacting protein). We identified loss of RIC8A, which occurs frequently in both bBRCA1/2 tumors and is synthetically viable with loss of both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Furthermore, we found that metastatic homologous recombination deficient cancers acquire loss-of-function mutations in RIC8A. Lastly, we identified that RIC8A does not rescue homologous recombination deficiency but may influence mitosis in bBRCA1/2 tumors, potentially leading to increased micronuclei formation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a means to solve the tumor suppressor paradox by identifying synthetic viability interactions and causal driver genes affected by large-scale CNAs in human cancers."
39198404,Convergent alterations in the tumor microenvironment of MYC-driven human and murine prostate cancer.,"How prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to drive prostate cancer progression is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we perform extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key stages in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues reveal that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling is a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Cell communication network and pathway analyses in GEMMs show that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogram the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to a convergence of cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that parallel key findings in human prostate cancer."
39196719,"Associations Between Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Genomic Testing, and Treatment for Localized Prostate Cancer.","INTRODUCTION: Although prostate MRI and tissue-based gene expression (genomic) tests improve staging and estimates of prostate cancer prognosis, their association with the intensity of treatment patients receive is not well understood. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer in 2013 through 2017 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The primary study outcome was the receipt of treatment intensification in the first 12 months after diagnosis (defined as the addition of androgen deprivation therapy among patients receiving radiation or pelvic lymphadenectomy among those undergoing radical prostatectomy). We assessed associations between the receipt of prostate MRI and genomic testing and treatment intensification, adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors and further stratifying the analyses by risk status. RESULTS: We identified 37,064 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, including 6398, 22,011, and 5976 with low, intermediate, and high D'Amico-risk disease, respectively. Among all treated patients, receipt of prostate MRI was associated with increased odds of treatment intensification (odds ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.65-1.88, P < .001). In contrast, genomic testing was not significantly associated. Among treated patients with high-risk disease, genomic testing was associated with decreased odds of intensified treatment (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Prostate MRI was associated with intensified treatment across risk strata, while genomic testing was associated with lower intensity of treatment among high-risk disease. Additional study is needed to determine whether use of imaging and risk stratification tools leads to improved long-term patient outcomes."
39196408,Genomic landscape of early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma in Mexican patients: an exploratory study.,"BACKGROUND: Health disparities have been highlighted among patient with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) due to ethnicity. Mexican men present a more aggressive disease than other patients resulting in less favorable treatment outcome. We aimed to identify the mutational landscape which could help to reduce the health disparities among minority groups and generate the first genomics exploratory study of PRAD in Mexican patients. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tumoral tissue from 20 Mexican patients with early-stage PRAD treated at The Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Mexico City from 2017 to 2019 were analyzed. Tumoral DNA was prepared for whole exome sequencing, the resulting files were mapped against h19 using BWA-MEM. Strelka2 and Lancet packages were used to identify single nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertions or deletions. FACETS was used to determine somatic copy number alterations (SCNA). Cancer Genome Interpreter web interface was used to determine the clinical relevance of variants. RESULTS: Patients were in an early clinical stage and had a mean age of 59.55 years (standard deviation [SD]: 7.1 years) with 90% of them having a Gleason Score of 7. Follow-up time was 48.50 months (SD: 32.77) with recurrences and progression in 30% and 15% of the patients, respectively. NUP98 (20%), CSMD3 (15%) and FAT1 (15%) were the genes most frequently affected by SNV; ARAF (75%) and ZNF419 (70%) were the most frequently affected by losses and gains SNCA's. One quarter of the patients had mutations useful as biomarkers for the use of PARP inhibitors, they comprise mutations in BRCA, RAD54L and ATM. SBS05, DBS03 and ID08 were the most common mutational signatures present in this cohort. No associations with recurrence or progression were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study reveals the mutational landscape of early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma in Mexican men, providing a first approach to understand the mutational patterns and actionable mutations in early prostate cancer can inform personalized treatment approaches and reduce the underrepresentation in genomic cancer studies."
39196362,ERBB2/ ERBB3-mutated S100/ SOX10-positive unclassified high-grade uterine sarcoma: first detailed description of a novel entity.,"With the increasing use of innovative next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms in routine diagnostic and research settings, the genetic landscape of uterine sarcomas has been dynamically evolving during the last two decades. Notably, the majority of recently recognized genotypes in uterine sarcomas represent gene fusions, while recurrent oncogene mutations of diagnostic and/ or therapeutic value have been rare. Recently, a distinctive aggressive uterine sarcoma expressing S100 and SOX10, but otherwise lacking diagnostic morphological, immunophenotypic and molecular features of other uterine malignancies has been presented in a scientific abstract form (USCAP, 2023), but detailed description and delineation of the entity is still missing. We herein describe two high-grade unclassified uterine sarcomas characterized by spindle to round cell morphology and diffuse expression of S100 and SOX10, originating in the uterine body and cervix of 53- and 45-year-old women and carrying an ERBB3 (p.Glu928Gly) and an ERBB2 (p.Val777Leu) mutation, respectively. Both tumors harbored in addition genomic HER2 amplification, ATRX mutation and CDKN2A deletion. Methylation studies revealed a methylome most similar to MPNST-like tumors, but distinct from melanoma, MPNST, clear cell sarcoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma. Case 1 died of progressive peritoneal metastases after multiple trials of chemotherapy 47 months after diagnosis. Case 2 is a recent case who presented with a cervical mass, which was biopsied. This study defines a novel heretofore unrecognized aggressive uterine sarcoma with unique phenotypic and genotypic features. Given the potential value of targeting HER2, recognizing this tumor type is mandatory for appropriate therapeutic strategies and for better future delineation of the entity."
39194246,Human papillomavirus 16 replication converts SAMHD1 into a homologous recombination factor and promotes its recruitment to replicating viral DNA.,"We have demonstrated that SAMHD1 (sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic domain HD-containing protein 1) is a restriction factor for the human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) life cycle. Here, we demonstrate that in HPV-negative cervical cancer C33a cells and human foreskin keratinocytes immortalized by HPV16 (HFK+HPV16), SAMHD1 is recruited to E1-E2 replicating DNA. Homologous recombination (HR) factors are required for HPV16 replication, and viral replication promotes phosphorylation of SAMHD1, which converts it from a dNTPase to an HR factor independent from E6/E7 expression. A SAMHD1 phospho-mimic (SAMHD1 T592D) reduces E1-E2-mediated DNA replication in C33a cells and has enhanced recruitment to the replicating DNA. In HFK+HPV16 cells, SAMHD1 T592D is recruited to the viral DNA and attenuates cellular growth, but does not attenuate growth in isogenic HFK cells immortalized by E6/E7 alone. SAMHD1 T592D also attenuates the development of viral replication foci following keratinocyte differentiation. The results indicated that enhanced SAMHD1 phosphorylation could be therapeutically beneficial in cells with HPV16 replicating genomes. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can dephosphorylate SAMHD1, and PP2A function can be inhibited by endothall. We demonstrate that endothall reduces E1-E2 replication and promotes SAMHD1 recruitment to E1-E2 replicating DNA, mimicking the SAMHD1 T592D phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate that in head and neck cancer cell lines with HPV16 episomal genomes, endothall attenuates their growth and promotes recruitment of SAMHD1 to the viral genome. The results suggest that targeting cellular phosphatases has therapeutic potential for the treatment of HPV infections and cancers. IMPORTANCE: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causative agents in around 5% of all human cancers. The development of anti-viral therapeutics depends upon an increased understanding of the viral life cycle. Here, we demonstrate that HPV16 replication converts sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic domain HD-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) into a homologous recombination (HR) factor via phosphorylation. This phosphorylation promotes recruitment of SAMHD1 to viral DNA to assist with replication. A SAMHD1 mutant that mimics phosphorylation is hyper-recruited to viral DNA and attenuates viral replication. Expression of this mutant in HPV16-immortalized cells attenuates the growth of these cells, but not cells immortalized by the viral oncogenes E6/E7 alone. Finally, we demonstrate that the phosphatase inhibitor endothall promotes hyper-recruitment of endogenous SAMHD1 to HPV16 replicating DNA and can attenuate the growth of both HPV16-immortalized human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) and HPV16-positive head and neck cancer cell lines. We propose that phosphatase inhibitors represent a novel tool for combating HPV infections and disease."
39193365,Deciphering the divergent transcriptomic landscapes of cervical cancer cells grown in 3D and 2D cell culture systems.,"Cervical cancer remains a significant health challenge for women worldwide, with a disproportionate impact on developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa. Taking advantage of recent advancements in developing suitable preclinical models to study cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression, we used RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptomic profiles of SiHa cervical cancer cells grown in 3D versus 2D culture systems. Pathway analysis of 3D cultures revealed upregulation of immune activation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling pathways. The high expression of cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and immediate early genes, suggests that 3D cultures replicate the tumor microenvironment better than 2D monolayer cultures. HPV gene expression analysis further demonstrated higher expression levels of HPV16 E1, E2, E6, and E7 genes in 3D versus 2D cultures. Further, by using a set of linear models, we identified 79 significantly differentially expressed genes in 3D culture compared to 2D culture conditions, independent of HPV16 viral gene effects. We subsequently validated five of these genes at the protein level in both the SiHa cell line and a newly developed, patient-derived cervical cancer cell line. In addition, correlation analysis identified 26 human genes positively correlated with viral genes across 2D and 3D culture conditions. The top five 3D versus 2D differentially expressed and HPV-correlated genes were validated via qRT-PCR in our patient derived cell line. Altogether, these findings suggest that 3D cultures provide superior model systems to explore mechanisms of immune evasion, cancer progression and antiviral therapeutics."
39192650,Single-cell RNA-sequencing Analysis Reveals the Promoting Role of the Hedgehog Pathway in Epithelial Cells during Cervical Cancer Progression.,"AIM: This study explored the role of the Hedgehog pathway in epithelial cells during cervical cancer [CC] progression, providing new insights for improving current CC treatment. BACKGROUND: Abnormal activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway is associated with the malignant transformation of CC epithelial cells. Single-cell atlas of CC and the role of Hedgehog pathway in epithelial cells during CC progression remain to be explored. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively analyze the mechanism of Hedgehog pathway activation in CC epithelial cells and its impact on tumor progression by applying single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq] analysis. METHODS: The scRNA-seq data were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] database and then processed with the Seurat package. FindNeighbors and Find- Clusters functions were applied to cluster the cells. The CellMarker database was used for subgroup annotation. Differentially expressed genes [DEGs] in each cell subgroup were filtered by FindAllMarkers function. Biological function analysis for the gene set of interest was performed using Clusterprofiler package. AUCell function was employed to calculate the score of the Hedgehog pathway. The differentiation trajectory in epithelial cell subtypes was generated by performing Pseudotime analysis. Finally, protein-protein network [PPI] was used to investigate the interactions between the Hedgehog pathway and other pathways enriched in the gene set of interest. RESULTS: A total of 9 major cell subpopulations were classified and the proportion of epithelial cells was the highest in CC samples. Further analysis revealed that the Hedgehog pathway was abnormally activated in STYK1+ and TP73+ epithelial cell subtypes. Pseudo-time trajectory analysis showed that the differentiation trajectory of STYK1+ epithelial cells gradually transformed into defense-to-virus cells or into proliferation cells, while TP73+ epithelial cells eventually differentiated into two branches of response to estrogen and virus-induced proliferation. PPI analysis showed that the Hedgehog pathway was involved in the proliferation and viral process of epithelial cells in CC. CONCLUSION: The current study comprehensively analyzed the features of CC samples and differentiation trajectories of epithelial cell subtypes, as well as the role of the Hedgehog pathway in epithelial cells during CC progression. More importantly, effective target genes were discovered for the molecular diagnosis and precise treatment of CC."
39192222,Association of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene rs10069690 variant with cancer risk: an updated meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Existing evidence suggests telomerase activation is a crucial step in tumorigenesis. The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), encoded by the human TERT gene, is critical for telomerase expression. The TERT rs10069690 (C > T) variant was identified to be associated with the risk of cancer, however, there have been inconsistent results. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis aiming to clarify the association between this variant and cancer susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted literature search in PubMed, EMbase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library up to April 30, 2024. Overall, there are 55 studies involving 334,196 patients with cancer and 741,187 controls included in the present study. All statistical analyses were performed by STATA software (version 11.0). RESULTS: The pooled results showed a significant association between rs10069690 and an increased risk of cancer under allele model (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07-1.13, P < 0.001), especially in European and Asian populations. When stratified by cancer types, this variant was associated with elevated risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.15, P < 0.001), ovarian cancer (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.19, P < 0.001), lung cancer (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35, P = 0.003), thyroid cancer (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.15-1.32, P < 0.001), gastric cancer (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.19-1.45, P < 0.001), and renal cell carcinoma (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55, P = 0.007), while decreased risk was found for hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. Our results also indicated that this variant was significantly associated with solid cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.14, P < 0.001), but not with hematological tumor. CONCLUSION: This systematic meta-analysis demonstrated that the TERT rs10069690 variant was a risk factor for cancer. However, the effects of this variant may vary in different types of cancer and differ across ethnic populations."
39191493,The Clinical and Genetic Landscape of Hereditary Cancer: Experience from a Single Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology in the genetic investigation of hereditary cancer is important for clinical surveillance, therapeutic approach, and reducing the risk of developing new malignancies. The aim of the study was to explore genetic predisposition in individuals referred for hereditary cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 8,261 individuals were referred for multigene genetic testing, during the period 2020-2023, in the laboratory, and underwent multigene genetic testing using NGS. Among the examined individuals, 56.17% were diagnosed with breast cancer, 6.77% with ovarian cancer, 2.88% with colorectal cancer, 1.91% with prostate cancer, 6.43% were healthy with a significant family history of cancer, while 3.06% had a different type of cancer and 0.21% had not provided any information. Additionally, in 85 women with breast cancer we performed whole exome sequencing analysis. RESULTS: 20% of the examined individuals carried a pathogenic variant. Specifically, 54.8% of the patients had a pathogenic variant in a clinically significant gene (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, PMS2, CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, TP53, MSH6, APC, RAD51D, PTEN, RET, CDH1, MEN1, and VHL). Among the different types of pathogenic variants detected, a significant percentage (6.52%) represented copy number variation (CNV). With WES analysis, the following findings were detected: CTC1: c.880C>T, p.(Gln294*); MLH3: c.405del, p.(Asp136Metfs*2), PPM1D: c.1426_1430del, p.(Glu476Leufs*3), and SDHB: c.395A>G, p.(His132Arg). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive multigene genetic testing is necessary for appropriate clinical management of pathogenic variants' carriers. Additionally, the information obtained is important for determining the risk of malignancy development in family members of the examined individuals."
39190534,Immunologic signatures of response and resistance to nivolumab with ipilimumab in advanced metastatic cancer.,"Identifying pan-tumor biomarkers that predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is critically needed. In the AMADEUS clinical trial (NCT03651271), patients with various advanced solid tumors were assessed for changes in intratumoral CD8 percentages and their response to ICI. Patients were grouped based on tumoral CD8 levels: those with CD8 <15% (CD8-low) received nivolumab (anti-PD-1) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and those with CD8 >/=15% (CD8-high) received nivolumab monotherapy. 79 patients (72 CD8-low and 7 CD8-high) were treated. The disease control rate was 25.0% (18/72; 95% CI: 15.8-35.2) in CD8-low and 14.3% (1/7; 95% CI: 1.1-43.8) in CD8-high. Tumors from 35.9% (14/39; 95% CI: 21.8-51.4) of patients converted from CD8 <15% pretreatment to >/=15% after treatment. Multiomic analyses showed that CD8-low responders had an inflammatory tumor microenvironment pretreatment, enhanced by an influx of CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, B cells, and macrophages upon treatment. These findings reveal crucial pan-cancer immunological features for ICI response in patients with metastatic disease."
39190201,Optimized workflow of EV enrichment from human plasma samples for downstream mass spectrometry analysis.,"To improve the prognosis of bladder and prostate cancer, highly specific and sensitive biomarkers are needed for early detection, prognosis prediction, and therapeutic stratification. Extracellular vesicles (EV) from plasma could fill this gap due to their potential to serve as cancer biomarkers. However, the enrichment of EV is a major challenge, because the highly abundant plasma proteins are interfering with analytical downstream applications like mass spectrometry (MS). Therefore, the purity requirements of the EV samples must be carefully considered when selecting or developing a suitable EV enrichment method. The aim of this study was to compare a self-designed EV enrichment method based on density cushion centrifugation (DCC) combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and concentration (method 1) with the exoRNeasy midi kit from Qiagen (method 2) and with unprocessed plasma. Furthermore, the single steps of method 1 were evaluated for their effectiveness to enrich EV from plasma. The results showed that the EV samples enriched with method 1 contained the highest levels of EV and exosome markers with simultaneously low levels of highly abundant plasma proteins. In summary, the combination of DCC, SEC and concentration proved to be a promising approach to discover EV-based biomarkers from plasma of cancer patients."
39187920,Functional variants of the pentraxin 3 gene are associated with the metastasis and progression of prostate cancer.,"Age, ethnic background and genetic components have been identified as the established risks for prostate cancer (PCa). Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), originally identified as a pattern-recognition molecule for defence against infectious agents, has multiple functions in tissue repair and in the regulation of cancer-associated inflammation. In this study, we sought to investigate the impact of PTX3 gene variants on the development of PCa. Genotypes of four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTX3 gene, including rs1840680, rs2305619, rs3816527 and rs2120243, were profiled among 705 PCa patients and 705 ethnicity-matched controls. In this study, we found that patients who carry at least one minor allele (C) of rs3816527 (AC and CC) tended to develop advanced forms of diseases (clinical large T stage, OR, 1.593, p = 0.032; pathologically-confirmed nodal spread, OR, 1.987, p = 0.011; metastatic tumour, OR, 3.896, p = 0.032) as compared with those homologous for the major allele (AA). Further stratification analysis showed that such association of rs3816527 with lymphatic and distal metastasis of PCa was accentuated in the younger age group (</=65 at diagnosis) but not seen in the older age group (>65 at diagnosis), suggesting an age-specific effect of PTX3 variants. Prediction of PTX3 protein structure implied that polymorphism may alter the quaternary organization and oligomerization of PTX3 protein. Moreover, our gene silencing experiments and survey of public datasets revealed that elevation of PTX3 levels in PCa was required for cell migration and associated with tumour metastasis. Our results highlight an association of PTX3 rs3816527 with the progression of PCa."
39187844,The PARP1 selective inhibitor saruparib (AZD5305) elicits potent and durable antitumor activity in patient-derived BRCA1/2-associated cancer models.,"BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1/2) inhibitors (PARPi) are targeted therapies approved for homologous recombination repair (HRR)-deficient breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Since inhibition of PARP1 is sufficient to cause synthetic lethality in tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), PARP1 selective inhibitors such as saruparib (AZD5305) are being developed. It is expected that selective PARP1 inhibition leads to a safer profile that facilitates its combination with other DNA damage repair inhibitors. Here, we aimed to characterize the antitumor activity of AZD5305 in patient-derived preclinical models compared to the first-generation PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib and to identify mechanisms of resistance. METHODS: Thirteen previously characterized patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models from breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer patients harboring germline pathogenic alterations in BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 were used to evaluate the efficacy of AZD5305 alone or in combination with carboplatin or an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibitor (ceralasertib) and compared it to the first-generation PARPi olaparib. We performed DNA and RNA sequencing as well as protein-based assays to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to either PARPi. RESULTS: AZD5305 showed superior antitumor activity than the first-generation PARPi in terms of preclinical complete response rate (75% vs. 37%). The median preclinical progression-free survival was significantly longer in the AZD5305-treated group compared to the olaparib-treated group (> 386 days vs. 90 days). Mechanistically, AZD5305 induced more replication stress and genomic instability than the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib in PARPi-sensitive tumors. All tumors at progression with either PARPi (39/39) showed increase of HRR functionality by RAD51 foci formation. The most prevalent resistance mechanisms identified were the acquisition of reversion mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 and the accumulation of hypomorphic BRCA1. AZD5305 did not sensitize PDXs with acquired resistance to olaparib but elicited profound and durable responses when combined with carboplatin or ceralasertib in 3/6 and 5/5 models, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results show that the novel PARP1 selective inhibitor AZD5305 yields a potent antitumor response in PDX models with HRD and delays PARPi resistance alone or in combination with carboplatin or ceralasertib, which supports its use in the clinic as a new therapeutic option."
39186548,Stanniocalcin Protein Expression in Female Reproductive Organs: Literature Review and Public Cancer Database Analysis.,"Stanniocalcin (STC) 1 and 2 serve as antihyperglycemic polypeptide hormones with critical roles in regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis. They additionally function as paracrine and/or autocrine factors involved in numerous physiological processes, including female reproduction. STC1 and STC2 contribute to the pathophysiology of several diseases, including female infertility- and pregnancy-associated conditions, and even tumorigenesis of reproductive organs. This comprehensive review highlights the dynamic expression patterns and potential dysregulation of STC1 and STC2, restricted to female fertility, and infertility- and pregnancy-associated diseases and conditions, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), abnormal uterine bleeding, uterine polyps, and pregnancy complications, like impaired decidualization, preeclampsia, and preterm labor. Furthermore, the review elucidates the role of dysregulated STC in the progression of cancers of the reproductive system, including endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. Additionally, the review evaluates the expression patterns and prognostic significance of STC in gynecological cancers by utilizing existing public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas to help decipher the multifaceted roles of these pleiotropic hormones in disease progression. Understanding the intricate mechanisms by which STC proteins influence all these reviewed conditions could lead to the development of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the context of female reproductive health and oncology."
39185678,Human papillomavirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus in Korean patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer: Evaluation and genetic variability of the noncoding control region.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important causative factor of cervical cancer and is associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a rare and highly fatal cutaneous virus that can cause Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Although coinfection with oncogenic HPV and MCPyV may increase cancer risk, a definitive etiological link has not been established. Recently, genomic variation and genetic diversity in the MCPyV noncoding control region (NCCR) among ethnic groups has been reported. The current study aimed to provide accurate prevalence information on HPV and MCPyV infection/coinfection in NSCLC patients and to evaluate and confirm Korean MCPyV NCCR variant genotypes and sequences. DNA from 150 NSCLC tissues and 150 adjacent control tissues was assessed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting regions of the large T antigen (LT-ag), viral capsid protein 1 (VP1), and NCCR. MCPyV was detected in 22.7% (34 of 150) of NSCLC tissues and 8.0% (12 of 150) of adjacent tissues from Korean patients. The incidence rates of HPV with and without MCPyV were 26.5% (nine of 34) and 12.9% (15 of 116). The MCPyV NCCR genotype prevalence in Korean patients was 21.3% (32 of 150) for subtype I and 6% (nine of 150) for subtype IIc. Subtype I, a predominant East Asian strain containing 25 bp tandem repeats, was most common in the MCPyV NCCR data set. Our results confirm that coinfection with other tumor-associated viruses is not associated with NSCLC. Although the role of NCCR rearrangements in MCPyV infection remains unknown, future studies are warranted to determine the associations of MCPyV NCCR sequence rearrangements with specific diseases."
39184454,PARP inhibitors alone or in combination for prostate cancer.,"DNA repair genomic aberrations in the Homologous Recombination pathway are identifiable in up to 25% of patients with advanced prostate cancer, making them more likely to benefit from treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) alone or in combination with other therapies, particularly when BRCA driver genomic aberrations are documented. Although several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach, the validation of reliable biomarkers predictive of response still needs further improvement to refine patient selection. In this setting, the characterization of resistance mechanisms and the validation of novel biomarkers are critical to maximize clinical benefit and to develop novel treatment combinations to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarize the development of PARPi in prostate cancer as single agent as well as the efficacy of their combination with other drugs, and the future directions for their implementation in the management of advanced prostate cancer."
39184453,Targeting PLOD2 suppresses invasion and metastatic potential in radiorecurrent prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic relapse of prostate cancer after radiotherapy is a significant cause of prostate cancer-related morbidity and mortality. PLOD2 is a mediator of invasion and metastasis that we identified as being upregulated in our highly aggressive radiorecurrent prostate cancer cell line. METHODS: Patient dataset analysis was conducted using a variety of prostate cancer cohorts. Prostate cancer cell lines were treated with siRNA, or the drug PX-478 prior to in vitro invasion, migration, or in vivo chick embryo (CAM) extravasation assay. Protein levels were detected by western blot. For RNA analysis, RNA sequencing was conducted on PLOD2 knockdown cells and validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: PLOD2 is a negative prognostic factor associated with biochemical relapse, driving invasion, migration, and extravasation in radiorecurrent prostate cancer. Mechanistically, HIF1alpha upregulation drives PLOD2 expression in our radiorecurrent prostate cancer cells, which is effectively inhibited by HIF1alpha inhibitor PX-478 to reduce invasion, migration, and extravasation. Finally, the long non-coding RNA LNCSRLR acts as a promoter of invasion downstream of PLOD2. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the role of PLOD2 in radiorecurrent prostate cancer invasiveness, and point towards its potential as a therapeutic target to reduce metastasis and improve survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients."
39183420,Exploration of PVT1 as a biomarker in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor originating from the prostate gland, significantly affecting patients' quality of life and survival rates. Public data was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was constructed to classify gene modules. Functional enrichment analysis was performed through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontology annotations, with results visualized using the Metascape database. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis evaluated gene expression profiles and related pathways, constructed a protein-protein interaction network to predict core genes, analyzed survival data, plotted heatmaps and radar charts, and predicted microRNAs for core genes through miRTarBase. Two prostate cancer datasets (GSE46602 and GSE55909) were analyzed, identifying 710 DEGs. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that DEGs were primarily involved in organic acid metabolism and the P53 signaling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis and Metascape analyses further confirmed the significance of these pathways. After constructing the weighted gene co-expression network analysis network, 3 core genes (DDX21, NOP56, plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 [PVT1]) were identified. Survival analysis indicated that core genes are closely related to patient prognosis. Through comparative toxicogenomics database and miRNA prediction analysis, PVT1 was considered to play a crucial role in the development of prostate cancer. The PVT1 gene is highly expressed in prostate cancer and has the potential to become a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer."
39183332,Understanding the function of Pax5 in development of docetaxel-resistant neuroendocrine-like prostate cancers.,"Resistance to the current Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitor (ARSI) therapies has led to higher incidences of therapy-induced neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer (t-NEPC). This highly aggressive subtype with predominant small-cell-like characteristics is resistant to taxane chemotherapies and has a dismal overall survival. t-NEPCs are mostly treated with platinum-based drugs with a combination of etoposide or taxane and have less selectivity and high systemic toxicity, which often limit their clinical potential. During t-NEPC transformation, adenocarcinomas lose their luminal features and adopt neuro-basal characteristics. Whether the adaptive neuronal characteristics of t-NEPC are responsible for such taxane resistance remains unknown. Pathway analysis from patient gene-expression databases indicates that t-NEPC upregulates various neuronal pathways associated with enhanced cellular networks. To identify transcription factor(s) (TF) that could be important for promoting the gene expression for neuronal characters in t-NEPC, we performed ATAC-Seq, acetylated-histone ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq in our NE-like cell line models and analyzed the promoters of transcriptionally active and significantly enriched neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cancer-specific genes. Our results indicate that Pax5 could be an important transcription factor for neuronal gene expression and specific to t-NEPC. Pathway analysis revealed that Pax5 expression is involved in axonal guidance, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuronal adhesion, which are critical for strong cellular communications. Further results suggest that depletion of Pax5 disrupts neurite-mediated cellular communication in NE-like cells and reduces surface growth factor receptor activation, thereby, sensitizing them to docetaxel therapies. Moreover, t-NEPC-specific hydroxymethylation of Pax5 promoter CpG islands favors Pbx1 binding to induce Pax5 expression. Based on our study, we concluded that continuous exposure to ARSI therapies leads to epigenetic modifications and Pax5 activation in t-NEPC, which promotes the expression of genes necessary to adopt taxane-resistant NE-like cancer. Thus, targeting the Pax5 axis can be beneficial for reverting their taxane sensitivity."
39183140,Barriers and facilitators of the application of precision medicine to the genitourinary cancer care pathway: Perspective from a low- and middle- income country in sub-Saharan Africa.,"The benefit of the delivery of the right form of cancer care, tailored to the right patient, at the right time is increasingly being recognized in the global oncology community. Information on the role and feasible potential of precision oncology during the management of genitourinary cancer in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, is limited. This article, therefore, describes the present application of personalized medicine in Nigeria and its barriers and facilitators. It provided granular details on manpower distribution and epidemiological disparities. It also explored the use of clinical and biological markers for screening and early diagnosis, the application of team science to support genomic profiling, cost-effective approaches for image-based phenotypic precision oncology, the emerging role of molecular imaging, access to clinical trials; and their potential to support data driven diagnosis, treatment decision and care availability in order to address gaps in genitourinary cancer management in the country."
39182081,Prognostic and immunological implications of heterogeneous cell death patterns in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men with a significant proportion of patients developing biochemical recurrence (BCR) after treatment. Programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms are known to play critical roles in tumor progression and can potentially serve as prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers in PCa. This study aimed to develop a prognostic signature for BCR in PCa using PCD-related genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 19 different modes of PCD to develop a comprehensive model. Bulk transcriptomic, single-cell transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical data were collected from multiple cohorts, including TCGA-PRAD, GSE58812, METABRIC, GSE21653, and GSE193337. We analyzed the expression and mutations of the 19 PCD modes and constructed, evaluated, and validated the model. RESULTS: Ten PCD modes were found to be associated with BCR in PCa, with specific PCD patterns exhibited by various cell components within the tumor microenvironment. Through Lasso Cox regression analysis, we established a Programmed Cell Death Index (PCDI) utilizing an 11-gene signature. High PCDI values were validated in five independent datasets and were found to be associated with an increased risk of BCR in PCa patients. Notably, older age and advanced T and N staging were associated with higher PCDI values. By combining PCDI with T staging, we constructed a nomogram with enhanced predictive performance. Additionally, high PCDI values were significantly correlated with decreased drug sensitivity, including drugs such as Docetaxel and Methotrexate. Patients with lower PCDI values demonstrated higher immunophenoscores (IPS), suggesting a potentially higher response rate to immune therapy. Furthermore, PCDI was associated with immune checkpoint genes and key components of the tumor microenvironment, including macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. Finally, clinical specimens validated the differential expression of PCDI-related PCDRGs at both the gene and protein levels. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we developed a novel PCD-based prognostic feature that successfully predicted BCR in PCa patients and provided insights into drug sensitivity and potential response to immune therapy. These findings have significant clinical implications for the treatment of PCa."
39180789,Assessing olaparib efficacy in U.S. Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer utilizing a time-indifferent g-rate method ideal for real-world analyses.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess real-world efficacy of the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in US Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) by leveraging the national data repository and evaluate a novel approach to assess treatment efficacy in tumors considered rare or harboring rare mutations. METHODS: Included Veterans had 1) mPC with somatic or germline alterations/mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR), 2) received olaparib monotherapy as well as a novel hormonal therapy/androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (NHT/ARPI), and/or chemotherapy, and 3) estimable rates of tumor growth (g-rate) using PSA values obtained while receiving treatment. Previous work has shown an excellent inverse correlation of g-rate with survival. Using g-rate, we determined tumor doubling time (DT) and DT ratios (DT on olaparib/DT on prior medication). We postulated that a DT ratio>/= 1 was associated with benefit. FINDINGS: We identified 139 Veterans, including 42 Black males with tumors harboring mutations/alterations in HRR genes who received olaparib: BRCA2 (50), ATM (32), BRCA1 (10), other mutations (47). 62/139 (45%) of all and 21/42 (50%) of Black Veterans had DT ratios >/=1, including 31, 10, 2, and 19 with BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, and other mutations, respectively (p = 0.006). Median survival with DT ratios >/=1 was superior, being 24.5 vs. 11.4 months for DT ratio <1 (p = 0.01, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.85). Benefit from olaparib, defined as DT ratio >/=1, was not observed for germline status, starting PSA value, number of prior therapies, or immediate prior therapy. Compared to matched cohorts, tumors in the olaparib cohort had shorter DTs with enzalutamide in first line (367 vs. 884 days; p = 0.0043). INTERPRETATION: Using equations indifferent to timing of assessments ideal for real-world efficacy analyses, we showed DT ratio >/=1 representing slower tumor growth on olaparib relative to the prior therapy correlates with improved survival. Olaparib efficacy in Veterans with mPC harboring mutations/alterations in HRR genes emulates clinical trial results. Black men had comparable results. Compared to matched cohorts, in first line, enzalutamide was less efficacious in tumors harboring mutations/alterations in HRR genes.

39179310,Evaluation of risk prediction models to select lung cancer screening participants in Europe: a prospective cohort consortium analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer risk prediction models might efficiently identify individuals who should be offered lung cancer screening. However, their performance has not been comprehensively evaluated in Europe. We aimed to externally validate and evaluate the performance of several risk prediction models that predict lung cancer incidence or mortality in prospective European cohorts. METHODS: We analysed 240 137 participants aged 45-80 years with a current or former smoking history from nine European countries in four prospective cohorts from the pooled database of the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium: the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (Finland), the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (Norway), CONSTANCES (France), and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Norway). We evaluated ten lung cancer risk models, which comprised the Bach, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial 2012 model (PLCO(m2012)), the Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (LCRAT), the Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool (LCDRAT), the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), the Optimized Early Warning Model for Lung Cancer Risk (OWL), the University College London-Death (UCLD), the University College London-Incidence (UCLI), the Liverpool Lung Project version 2 (LLP version 2), and the Liverpool Lung Project version 3 (LLP version 3) models. We quantified model calibration as the ratio of expected to observed cases or deaths and discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For each model, we also identified risk thresholds that would screen the same number of individuals as each of the US Preventive Services Task Force 2021 (USPSTF-2021), the US Preventive Services Task Force 2013 (USPSTF-2013), and the Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) criteria. FINDINGS: Among the participants, 1734 lung cancer cases and 1072 lung cancer deaths occurred within five years of enrolment. Most models had reasonable calibration in most countries, although the LLP version 2 overpredicted risk by more than 50% in eight countries (expected to observed >/=1.50). The PLCO(m2012), LCDRAT, LCRAT, Bach, HUNT, OWL, UCLD, and UCLI models showed similar discrimination in most countries, with AUCs ranging from 0.68 (95% CI 0.59-0.77) to 0.83 (0.78-0.89), whereas the LLP version 2 and LLP version 3 showed lower discrimination, with AUCs ranging from 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.72) to 0.78 (0.74-0.83). When pooling data from all countries (but excluding the HUNT cohort), 33.9% (73 313 of 216 387) of individuals were eligible by USPSTF-2021 criteria, which included 74.8% (1185) of lung cancers and 76.3% (730) of lung cancer deaths occurring over 5 years. Fewer individuals were selected by USPSTF-2013 and NELSON criteria. After applying thresholds to select a population of equal size to USPSTF-2021, the PLCO(m2012), LCDRAT, LCRAT, Bach, HUNT, OWL, UCLD, and UCLI, models identified 77.6%-79.1% of future cases, although they selected slightly older individuals compared with USPSTF-2021 criteria. Results were similar for USPSTF-2013 and NELSON. INTERPRETATION: Several lung cancer risk prediction models showed good performance in European countries and might improve the efficiency of lung cancer screening if used in place of categorical eligibility criteria.

39178368,DNA-Damaging Therapies in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Pathogenic Alterations in Homologous Recombination Repair Genes.,"PURPOSE: Outcomes data for DNA-damaging therapeutics for men with prostate cancer (PC) and non-BRCA1/2 homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations are limited. We evaluated outcomes by HRR alteration in men with PC treated with poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and/or platinum chemotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective data from the PROMISE consortium were used. Clinical outcomes differences were assessed between patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (cohort A) and those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction (cohort B: ATM, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, and FANCL). Outcomes in patients with HRR mutations with direct BRCA complex interaction were also explored (cohort C: RAD51B/C/D, RAD54L2, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, and BRIP1). RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six patients received PARPi (cohort A: 94, cohort B: 45, cohort C: 7) and 104 received platinum chemotherapy (cohort A: 48, cohort B: 44, cohort C: 10). PSA50 response rate to PARPi was higher in cohort A (61%) than cohort B (5%), P < .001. Median clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (crPFS) with PARPi in cohort A was significantly longer than in cohort B: 15.9 versus 8.7 months, P = .005. PSA50 response rate to platinum therapy was higher in cohort A (62%) than in cohort B (32%), P = .024, although crPFS was not significantly different. PSA50 response rate to PARPi and platinum was 40% and 32%, respectively, in cohort C. In multivariable analysis, cohort A had significantly improved overall survival and crPFS compared with cohort B with PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with BRCA1/2-mutated PC had significantly improved outcomes to PARPi but not platinum chemotherapy compared with those with HRR mutations without direct BRCA complex interaction."
39178326,HPV induced R-loop formation represses innate immune gene expression while activating DNA damage repair pathways.,"R-loops are trimeric nucleic acid structures that form when an RNA molecule hybridizes with its complementary DNA strand, displacing the opposite strand. These structures regulate transcription as well as replication, but aberrant R-loops can form, leading to DNA breaks and genomic instability if unresolved. R-loop levels are elevated in many cancers as well as cells that maintain high-risk human papillomaviruses. We investigated how the distribution as well as function of R-loops changed between normal keratinocytes and HPV positive cells derived from a precancerous lesion of the cervix (CIN I). The levels of R-loops associated with cellular genes were found to be up to 10-fold higher in HPV positive cells than in normal keratinocytes while increases at ALU1 elements increased by up to 500-fold. The presence of enhanced R-loops resulted in altered levels of gene transcription, with equal numbers increased as decreased. While no uniform global effects on transcription due to the enhanced levels of R-loops were detected, genes in several pathways were coordinately increased or decreased in expression only in the HPV positive cells. This included the downregulation of genes in the innate immune pathway, such as DDX58, IL-6, STAT1, IFN-beta, and NLRP3. All differentially expressed innate immune genes dependent on R-loops were also associated with H3K36me3 modified histones. Genes that were upregulated by the presence of R-loops in HPV positive cells included those in the DNA damage repair such as ATM, ATRX, and members of the Fanconi Anemia pathway. These genes exhibited a linkage between R-loops and H3K36me3 as well as gammaH2AX histone marks only in HPV positive cells. These studies identify a potential link in HPV positive cells between DNA damage repair as well as innate immune regulatory pathways with R-loops and gammaH2AX/H3K36me3 histone marks that may contribute to regulating important functions for HPV pathogenesis."
39177583,Genomic and Epigenomic Analysis of Plasma Cell-Free DNA Identifies Stemness Features Associated with Worse Survival in Lethal Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) resistant to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) is often lethal. Liquid biopsy biomarkers for this deadly form of disease remain under investigation, and underpinning mechanisms remain ill-understood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We applied targeted cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing to 126 patients with mCRPC from three academic cancer centers and separately performed genome-wide cfDNA methylation sequencing on 43 plasma samples collected prior to the initiation of first-line ARSI treatment. To analyze the genome-wide sequencing data, we performed nucleosome positioning and differential methylated region analysis. We additionally analyzed single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from 14 and 80 patients with mCRPC, respectively, to develop and validate a stem-like signature, which we inferred from cfDNA. RESULTS: Targeted cfDNA sequencing detected AR/enhancer alterations prior to first-line ARSIs that correlated with significantly worse progression-free survival (P = 0.01; HR = 2.12) and overall survival (P = 0.02; HR = 2.48). Plasma methylome analysis revealed that AR/enhancer lethal mCRPC patients have significantly higher promoter-level hypomethylation than AR/enhancer wild-type mCRPC patients (P < 0.0001). Moreover, gene ontology and CytoTRACE analysis of nucleosomally more accessible transcription factors in cfDNA revealed enrichment for stemness-associated transcription factors in patients with lethal mCRPC. The resulting stemness signature was then validated in a completely held-out cohort of 80 patients with mCRPC profiled by tumor RNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed a total of 220 patients with mCRPC, validated the importance of cell-free AR/enhancer alterations as a prognostic biomarker in lethal mCRPC, and showed that the underlying mechanism for lethality involves reprogramming developmental states toward increased stemness. See related commentary by Nawfal et al., p. 7."
39177091,MetDecode: methylation-based deconvolution of cell-free DNA for noninvasive multi-cancer typing.,"MOTIVATION: Circulating-cell free DNA (cfDNA) is widely explored as a noninvasive biomarker for cancer screening and diagnosis. The ability to decode the cells of origin in cfDNA would provide biological insights into pathophysiological mechanisms, aiding in cancer characterization and directing clinical management and follow-up. RESULTS: We developed a DNA methylation signature-based deconvolution algorithm, MetDecode, for cancer tissue origin identification. We built a reference atlas exploiting de novo and published whole-genome methylation sequencing data for colorectal, breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer, and blood-cell-derived entities. MetDecode models the contributors absent in the atlas with methylation patterns learnt on-the-fly from the input cfDNA methylation profiles. In addition, our model accounts for the coverage of each marker region to alleviate potential sources of noise. In-silico experiments showed a limit of detection down to 2.88% of tumor tissue contribution in cfDNA. MetDecode produced Pearson correlation coefficients above 0.95 and outperformed other methods in simulations (P < 0.001; T-test; one-sided). In plasma cfDNA profiles from cancer patients, MetDecode assigned the correct tissue-of-origin in 84.2% of cases. In conclusion, MetDecode can unravel alterations in the cfDNA pool components by accurately estimating the contribution of multiple tissues, while supplied with an imperfect reference atlas. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MetDecode is available at https://github.com/JorisVermeeschLab/MetDecode."
39176294,Prostate cancer genotyping for risk stratification and precision treatment.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. It is heterogeneous, as is evident from the wide spectrum of therapeutic approaches. Most patients with PC are initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy; however, the majority of cases are either hormone-sensitive PC or castration-resistant PC. Current therapeutic protocols follow the evolution of PC, a continuously progressive process involving a combination of widespread genomic alterations. These genomic alterations are either hereditary germline mutations, such as mutations in BRCA2, or specific only to tumor cells (somatic). Tumor-specific genomic spectra include genomic structural rearrangements, canonical androgen response genes, and many other specific genes such as TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, SPOP/FOXA1, TP53/RB1/PTEN, and BRCA2. New evidence indicates the involvement of signaling pathways including PI3K, WNT/beta-catenin, SRC, and IL-6/STAT, which have been shown to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition cancer stem cell-like features/stemness, and neuroendocrine differentiation in PC. Over the last decade, our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationships has been enhanced considerably. The genetic background of PC related to canonical genetic alterations and signaling pathway activation genes has shed more insight into the molecular subtype and disease landscape, resulting in a more flexible role of individual therapies targeting diverse genotypes and phenotypes."
39176273,Causal relationship between gut microbiota and gynecological tumor: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has established associations between alterations in gut microbiota composition and various gynecologic tumors. However, establishing a causal relationship between gut microbiota and these tumors remains necessary. This study employs a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate causality, aiming to identify pathogenic bacterial communities potentially involved in gynecologic tumor development. METHODS: Data from the MiBioGen consortium's Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on gut microbiota were used as the exposure variable. Four common gynecologic neoplasms, including uterine fibroids (UF), endometrial cancer (EC), ovarian cancer (OC), and cervical cancer (CC), were selected as outcome variables. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with gut microbiota were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs). The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary MR analysis to assess the causal relationship. External validation An was conducted using an independent. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure robustness. Reverse MR analysis was also conducted to assess potential reverse causation. RESULTS: Combining discovery and validation cohorts, we found that higher relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae is associated with lower UF risk (OR: 0.882, 95% CI: 0.793-0.982, P = 0.022). Conversely, higher OC incidence is associated with increased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae (OR: 1.329, 95% CI: 1.019-1.732, P = 0.036). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings' reliability. Reverse MR analysis showed no evidence of reverse causation between UF, OC, and Lachnospiraceae. DISCUSSION: This study establishes a causal relationship between Lachnospiraceae relative abundance and both UF and OC. These findings provide new insights into the potential role of gut microbiota in mechanisms underlying gynecological tumors development."
39175940,Transcriptomic analysis of mouse TRAMP cell lines and tumors provide insights into shared pathways and therapeutic targets.,"The present study focused on comparing the gene expression profiles of different mouse models of prostate cancer, focusing on the TRAMP transgenic model and its derived cell lines and extending the comparisons to relevant genetically engineered mouse models and human prostate cancer datasets. Employing RNA sequencing, we examined different levels of prostate cancer aggressiveness from the original TRAMP cells to the TRAMP-C2 (TC2) derived cell line and extending to the aggressive TC2-Ras (TC2R) cells and tumors. TC2R acquire the ability to grow in bone tissue upon implantation, unlike the parental TC2 cells. Analysis identified upregulated genes in cell cycle regulation, immune response, and mitotic processes in TRAMP compared to wild-type tissues. TC2 cells exhibited unique gene profiles enriched in ECM organization and tissue development pathways, while TC2R cells showed increased cytokine signaling and motility genes, with decreased ECM and immune response pathways. In vivo TC2R models demonstrated enhanced ECM organization and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in tumors, notably enriching immune processes and collagen degradation pathways in intratibial tumors. Comparative analysis among mouse and human datasets showed overlaps, particularly in pathways relating to mitotic cycle regulation, ECM organization, and immune interactions. A gene signature identified in TC2R tumors correlated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival in human datasets. Further immune cell landscape analysis of TC2R tumors revealed altered T cell subsets and macrophages, confirmed in single-cell RNA-seq from human samples. TC2R models thus hold significant promise in helping advance preclinical therapeutics, potentially contributing to improved prostate cancer patient outcomes."
39175775,WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 activation through C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2/leukemia inhibitory factor/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling promotes immunosuppression and neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.,"The interaction between prostate cancer (PCa) cells and prostate stromal cells fosters an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes tumor growth and immune evasion. However, the specific signaling pathways involved remain unclear. We identified a key mechanism involving the CXCL5/CXCR2 and LIF/LIFR pathways, which create a feedforward loop that enhances neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in PCa cells and upregulates WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in both cell types. WISP1 upregulation is essential for inducing immune checkpoints and immunosuppressive cytokines via LIF/LIFR signaling and STAT3 phosphorylation. This process leads to increased neuroendocrine markers, immune checkpoints, cell proliferation, and migration. Notably, WISP1 levels in patient sera correlate with PCa progression, suggesting its potential as a biomarker. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms by which reciprocal communication between PCa cells and stromal cells contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME, driving the malignant progression of PCa and highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
39175187,Cryo-Nanocatalyst Enhances Therapeutic Efficacy of Cryo-Immunotherapy through Necroptosis and Local Delivery of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Inhibitors.,"Combining cryoablation and immunotherapy presents a promising approach to revert immunosuppressive responses to solid tumors. However, challenges such as postablated residual tumors and insufficient immune activity contribute to recurrence after cryo-immunotherapy. Herein, we investigated metallic supra-structured cryo-nanocatalyst (MSCN), which features numerous ice nucleation sites and interspace loading of therapeutic agents. MSCN elevates the freezing point and enhances ice nucleation, facilitating effective ice formation during cryotreatment. MSCN-loaded tumor cells showed a 2-fold increase in cryo-cytotoxicity and undergo osmotic-related cell damage, primarily necroptosis rather than other regulated cell death mechanisms. In prostate cancer models, RNA sequencing reveals that MSCN-cryoablation promoted antitumor inflammatory pathways, including necroptosis, compared to cryoablation alone. Additionally, following programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation postcryoablation, synergistic effects with PD-L1 blockade were confirmed. Given the interspace of MSCN for aPD-L1 loading, we compared the intratumoral delivery of PD-L1 blockade against systemic injection. Enhanced necrosis and necroptosis from MSCN-cryoablation and PD-L1 blockade effectively eradicated tumors and triggered antitumor and memory immune responses locally and systemically. Lastly, a spatial landscape of tumor-infiltrating immune cells was analyzed to gain insight into heterogeneous tumor responses, leading to the limitations of conventional focal ablation techniques. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced cryo-immunotherapy using cryo-nanocatalysis to promote ice formation and necroptosis, stimulating antitumor immunogenic responses."
39174333,"The guidelines for clinical practice for carriers of germline mutations in hereditary breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer predisposition genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2 (4.2024).","The Guidelines for Clinical Practice for carriers of pathogenic variants in clinically relevant cancer predisposition genes define the steps of primary and secondary prevention that should be provided to these individuals at high risk of developing hereditary cancer in the Czech Republic. The drafting of the guidelines was organized by the Oncogenetics Working Group of the Society for Medical Genetics and Genomics of J. E. Purkyne Czech Medical Society (SLG CLS JEP) in cooperation with the representatives of oncology and oncogynecology. The guidelines are based on the current recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and take into account the capacity of the Czech healthcare system."
39173603,Streamlined Genetic Education and Cascade Testing in Men from Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer Families: A Randomized Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: When a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is identified in a family, cascade genetic testing of family members is recommended since the results may inform screening or treatment decisions in men and women. However, rates of cascade testing are low, and men are considerably less likely than women to pursue cascade testing. To facilitate cascade testing in men, we designed a Web-based genetic education tool that addressed barriers to cascade testing, was individually tailored, delivered proactively, and could be used in lieu of pretest genetic counseling to streamline the cascade testing process. METHODS: We randomized 63 untested men from hereditary cancer families to Web-based genetic education (WGE) versus enhanced usual care (EUC). WGE participants were provided access to a genetic education website after which they could accept or decline genetic testing or opt for pretest genetic counseling. EUC participants received an informational brochure and a letter informing them of their eligibility for genetic testing and recommending they schedule genetic counseling. The primary outcome was the uptake of genetic testing. RESULTS: Men in the WGE group were more likely to complete genetic counseling and/or genetic testing (43% vs. 12.1%; chi2 [n = 63, df = 1] = 7.77, p = 0.005). WGE participants were also more likely to complete genetic testing compared to men in the EUC group (30% vs. 9.1%; chi2 [n = 63, df = 1] = 4.46, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This preliminary trial suggests that a streamlined approach to genetic testing using proactively delivered genetic education may reduce barriers to cascade testing for at-risk men, leading to increased uptake. These results should be interpreted cautiously given the select sample and high rate of non-response."
39173467,Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR: A biomarker and therapeutic target in urological tumors.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly influence gene regulation across epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels through their interactions with DNA, RNA, and proteins. There is growing evidence of lncRNAs' critical roles in the emergence and progression of various diseases, including urological tumors (UTs), such as cancers of the kidney, bladder, and prostate. Research increasingly links lncRNA dysregulation to diverse cellular processes like invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. Among these, HOTAIR stands out for its pivotal role in oncogenesis, impacting treatment resistance, cell migration, proliferation, survival, and genomic integrity. This review provides an overview of HOTAIR's functions, its identification, and its biological significance. Furthermore, it delves into HOTAIR's involvement in UTs, underlining its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for innovative approaches to treating these cancers."
39172448,Trends in Active Surveillance for Men With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.,"IMPORTANCE: Initial management of intermediate-risk prostate cancer is evolving, with no clear recommendation for treatment. Data on utilization of active surveillance for patients with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk prostate cancer may help clarify emerging trends. OBJECTIVE: To further characterize US national trends of initial management of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer diagnosed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. Eligible patients were diagnosed in US hospitals included in the National Cancer Database; National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk stratification guidelines were used to characterize as favorable vs unfavorable intermediate risk. Analysis was performed in September 2023. EXPOSURE: Active surveillance vs intervention with surgery and/or radiation or no treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Temporal trends in demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors among men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and their association with the use of active surveillance; further subgroup analysis was conducted for those with favorable vs unfavorable intermediate risk classification. RESULTS: In total, 289 584 men diagnosed with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were identified from 2010 to 2020 (46 147 Black [15.9%], 230 071 White [79.5%]). Among patients, 153 726 (53.1%) underwent prostatectomy, 107 152 (37.0%) underwent radiotherapy, and 15 847 (5.5%) underwent active surveillance as initial treatment strategy. Overall, active surveillance quadrupled from 418 of 21 457 patients (2.0%) in 2010 to 2428 of 28 192 patients (8.6%) in 2020 for the entire cohort (P < .001). Active surveillance increased from 317 of 12 858 patients (2.4%) in 2010 to 2020 of 12 902 patients (13.5%) in 2020 in men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (P < .001). In the unfavorable intermediate-risk cohort, active surveillance increased from 101 of 8181 patients (1.2%) in 2010 to 408 of 12 861 patients (3.1%) in 2020 (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, use of active surveillance was associated with increased age (age 70-80 years vs <50 years: odds ratio [OR], 3.09; 95% CI, 2.66-3.59), lower Gleason score (3 + 3 vs 3 + 4: OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 3.25-3.66), early T stage (T2c vs T1a through T2a: OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.32-0.38), treatment at an academic center (community vs academic center: OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67-0.78), higher level of education (communities with 21% or higher population without high school vs less than 7%: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79), insurance type (Medicare or other governmental service vs private: OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16), proximity to treatment facility (greater than 120 miles vs less than 60 miles: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.84), facility location (South Atlantic vs New England: OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.53), and lower income (less than $38 000 vs $63 000 or greater: OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings highlight increasing implementation of active surveillance in the initial management of intermediate risk prostate cancer. Prospective data with improved risk stratification incorporating genomics and digital pathology artificial intelligence as well as novel surveillance strategies may continue to better delineate optimal treatment recommendations in this patient population."
39172235,Real-world data on the prevalence of BRCA1/2 and HRR gene mutations in patients with primary and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study seeks to contribute real-world data on the prevalence of BRCA1/2 and HRR gene mutations in prostate cancer. METHODS: We compiled sequencing data of 197 cases of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, in which HRR mutation analysis was performed upon clinical request within the last 5 years. All cases were analyzed using a targeted NGS BRCAness multigene panel, including 8 HRR genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, HDAC2, PALB2). RESULTS: Our findings reveal a prevalence of potentially targetable mutations based on FDA criteria of 20.8%, which is comparable to the literature. However, the frequency of targetable BRCA2 mutations within our cohort was lower than reported for mCRPC and ATM and CHEK2 mutations were more prevalent instead. Thus, while 20.8% (n = 38) of the cases meet the criteria for olaparib treatment per FDA approval, only 4.9% (n = 9) align with the eligibility criteria according to the EMA approval. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable real-world insights into the landscape of BRCA1/2 and HRR gene mutations and the practical clinical management of HRR gene testing in prostate cancer, contributing to a better understanding of patient eligibility for PARPi treatment."
39171738,Cervical mucus can be used for metabolite screening in cervical cancer.,"Approximately 660,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually. Current screening options such as cytology or human papillomavirus testing have limitations, creating a need to identify more effective ancillary biomarkers for triage. Here, we evaluated whether metabolomic analysis of cervical mucus metabolism could be used to identify biomarkers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. The case-control group consisted of 181 CIN, 69 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients, and 48 healthy controls in the primary cohort. We undertook metabolomic analyses using ultra-HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to profile metabolite characteristics, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified biomarker candidates. Five metabolites conferred the highest discriminatory power for SCC: oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (area under the ROC curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.877-0.971), malic acid (0.914, 0.859-0.968), kynurenine (0.884, 0.823-0.945), GSSG/glutathione (GSH) (0.936, 0.892-0.979), and kynurenine/tryptophan (0.909, 0.856-0.961). Malic acid was the best marker for detection of CIN2 or worse (0.858, 0.793-0.922) and was a clinically useful metabolite. We confirmed the reproducibility of the results by validation cohort. Additionally, metabolomic analyses revealed eight pathways strongly associated with cervical neoplasia. Of these, only the tricarboxylic acid cycle was strongly associated with all CINs and cancer, indicating active energy production. Aberrant arginine metabolism by decreasing arginine and increasing citrulline might reduce tumor immunity. Changes in cysteine-methionine and GSH pathways might drive the initiation and progression of cervical cancer. These results suggest that metabolic analysis can identify ancillary biomarkers and could improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cervical neoplasia."
39170882,Periprostatic adipose tissue inhibits tumor progression by secreting apoptotic factors: A natural barrier induced by the immune response during the early stages of prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most prevalent malignancy in men worldwide. The risk factors for PCa include obesity, age and family history. Increased visceral fat has been associated with high PCa risk, which has prompted previous researchers to investigate the influence of body composition and fat distribution on PCa prognosis. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on the mechanisms and interactions between periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) and PCa cells. The present study investigated the association between the composition of pelvic adipose tissue and PCa aggressiveness to understand the role played by this tissue in PCa progression. Moreover, PPAT-conditioned medium (CM) was prepared to assess the influence of the PPAT secretome on the pathophysiology of PCa. The present study included 50 patients with localized PCa who received robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Medical records were collected, magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed and body compositions were calculated to identify the associations between adipose tissue volume and clinical PCa aggressiveness. In addition, CM was prepared from PPAT and perivesical adipose tissue (PVAT) collected from 25 patients during surgery, and its effects on the PCa cell lines C4-2 and LNCaP, and the prostate epithelial cell line PZ-HPV-7, were investigated using a cell proliferation assay and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The results revealed that the initial prostate-specific antigen level was significantly correlated with pelvic and periprostatic adipose tissue volumes. In addition, PPAT volume was significantly higher in patients with extracapsular tumor extension. PCa cell proliferation was significantly reduced when the cells were cultured in PPAT-CM compared with when they were cultured in control- and PVAT-CM. RNA-seq revealed that immune responses, and the cell death and apoptosis pathways were enriched in PPAT-CM-cultured cells indicating that the cytokines or other factors secreted from PPAT-CM induced PCa cell apoptosis. These findings revealed that the PPAT secretome may inhibit PCa cell proliferation by activating immune responses and promoting cancer cell apoptosis. This mechanism may act as a first-line defense during the early stages of PCa."
39170268,Changes in immunophenotypes after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy for prostate cancer and their clinical significance.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate changes in the immunophenotypes of androgen receptor (AR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), synaptophysin (Syn), chromogranin A (CgA), p53 and Ki-67 after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) for prostate cancer (PCa) and to analyze their clinical significance. METHODS: Paired paraffin samples were collected from 40 PCa patients before and after NET, and immunohistochemistry were used to detect AR, PSA, Syn, CgA, p53 and Ki-67 expression. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Kaplan‒Meier survival curves were plotted for analysis of PSA and Ki-67 expression in relation to progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: After NET, the mean scores for PSA and Ki-67 expression in PCa patients were lower than those before NET (P < 0.05), while the mean scores for Syn and CgA expression were higher than those before NET (P < 0.05). The mean Gleason score and WHO/ISUP (World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology) grade after NET were lower than those before NET (P < 0.05). In PCa patients who had not yet received NET, PSA expression correlated positively with Gleason score and WHO/ISUP grade and negatively with Ki-67 expression (P < 0.05); p53 expression correlated negatively with Gleason score and WHO/ISUP grade (P < 0.05). TCGA showed that PFS was lower in PCa patients with high PSA and Ki-67 expression (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PSA and Ki-67 protein expressions decreased significantly in PCa patients after NET and can be used as biological markers for prognostic assessment of PCa patients. NETs may induce a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype in PCa. Monitoring the immunophenotypes of PCa patients after NET may inform assessment of efficacy and prognosis."
39170128,The role of HR-HPV integration in the progression of premalignant lesions into different cancer types.,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is associated with the development of different types of cancer, such as cervical, head and neck (including oral, laryngeal, and oropharyngeal), vulvar, vaginal, penile, and anal cancers. The progression of premalignant lesions to cancer depends on factors associated with the host cell and the different epithelia infected by HPV, such as basal cells of the flat epithelium and the cells of the squamocolumnar transformation zone (STZ) found in the uterine cervix and the anal canal, which is rich in heparan sulfate proteoglycans and integrin-like receptors. On the other hand, factors associated with the viral genotype, infection with multiple viruses, viral load, viral persistence, and type of integration determine the viral breakage pattern and the sites at which the virus integrates into the host cell genome (introns, exons, intergenic regions), inducing the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes and increasing oncogene expression. This review describes the role of viral integration and the molecular mechanisms induced by HR-HPV in different types of tissues. The purpose of this review is to identify the common factors associated with the role of integration events in the progression of premalignant lesions in different types of cancer."
39169299,Association between gynecologic cancer and Alzheimer's disease: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests with a higher rate of occurrence in women. Previous epidemiological studies have suggested a potential association between AD and gynecological cancers, but the causal relationship between them remains unclear. This study aims to explore the causal link between 12 types of gynecological cancers and AD using a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. METHODS: We obtained genetic correlation tools for AD using data from the most extensive genome-wide association study. Genetic correlation data for 12 types of gynecological cancers were also sourced from the Finnish Biobank. These cancers include breast cancer (BC), cervical adenocarcinoma (CA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), cervical cancer (CC), endometrial cancer (EC), ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (OEC), ovarian cancer (OC), ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC), breast carcinoma in situ (BCIS), cervical carcinoma in situ (CCIS), endometrial carcinoma in situ (ECIS), and vulvar carcinoma in situ (VCIS). We used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model for causal analysis and conducted horizontal pleiotropy tests, heterogeneity tests, MR-PRESSO tests, and leave-one-out analyses to ensure the robustness of our results. We also applied replication analysis and meta-analysis to further validate our experimental results. RESULTS: The study found that EC (P(_IVW) =0.037, OR [95% CI] = 1.032 [1.002, 1.064]) and CCIS (P(_IVW) = 0.046, OR [95% CI] = 1.032 [1.011, 1.064]) increase the risk of AD, whereas OC was negatively correlated with AD (P(_IVW) = 0.016, OR [95% CI] = 0.974[0.954, 0.995]). In reverse MR analysis, AD increased the risk of CC (P(_IVW) = 0.039, OR [95% CI] = 1.395 [1.017, 1.914]) and VCIS (P(_IVW) = 0.041, OR [95% CI] = 1.761 [1.027, 2.021]), but was negatively correlated with OEC (P(_IVW) = 0.034, OR [95% CI] = 0.634 [0.417, 0.966]). Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated robustness. These findings were further substantiated through replication and meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study supports a causal relationship between AD and gynecological cancers. This encourages further research into the incidence of gynecological cancers in female Alzheimer's patients and the active prevention of AD."
39169067,Unveiling FRG1's DNA repair role in breast cancer.,"The FRG1(FSHD region gene 1) gene has emerged as a pivotal tumor suppressor in both breast and prostate cancer. HPF1 (Histone PARylation Factor 1), a gene crucial in the base excision repair (BER) mechanism for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) lesions, showcases a robust correlation with FRG1. This implies that FRG1 might have the capacity to influence BER via HPF1, potentially playing a role in tumorigenesis. Using a comprehensive approach that integrates in-silico analyses involving differential gene expression, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), GO (Gene Ontology), and STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) databases, we unravelled the intricate network of genes and pathways influenced by FRG1, which includes BER. Our linear regression analysis unveiled a positive relationship between FRG1 and key genes crucial for BER. Notably, breast cancer patients with low FRG1 expression exhibited a significantly higher frequency of mutation in TP53. To enhance the accuracy of our analysis, we conducted qRT-PCR assays, which demonstrated that FRG1 affects the transcription of DNA base excision repair genes, showing differential expression in breast cancer cells. Moreover, through the Alkaline Comet Assay, a technique that quantifies DNA damage at the single-cell level, we observed diminished DNA repair capabilities when FRG1 levels are low. Risk scores were calculated using the Cox regression coefficients, and we found notable differences in Overall Survival (OS) and mRNA expression of DEGs in the low and high-risk groups. In summary, our findings shed light on the pivotal role of FRG1 in maintaining DNA repair efficiency within breast cancer cells."
39168978,A class I PI3K signalling network regulates primary cilia disassembly in normal physiology and disease.,"Primary cilia are antenna-like organelles which sense extracellular cues and act as signalling hubs. Cilia dysfunction causes a heterogeneous group of disorders known as ciliopathy syndromes affecting most organs. Cilia disassembly, the process by which cells lose their cilium, is poorly understood but frequently observed in disease and upon cell transformation. Here, we uncover a role for the PI3Kalpha signalling enzyme in cilia disassembly. Genetic PI3Kalpha-hyperactivation, as observed in PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) and cancer, induced a ciliopathy-like phenotype during mouse development. Mechanistically, PI3Kalpha and PI3Kbeta produce the PIP(3) lipid at the cilia transition zone upon disassembly stimulation. PI3Kalpha activation initiates cilia disassembly through a kinase signalling axis via the PDK1/PKCiota kinases, the CEP170 centrosomal protein and the KIF2A microtubule-depolymerising kinesin. Our data suggest diseases caused by PI3Kalpha-activation may be considered 'Disorders with Ciliary Contributions', a recently-defined subset of ciliopathies in which some, but not all, of the clinical manifestations result from cilia dysfunction."
39168364,Inhibition of the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein SREBF-1 Overcomes Docetaxel Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Resistance to antiandrogens and chemotherapy (Cx) limits therapeutic options for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC) prostate cancer. In this context, up-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor is identified as a potential bypass mechanism in mCRPC. A combination of docetaxel and mifepristone (Doc + RU-486), an inhibitor of the glucocorticoid receptor, re-sensitizes docetaxel-resistant cell models to Cx. This study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. RNA sequencing was performed in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell models after Doc + RU-486 treatment with consecutive functional assays. Expression of selected proteins was verified in prostatic tissue from prostate cancer patients with progressive disease. Treatment with Doc + RU-486 significantly reduced cancer cell viability, and RNA sequencing revealed sterol regulatory element of binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF-1), a transcription factor of cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis, as a significantly down-regulated target. Functional assays confirmed that SREBF-1 down-regulation is partially responsible for this observation. In concordance, SREBF-1 knockdown and pharmacologic sterol regulatory element binding protein inhibition, together with other key enzymes in the cholesterol pathway, showed similar results. Furthermore, SREBF-1 expression is significantly elevated in advanced prostate cancer tissues, showing its potential involvement in tumor progression and emerging therapy resistance. Therefore, specific inhibition of cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis might also target Cx-resistant cancer cells and represents a potential additive future therapeutic option to improve mCRPC therapy."
39168102,Proteomic landscape profiling of primary prostate cancer reveals a 16-protein panel for prognosis prediction.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignant tumor in men. Currently, there are few prognosis indicators for predicting PCa outcomes and guiding treatments. Here, we perform comprehensive proteomic profiling of 918 tissue specimens from 306 Chinese patients with PCa using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). We identify over 10,000 proteins and define three molecular subtypes of PCa with significant clinical and proteomic differences. We develop a 16-protein panel that effectively predicts biochemical recurrence (BCR) for patients with PCa, which is validated in six published datasets and one additional 99-biopsy-sample cohort by targeted proteomics. Interestingly, this 16-protein panel effectively predicts BCR across different International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades and pathological stages and outperforms the D'Amico risk classification system in BCR prediction. Furthermore, double knockout of NUDT5 and SEPTIN8, two components from the 16-protein panel, significantly suppresses the PCa cells to proliferate, invade, and migrate, suggesting the combination of NUDT5 and SEPTIN8 may provide new approaches for PCa treatment."
39168093,HSD3B1 genotype and outcomes in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy and enzalutamide: ARCHES.,"HSD3B1 encodes 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1, which converts adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and is inherited in adrenal-permissive (AP) or adrenal-restrictive forms. The AP allele is linked to castration resistance, mainly in low-volume tumors. Here, we investigate the association of HSD3B1 alleles with outcomes in ARCHES, a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial that demonstrated clinical benefit with enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) compared to those treated with placebo plus ADT. There are no significant differences between genotypes for clinical efficacy endpoints. Enzalutamide significantly improves radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival vs. placebo irrespective of HSD3B1 status. Men with the AP genotype have higher post-progression mortality and treatment-emergent adverse events, including hypertension, cardiovascular events, and gynecomastia, but a lower fracture rate. Overall, enzalutamide is beneficial in men with mHSPC independent of the HSD3B1 genotype. Inherited polymorphisms of HSD3B1 may account for differential toxicities."
39166898,The Proteogenomics of Prostate Cancer Radioresistance.,"Prostate cancer is frequently treated with radiotherapy. Unfortunately, aggressive radioresistant relapses can arise, and the molecular underpinnings of radioresistance are unknown. Modern clinical radiotherapy is evolving to deliver higher doses of radiation in fewer fractions (hypofractionation). We therefore analyzed genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data to characterize prostate cancer radioresistance in cells treated with both conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated radiotherapy. Independent of fractionation schedule, resistance to radiotherapy involved massive genomic instability and abrogation of DNA mismatch repair. Specific prostate cancer driver genes were modulated at the RNA and protein levels, with distinct protein subcellular responses to radiotherapy. Conventional fractionation led to a far more aggressive biomolecular response than hypofractionation. Testing preclinical candidates identified in cell lines, we revealed POLQ (DNA Polymerase Theta) as a radiosensitizer. POLQ-modulated radioresistance in model systems and was predictive of it in large patient cohorts. The molecular response to radiation is highly multimodal and sheds light on prostate cancer lethality. SIGNIFICANCE: Radiation is standard of care in prostate cancer. Yet, we have little understanding of its failure. We demonstrate a new paradigm that radioresistance is fractionation specific and identified POLQ as a radioresistance modulator."
39165252,Novel Gammapapillomavirus type in the nasal cavity of a wild red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles).,"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are double-stranded, circular, epitheliotropic DNA viruses causing benign warts (papillomas) or inducing dysplasia that can progress to cancer. Although they have been identified in all vertebrate taxa, most classified types are human PVs (HPVs); relatively little is known about PVs in other species. Here we characterize a novel Gammapapillomavirus type, PtepPV1, from a nasal swab of a wild red colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The virus has a genome of 6576 bases, encoding the seven canonical early (E) ORFs (E6, E7, E1, E2, E4, E1;E4 and E8;E2) and two late (L) ORFs (L1 and L2) of the gammapapillomaviruses, and is 81.0% similar to HPV-mSK_118, detected in a cutaneous wart from an immunocompromised human patient, in the L1 gene at the amino acid level. Alphapapillomaviruses (genus Alphapapillomavirus) cause anogenital carcinomas such as cervical cancer and have been described previously in several nonhuman primates. However, the first gammapapillomavirus (genus Gammapapillomavirus), which cause transient cutaneous infections, was not described until 2019 in a healthy rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) genital swab. The new virus from red colobus, PtepPV1, has many genomic features encoded by high-risk oncogenic PVs, such as the E7 gene LXSXE and CXXC motifs, suggesting potential for pRb and zinc-finger binding, respectively. To our knowledge, PtepPV1 is also the first reported nonhuman primate PV found in the nasal cavity. PtepPV1 expands the known host range, geographical distribution, tissue tropism and biological characteristics of nonhuman primate PVs."
39164518,Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and taxanes in metastatic prostate cancer: an outcome-adaptive randomized platform trial.,"ProBio is the first outcome-adaptive platform trial in prostate cancer utilizing a Bayesian framework to evaluate efficacy within predefined biomarker signatures across systemic treatments. Prospective circulating tumor DNA and germline DNA analysis was performed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer before randomization to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs), taxanes or a physician's choice control arm. The primary endpoint was the time to no longer clinically benefitting (NLCB). Secondary endpoints included overall survival and (serious) adverse events. Upon reaching the time to NLCB, patients could be re-randomized. The primary endpoint was met after 218 randomizations. ARPIs demonstrated ~50% longer time to NLCB compared to taxanes (median, 11.1 versus 6.9 months) and the physician's choice arm (median, 11.1 versus 7.4 months) in the biomarker-unselected or 'all' patient population. ARPIs demonstrated longer overall survival (median, 38.7 versus 21.7 and 21.8 months for taxanes and physician's choice, respectively). Biomarker signature findings suggest that the largest increase in time to NLCB was observed in AR (single-nucleotide variant/genomic structural rearrangement)-negative and TP53 wild-type patients and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive patients, whereas no difference between ARPIs and taxanes was observed in TP53-altered patients. In summary, ARPIs outperform taxanes and physician's choice treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with detectable circulating tumor DNA.

39162992,Pre-existing cell subpopulations in primary prostate cancer tumors display surface fingerprints of docetaxel-resistant cells.,"PURPOSE: Docetaxel resistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), resulting in unfavorable patient prognoses. Intratumoral heterogeneity, often associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), has previously emerged as a phenomenon that facilitates adaptation to various stimuli, thus promoting cancer cell diversity and eventually resistance to chemotherapy, including docetaxel. Hence, understanding intratumoral heterogeneity is essential for better patient prognosis and the development of personalized treatment strategies. METHODS: To address this, we employed a high-throughput single-cell flow cytometry approach to identify a specific surface fingerprint associated with docetaxel-resistance in PCa cells and complemented it with proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles. We further validated selected antigens using docetaxel-resistant patient-derived xenografts in vivo and probed primary PCa specimens to interrogate of their surface fingerprint. RESULTS: Our approaches revealed a 6-molecule surface fingerprint linked to docetaxel resistance in primary PCa specimens. We observed consistent overexpression of CD95 (FAS/APO-1), and SSEA-4 surface antigens in both in vitro and in vivo docetaxel-resistant models, which was also observed in a cell subpopulation of primary PCa tumors exhibiting EMT features. Furthermore, CD95, along with the essential enzymes involved in SSEA-4 synthesis, ST3GAL1, and ST3GAL2, displayed a significant increase in patients with PCa undergoing docetaxel-based therapy, correlating with poor survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrate that the identified 6-molecule surface fingerprint associated with docetaxel resistance pre-exists in a subpopulation of primary PCa tumors before docetaxel treatment. Thus, this fingerprint warrants further validation as a promising predictive tool for docetaxel resistance in PCa patients prior to therapy initiation."
39162974,"Exploring the relationship between ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer.","Chronic systemic inflammation caused by diseases such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent evidence indicates that patients with UC are more susceptible to prostate cancer (PCa), and individuals with PCa may also be at a higher risk of developing CRC. However, these relationships are not well defined. A better understanding of this phenomenon could improve the identification of high-risk populations. In this study, we characterized these relationships with experiments using preclinical mouse models of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis (DSS-UC) and DSS/azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CRC (DSS/AOM-CRC) in wild-type and conditional transgenic mice of PCa. We showed that DSS-induced UC was more severe in mice with PCa and resulted in the development of CRC in the absence of AOM. We further showed that PCa-free mice that developed DSS-induced UC also showed histological changes in the normal prostate that resembled proliferative inflammatory atrophy. Finally, we used immunohistochemical immune profiling to show that mice with PCa-induced chronic systemic inflammation accumulated Gr1(+) myeloid cells in the normal colon and exposure to DSS further enriched these cells in active colitis regions and colon tumors. Our study provides evidence to support a link between systemic chronic inflammation and cancer."
39162634,Quantitative (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET and Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Following (177)Lu-PSMA-617 (VISION Trial).,"Background Lutetium 177 [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 ((177)Lu-PSMA-617) is a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Quantitative PSMA PET/CT analysis could provide information on (177)Lu-PSMA-617 treatment benefits. Purpose To explore the association between quantitative baseline gallium 68 [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 ((68)Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT parameters and treatment response and outcomes in the VISION trial. Materials and Methods This was an exploratory secondary analysis of the VISION trial. Eligible participants were randomized (June 2018 to October 2019) in a 2:1 ratio to (177)Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for up to six cycles) plus standard of care (SOC) or to SOC only. Baseline (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET parameters, including the mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(mean) and SUV(max)), PSMA-positive tumor volume, and tumor load, were extracted from five anatomic regions and the whole body. Associations of quantitative PET parameters with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and prostate-specific antigen response were investigated using univariable and multivariable analyses (with treatment as the only other covariate). Outcomes were assessed in subgroups based on SUV(mean) quartiles. Results Quantitative PET parameters were well balanced between study arms for the 826 participants included. The median whole-body tumor SUV(mean) was 7.6 (IQR, 5.8-9.9). Whole-body tumor SUV(mean) was the best predictor of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 efficacy, with a hazard ratio (HR) range of 0.86-1.43 for all outcomes (all P < .001). A 1-unit whole-body tumor SUV(mean) increase was associated with a 12% and 10% decrease in risk of an rPFS event and death, respectively. (177)Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC prolonged rPFS and OS in all SUV(mean) quartiles versus SOC only, with no identifiable optimum among participants receiving (177)Lu-PSMA-617. Higher baseline PSMA-positive tumor volume and tumor load were associated with worse rPFS (HR range, 1.44-1.53 [P < .05] and 1.02-1.03 [P < .001], respectively) and OS (HR range, 1.36-2.12 [P < .006] and 1.04 [P < .001], respectively). Conclusion Baseline (68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT whole-body tumor SUV(mean) was the best predictor of (177)Lu-PSMA-617 efficacy in participants in the VISION trial. Improvements in rPFS and OS with (177)Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC were greater among participants with higher whole-body tumor SUV(mean), with evidence for benefit at all SUV(mean) levels.

39162297,Epigenome-wide association study of prostate cancer in African American men identified differentially methylated genes.,"INTRODUCTION: Men with African ancestry have the highest incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide. METHODS: This study aimed to identify differentially methylated genes between tumor vs. adjacent normal and aggressive vs. indolent PCa in 121 African American patients. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tumor DNA were assessed using the human Illumina Methylation EPIC V1 array. RESULTS: Around 5,139 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.01, lDeltabetal > 0.2) were identified when comparing normal vs. tumor, with an overall trend of hypermethylation in prostate tumors.  Multiple representative differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including immune-related genes, such as CD40, Galectin3, OX40L, and STING, were detected in prostate tumors when compared to adjacent normal tissues. Based on an epigenetic clock model, we observed that tumors' total number of stem cell divisions and the stem cell division rate were significantly higher than adjacent normal tissues. Regarding PCa aggressiveness, 2,061 differentially methylated CpG-sites (q < 0.05, lDeltabetal > .05) were identified when the grade group (GG)1 was compared with GG4/5. Among these 2,061 CpG sites, 155 probes were consistently significant in more than one comparison. Among these genes, several immune system genes, such as COL18A1, S100A2, ITGA4, HLA-C, and ADCYAP1, have previously been linked to tumor progression in PCa. CONCLUSION: Several differentially methylated genes involved in immune-oncologic pathways associated with disease risk or aggressiveness were identified. In addition, 261 African American-specific differentially methylated genes related to the risk of PCa were identified. These results can shedlight on potential mechanisms contributing to PCa disparities in the African American Population."
39161322,Body Mass Index and Risk of Female Reproductive System Tumors Subtypes: A Meta-Analysis Using Mendelian Randomization.,"Introduction: A strong association was previously established between body mass index (BMI) and female reproductive system tumors; however, the causal relationship is unclear. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to further explore this association. Methods: Genetic information for BMI was retrieved from a published genome-wide association study involving 339,224 participants. Genetic associations with five common female reproductive system tumors were obtained from the FinnGen, UK Biobank studies, and other large consortia. Results: Genetic predisposition towards BMI exhibits a significant association with multiple tumors of the female reproductive system. Specifically, for every 1-unit increase in BMI log-transformed odds ratio (OR). The OR fluctuations overall for patients with breast cancer ranged from 0.661 to 0.996 (95% confidence interval [CI],0.544-1.000, P < 0.05). When stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status, the OR for patients with ER (+) breast cancer ranged from 0.782 to 0.844 (95% CI, 0.616-0.994, P < 0.05) and that for those with ER (-) breast cancer ranged from 0.663 to 0.789 (95% CI, 0.498-0.991, P < 0.05). Additionally, ORs were as follows for cancer types: 1.577-1.908 (95% CI, 1.049-2.371, P < 0.05) for endometrial carcinoma; 1.216-1.303 (95% CI, 1.021-1.591, P < 0.05) for high-grade serous ovarian cancer; 1.217 (95% CI, 1.034-1.432, P < 0.05) for low-grade malignant serous ovarian cancer; and 1.502 (95% CI, 1.112-2.029, P < 0.05) for endometrioid ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, our findings indicated that genetic predisposition towards BMI did not exhibit a causal association with uterine fibroids, cervical precancerous lesions, or cervical cancer itself. Conclusion: A genetic association was established between a high BMI and high risk of developing multiple tumors of the female reproductive system and their associated subtypes. This underscores the significance of taking measures to prevent reproductive system tumors in women who have a high BMI."
39159706,Unveiling the impact of circulating tumor cells: Two decades of discovery and clinical advancements in solid tumors.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enumeration and molecular profiling hold promise in revolutionizing the management of solid tumors. Their understanding has evolved significantly over the past two decades, encompassing pivotal biological discoveries and clinical studies across various malignancies. While for some tumor types, such as breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, CTCs are ready to enter clinical practice, for others, additional research is required. CTCs serve as versatile biomarkers, offering insights into tumor biology, metastatic progression, and treatment response. This review summarizes the latest advancements in CTC research and highlights future directions of investigation. Special attention is given to concurrent evaluations of CTCs and other circulating biomarkers, particularly circulating tumor DNA. Multi-analyte assessment holds the potential to unlock the full clinical capabilities of liquid biopsy. In conclusion, CTCs represent a transformative biomarker in precision oncology, offering extraordinary opportunities to translate scientific discoveries into tangible improvements in patient care."
39158464,Assessing sociodemographic and regional disparities in Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score uptake.,"BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (ODX-GPS) is a gene expression assay that predicts disease aggressiveness. The objective of this study was to identify sociodemographic and regional factors associated with ODX-GPS uptake. METHODS: Data from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registries on men with localized prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, PSA </=20 ng/mL, and stage T1c to T2c disease from 2013 through 2017 were linked with ODX-GPS data. Census-tract level neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) quintiles were constructed using a composite socioeconomic score. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of ODX-GPS uptake with age at diagnosis, race and ethnicity, nSES, geographic region, insurance type, and marital status, accounting for National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group, year of diagnosis, and clustering by census tract. RESULTS: Among 111,434 eligible men, 5.5% had ODX-GPS test uptake. Of these, 78.3% were non-Hispanic White, 9.6% were Black, 6.7% were Hispanic, and 3.6% were Asian American. Black men had the lowest odds of ODX-GPS uptake (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.76). Those in the highest versus lowest quintile of nSES were 1.64 times more likely (95% CI, 1.38-2.94) to have ODX-GPS uptake. The odds of ODX-GPS uptake were statistically significantly higher among men residing in the Northeast, West, and Midwest compared to the South. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in ODX-GPS uptake by race, ethnicity, nSES, and geographical region were identified. Concerted efforts should be made to ensure that this clinical test is equitably available."
39158404,Upgrading of Grade Group 1 Prostate Cancer at Prostatectomy: Germline Risk Factors in a Prospective Cohort.,"BACKGROUND: Localized prostate tumors show significant spatial heterogeneity, with regions of high-grade disease adjacent to lower grade disease. Consequently, prostate cancer biopsies are prone to sampling bias, potentially leading to underestimation of tumor grade. To study the clinical, epidemiologic, and molecular hallmarks of this phenomenon, we conducted a prospective study of grade upgrading: differences in detected prostate cancer grade between biopsy and surgery. METHODS: We established a prospective, multi-institutional cohort of men with grade group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer on biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy. Upgrading was defined as detection of GG2+ in the resected tumor. Germline DNA from 192 subjects was subjected to whole-genome sequencing to quantify ancestry, pathogenic variants in DNA damage response genes, and polygenic risk. RESULTS: Of 285 men, 67% upgraded at surgery. PSA density and percent of cancer in pre-prostatectomy positive biopsy cores were significantly associated with upgrading. No assessed genetic risk factor was predictive of upgrading, including polygenic risk scores for prostate cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with low-grade prostate cancer, a majority upgraded at radical prostatectomy. PSA density and percent of cancer in pre-prostatectomy positive biopsy cores portended the presence of higher-grade disease, while germline genetics was not informative in this setting. Patients with low-risk prostate cancer, but elevated PSA density or percent cancer in positive biopsy cores, may benefit from repeat biopsy, additional imaging or other approaches to complement active surveillance. IMPACT: Further risk stratification of patients with low-risk prostate cancer may provide useful context for active surveillance decision-making."
39156730,HPV16 Genomes: In Silico Analysis of E6 and E7 Oncoproteins in 20 South American Variants.,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for the development of squamous cell cervical cancer, and E6 oncoprotein and E7 oncoprotein are important components of the viral genome and its oncogenic potential. It is known that different viral variants of HPV16 have different pathology and impact on the development of neoplasia, although few studies have been performed on South American variants. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze in silico the genomic diversity of HPV16 in 20 complete genome variants of South America in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. METHODS: We performed a descriptive study to characterize the polymorphic regions of the E6 and E7 genes in HPV16 variants, using software for genomic data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and others for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The variants analyzed included six SNPs linked to cancer (A131G, G145T, C335T, T350G, C712A, and T732C) and significant variation (798 nucleotide substitutions). Despite this, the variants showed low genetic diversity. Eighteen variants of unclear significance (VUS) were identified, 10 of which were in the coding E6 regions and 8 in the coding E7 regions. The prevalence of lineage D variants is of concern due to their pathology in cervical cancer and requires more research and epidemiological vigilance regarding their prevalence in the population. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study may contribute to future research on South American variants of HPV16, their pathogenicity, and the development of treatments."
39156700,Combined strategies with PARP inhibitors for the treatment of BRCA wide type cancer.,"Genomic instability stands out as a pivotal hallmark of cancer, and PARP inhibitors (PARPi) emerging as a groundbreaking class of targeted therapy drugs meticulously crafted to inhibit the repair of DNA single-strand breaks(SSB) in tumor cells. Currently, PARPi have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer characterized by homologous recombination(HR) repair deficiencies due to mutations in BRCA1/2 or other DNA repair associated genes and acquiring the designation of breakthrough therapy. Nonetheless, PARPi exhibit limited efficacy in the majority of HR-proficient BRCA1/2 wild-type cancers. At present, the synergistic approach of combining PARPi with agents that induce HR defects, or with chemotherapy and radiotherapy to induce substantial DNA damage, significantly enhances the efficacy of PARPi in BRCA wild-type or HR-proficient patients, supporting extension the use of PARPi in HR proficient patients. Therefore, we have summarized the effects and mechanisms of the combined use of drugs with PARPi, including the combination of PARPi with HR defect-inducing drugs such as ATRi, CHKi, HR indirectly inducing drugs like VEGFRi, CDKi, immune checkpoint inhibitors and drugs instigating DNA damage such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In addition, this review discusses several ongoing clinical trials aimed at analyzing the clinical application potential of these combined treatment strategies."
39155404,Combination therapy with paclitaxel and trastuzumab for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive recurrent serous carcinoma of the uterine cervix: A case report.,"Recent studies show increased expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cervical cancer, but the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy remains under-researched. Here, we present a case of recurrent HER2-positive serous carcinoma, presumably arising in the cervix, diagnosed by comprehensive genomic profiling, which responded to trastuzumab. The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy with concurrent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. One year after surgery, the patient experienced recurrence (multiple lymph node metastases). She underwent chemotherapy and subsequent comprehensive genomic profiling, which revealed HER2 positivity. Despite treatment, the lymph node and peritoneal metastases progressed. Therefore, combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated. Subsequently, the patient's clinical symptoms improved considerably, and good health was maintained for 8 months. This report highlights the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling and targeted therapies when standard treatments fail."
39155209,Should Only Patients with BRCA Mutation Be Treated with a Combination of an Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitor and a PARP Inhibitor for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer? The Answer Is No.,"Patients who benefit the most from combinations of an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and a PARP inhibitor are those with a BRCA mutation, but there are certainly patients without BRCA mutations who will benefit from this treatment strategy."
39154329,HPV-16 E6 mutation and viral integration related host DNA methylation implicate the development and progression of cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: HPV-16 infection and viral-host integration are the most important risk factors for cervical cancer (CC). The aim of this study is to develop a new molecular strategy integrated both the viral and host genome variations identifying and monitoring CC. METHOD: A total of 312 methylation and 538 RNA-seq datasets were collected from public databases to identify differentially methylated and expressed genes. HPV associated virus integration sites (VISs) were analysed using the ViMIC database. From September 2020 to August 2021, the 70 HPV-16 positive cases retrospectively collected from multi-centre cohorts were subjected to HPV-16 E6 deep sequencing and PCR-based host gene (ASTN1, DLX1, ITGA4, RXFP3, SOX17, ZNF671) methylation detection. RNAseq and expression validation (NNF671) were performed in C-33A cell line harbouring HPV D32E. Lasso and logistic regression algorithm were used to construct the CC diagnostic model. RESULTS: A positive correlation was observed between the average methylation level of CC patients and their pathological features including tumour stage (p = 0.0077) and HPV subtype (p < 0.001). ZNF671 was identified as a CC-specific methylation marker, with an impressive 93% sensitivity. Both HPV-16 D32E mutation and integration of HPV-16 down-regulated the ZNF671 expression. Finally, a CC diagnostic nomogram was developed by integrating ZNF671 methylation level and HPV E6 mutation feature, yielding an exceptional AUC of 0.997 (95% CI: 0.934-1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated HPV viral mutations are closely related to host gene epigenetic alterations in CC. Integration of the viral and host genetic information might be a new promising strategy for CC screening."
39154284,Modern predictors and management of incidental prostate cancer at holmium enucleation of prostate.,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate contemporary preoperative risk factors and subsequent postoperative management of incidental prostate cancer (iPCa) and incidental clinically significant prostate cancer (icsPCa, Grade Group [GG] >/= 2 PCa). METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 811 men undergoing Holmium enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) (January 2021-July 2022) were identified. Advanced preoperative testing was defined as prostate health index (PHI), prostate MRI, and/or negative preoperative biopsy. Descriptive statistics (Whitney-Mann U test, Chi-squared test) and multivariable logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: iPCa and icsPCa detection rates were 12.8% (104/811) and 4.4% (36/811), respectively. Advanced preoperative testing (406/811, 50%) was associated with younger age and higher (prostate specific antigen) PSA, prostate volume, and PSA density. On multivariable analysis, PHI >/= 55 was associated with iPCa (OR 6.91, 95% CI 1.85-26.3, p = 0.004), and % free PSA (%fPSA) was associated with icsPCa (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67, 0.94, p = 0.01). GG1 disease comprised the majority of iPCa (65%, 68/104) with median 1% involvement. iPCa patients were followed with active surveillance (median follow up 9.3 months), with higher risk patients receiving prostate MRI and confirmatory biopsy. Three patients proceeded to radical prostatectomy or radiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the era of MRI and advanced biomarkers, the majority of iPCa following HoLEP is low volume GG1 suitable for active surveillance. A tentative follow-up strategy is proposed. Patients with PHI >/= 55 or low %fPSA, even with negative prostate MRI, can consider preoperative prostate biopsy before HoLEP."
39154046,Elucidating the pan-oncologic landscape of S100A9: prognostic and therapeutic corollaries from an integrative bioinformatics and Mendelian randomization analysis.,"The calcium-binding protein S100A9 has emerged as a pivotal biomolecular actor in oncology, implicated in numerous malignancies. This comprehensive bioinformatics study transcends traditional boundaries, investigating the prognostic and therapeutic potential of S100A9 across diverse neoplastic entities. Leveraging a wide array of bioinformatics tools and publicly available cancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, we systematically examined the S100A9 gene. Our approach included differential expression analysis, mutational burden assessment, protein interaction networks, and survival analysis. This robust computational framework provided a high-resolution view of S100A9's role in cancer biology. The study meticulously explored S100A9's oncogenic facets, incorporating comprehensive analyses of its relationship with prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and immune cell infiltration across various tumor types. This study presents a panoramic view of S100A9 expression across a spectrum of human cancers, revealing a heterogeneous expression landscape. Elevated S100A9 expression was detected in malignancies such as BLCA (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma), CESC (Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma), COAD (Colon adenocarcinoma), ESCA (Esophageal carcinoma), and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme), while reduced expression was noted in BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma), HNSC (Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma), and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe). This disparate expression pattern suggests that S100A9's role in cancer biology is multifaceted and context-dependent. Prognostically, S100A9 expression correlates variably with patient outcomes across different cancer types. Furthermore, its expression is intricately associated with TMB and MSI in nine cancer types. Detailed examination of six selected tumors-BRCA, CESC, KIRC (Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma), LUSC (Lung squamous cell carcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma); STAD (Stomach adenocarcinoma)-revealed a negative correlation of S100A9 expression with the infiltration of most immune cells, but a positive correlation with neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells, highlighting the complex interplay between S100A9 and the tumor immune environment. This bioinformatics synthesis posits S100A9 as a significant player in cancer progression, offering valuable prognostic insights. The data underscore the utility of S100A9 as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. The therapeutic implications are profound, suggesting that modulation of S100A9 activity could significantly impact cancer management strategies."
39153780,How a population-based cohort of men estimate lifetime risk of prostate cancer in a survey before entering a prostate cancer screening trial in Sweden?,"OBJECTIVES: Investigating men's perceived lifetime risk of prostate cancer. DESIGN: Survey-based study to men invited for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the GOTEBORG-2 trial between September 2015 and June 2020. SETTING: 38 775 men in the Gothenburg area, Sweden, were invited for PSA-testing and participated in a survey. PARTICIPANTS: 17 980 men participated in PSA-testing, of whom 13 189 completed the survey. In addition, 1264 men answered the survey only. INTERVENTIONS: Before having the PSA-test, men answered an electronic survey and estimated their lifetime risk of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis on a visual analogue scale from 0% to 100%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the median lifetime risk estimation, which was compared with Wilcoxon test to an anticipated lifetime risk of 20% (based on GOTEBORG-1 trial). The secondary outcome was to determine factors associated with risk estimation in a multivariable linear regression model: previous prostate examination, family history, physical exercise, healthy diet, comorbidity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education level, marital status, urinary symptoms and erectile dysfunction. RESULTS: Among PSA-tested men, the median estimated lifetime risk of prostate cancer was 30% (IQR 19% to 50%), corresponding to a 10 percentage-points higher estimation compared with the anticipated risk (p<0.001). Family history of prostate cancer, moderate to severe urinary symptoms and mild to moderate erectile dysfunction were associated with >5 percentage-points higher risk estimation. Similar results were obtained for non-PSA-tested men. CONCLUSIONS: Most men overestimated their prostate cancer risk which underscores the importance of providing them accurate information about prostate cancer. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN94604465."
39153303,Integrated structural proteomics and machine learning-guided mapping of a highly protective precision vaccine against mycoplasma pulmonis.,"Mycoplasma pulmonis (M. pulmonis) is an emerging respiratory infection commonly linked to prostate cancer, and it is classified under the group of mycoplasmas. Improved management of mycoplasma infections is essential due to the frequent ineffectiveness of current antibiotic treatments in completely eliminating these pathogens from the host. The objective of this study is to design and construct effective and protective vaccines guided by structural proteomics and machine learning algorithms to provide protection against the M. pulmonis infection. Through a thorough examination of the entire proteome of M. pulmonis, four specific targets Membrane protein P80, Lipoprotein, Uncharacterized protein and GGDEF domain-containing protein have been identified as appropriate for designing a vaccine. The proteins underwent mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL) (IFN)-gamma +/-, and B-cell epitopes using artificial and recurrent neural networks. The design involved the creation of mRNA and peptide-based vaccine, which consisted of 8 CTL epitopes associated by GGS linkers, 7 HTL (IFN-positive) epitopes, and 8 B-cell epitopes joined by GPGPG linkers. The vaccine designed exhibit antigenic behavior, non-allergenic qualities, and exceptional physicochemical attributes. Structural modeling revealed that correct folding is crucial for optimal functioning. The coupling of the MEVC and Toll-like Receptors (TLR)1, TLR2, and TLR6 was examined through molecular docking experiments. This was followed by molecular simulation investigations, which included binding free energy estimations. The results indicated that the dynamics of the interaction were stable, and the binding was strong. In silico cloning and optimization analysis revealed an optimized sequence with a GC content of 49.776 % and a CAI of 0.982. The immunological simulation results showed strong immune responses, with elevated levels of active and plasma B-cells, regulatory T-cells, HTL, and CTL in both IgM+IgG and secondary immune responses. The antigen was completely cleared by the 50th day. This study lays the foundation for creating a potent and secure vaccine candidate to combat the newly identified M. pulmonis infection in people."
39153107,Identification of prostate cancer associated genes for diagnosis and prognosis: a modernized in silico approach.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Diagnosing PCa relies on molecular markers known as diagnostic biomarkers, while prognostic biomarkers are used to identify key proteins involved in PCa treatments. This study aims to gather PCa-associated genes and assess their potential as either diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for PCa. A corpus of 152,064 PCa-related data from PubMed, spanning from May 1936 to December 2020, was compiled. Additionally, 4199 genes associated with PCa terms were collected from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The PubMed corpus data was extracted using pubmed.mineR to identify PCa-associated genes. Network and pathway analyses were conducted using various tools, such as STRING, DAVID, KEGG, MCODE 2.0, cytoHubba app, CluePedia, and ClueGO app. Significant marker genes were identified using Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Network algorithms, and the Cox Proportional Hazard model. This study reports 3062 unique PCa-associated genes along with 2518 corresponding unique PMIDs. Diagnostic markers such as IL6, MAPK3, JUN, FOS, ACTB, MYC, and TGFB1 were identified, while prognostic markers like ACTB and HDAC1 were highlighted in PubMed. This suggests that the potential target genes provided by PubMed data outweigh those in the NCBI database."
39150969,Circum-Mediterranean influence in the Y-chromosome lineages associated with prostate cancer in Mexican men: A Converso heritage founder effect?,"Prostate cancer is the second most common neoplasia amongst men worldwide. Hereditary susceptibility and ancestral heritage are well-established risk factors that explain the disparity trends across different ethnicities, populations, and regions even within the same country. The Y-chromosome has been considered a prototype biomarker for male health. African, European, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic ancestries exhibit the highest incidences of such neoplasia; Asians have the lowest rates. Nonetheless, the contribution of ancestry patterns has been scarcely explored among Latino males. The Mexican population has an extremely diverse genetic architecture where all the aforementioned ancestral backgrounds converge. Trans-ethnic research could illuminate the aetiology of prostate cancer, involving the migratory patterns, founder effects, and the ethnic contributions to its disparate incidence rates. The contribution of the ancestral heritage to prostate cancer risk were explored through a case-control study (152 cases and 372 controls) study in Mexican Mestizo males. Seventeen microsatellites were used to trace back the ancestral heritage using two Bayesian predictor methods. The lineage R1a seems to contribute to prostate cancer (ORadjusted:8.04, 95%CI:1.41-45.80) development, whereas E1b1a/E1b1b and GHIJ contributed to well-differentiated (Gleason </= 7), and late-onset prostate cancer. Meta-analyses reinforced our findings. The mentioned lineages exhibited a connection with the Middle Eastern and North African populations that enriched the patrilineal diversity to the southeast region of the Iberian Peninsula. This ancestral legacy arrived at the New World with the Spanish and Sephardim migrations. Our findings reinforced the contribution of family history and ethnic background to prostate cancer risk, although should be confirmed using a large sample size. Nonetheless, given its complex aetiology, in addition to the genetic component, the lifestyle and xenobiotic exposition could also influence the obtained results."
39149513,The extracellular matrix component perlecan/HSPG2 regulates radioresistance in prostate cancer cells.,"Radiotherapy of prostate cancer (PC) can lead to the acquisition of radioresistance through molecular mechanisms that involve, in part, cell adhesion-mediated signaling. To define these mechanisms, we employed a DU145 PC model to conduct a comparative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the purified integrin nexus, i.e., the cell-matrix junction where integrins bridge assembled extracellular matrix (matrisome components) to adhesion signaling complexes (adhesome components). When parental and radioresistant cells were compared, the expression of integrins was not changed, but cell radioresistance was associated with extensive matrix remodeling and changes in the complement of adhesion signaling proteins. Out of 72 proteins differentially expressed in the parental and radioresistant cells, four proteins were selected for functional validation based on their correlation with biochemical recurrence-free survival. Perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) and lysyl-like oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) were upregulated, while sushi repeat-containing protein X-linked (SRPX) and laminin subunit beta 3 (LAMB3) were downregulated in radioresistant DU145 cells. Knockdown of perlecan/HSPG2 sensitized radioresistant DU145 RR cells to irradiation while the sensitivity of DU145 parental cells did not change, indicating a potential role for perlecan/HSPG2 and its associated proteins in suppressing tumor radioresistance. Validation in androgen-sensitive parental and radioresistant LNCaP cells further supported perlecan/HSPG2 as a regulator of cell radiosensitivity. These findings extend our understanding of the interplay between extracellular matrix remodeling and PC radioresistance and signpost perlecan/HSPG2 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for PC."
39148652,"A real-world, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study on high-risk human papillomavirus genotype distribution in 31,942 women in Dongguan, China.","BACKGROUND: Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection remains a key risk factor for cervical cancer. HPV-based primary screening is widely recommended in clinical guidelines, and further longitudinal studies are needed to optimize strategies for detecting high-grade cervical lesions compared to cytology. METHODS: From November 2015 to December 2023, 31,942 participants were included in the real-world observational study. Among those, 4,219 participants underwent at least two rounds of HPV tests, and 397 completed three rounds of HPV tests. All participants were tested for high-risk types of HPV 16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/66/68 (hrHPV) and low-risk types of HPV6/11 genotyping. Some participants also received cytology or colposcopy with pathology. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional cohort, the prevalence of hrHPV and all HPV subtypes was 6.6% (2,108/31,942) and 6.8% (2,177/31,942), respectively. The three top hrHPV genotypes were HPV52 (1.9%), HPV58 (0.9%), and HPV16 (0.9%). Age distributions showed two peaks at 45-49 and 60-65 years. For the primary screening cohort, the hrHPV prevalence rate increased from 4.8% in 2015-2017 to 7.0% in 2020-2020 and finally reached 7.2% in 2023. For the longitudinal cohort study, the hrHPV prevalence rates in the repeated population (3.9, 5.3, and 6.0%) were lower than the primary hrHPV screening rates (6.6%), which indicated that repeated screening might decrease the prevalence rate. Methodologically, the hrHPV (89.5%) and the screening group of 16 subtypes (92.3%) demonstrated superior sensitivity than the cytology group (54.4%). Moreover, the longitudinal study indicated that the persistent hrHPV subgroup had a significantly higher (p = 0.04) incidence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and more histology progression events (7/17 vs. 0/5) than the reinfection group. CONCLUSION: The study indicates a rising high-risk HPV prevalence in Dongguan, with repeated screening reducing this trend. The findings support HPV-based primary screening and might guide HPV vaccination and cervical cancer prevention in South China."
39148266,Extracellular vesicles carry transcriptional 'dark matter' revealing tissue-specific information.,"From eukaryotes to prokaryotes, all cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) as part of their regular homeostasis, intercellular communication, and cargo disposal. Accumulating evidence suggests that small EVs carry functional small RNAs, potentially serving as extracellular messengers and liquid-biopsy markers. Yet, the complete transcriptomic landscape of EV-associated small RNAs during disease progression is poorly delineated due to critical limitations including the protocols used for sequencing, suboptimal alignment of short reads (20-50 nt), and uncharacterized genome annotations-often denoted as the 'dark matter' of the genome. In this study, we investigate the EV-associated small unannotated RNAs that arise from endogenous genes and are part of the genomic 'dark matter', which may play a key emerging role in regulating gene expression and translational mechanisms. To address this, we created a distinct small RNAseq dataset from human prostate cancer & benign tissues, and EVs derived from blood (pre- & post-prostatectomy), urine, and human prostate carcinoma epithelial cell line. We then developed an unsupervised data-based bioinformatic pipeline that recognizes biologically relevant transcriptional signals irrespective of their genomic annotation. Using this approach, we discovered distinct EV-RNA expression patterns emerging from the un-annotated genomic regions (UGRs) of the transcriptomes associated with tissue-specific phenotypes. We have named these novel EV-associated small RNAs as 'EV-UGRs' or ""EV-dark matter"". Here, we demonstrate that EV-UGR gene expressions are downregulated by  approximately 100 fold (FDR < 0.05) in the circulating serum EVs from aggressive prostate cancer subjects. Remarkably, these EV-UGRs expression signatures were regained (upregulated) after radical prostatectomy in the same follow-up patients. Finally, we developed a stem-loop RT-qPCR assay that validated prostate cancer-specific EV-UGRs for selective fluid-based diagnostics. Overall, using an unsupervised data driven approach, we investigate the 'dark matter' of EV-transcriptome and demonstrate that EV-UGRs carry tissue-specific Information that significantly alters pre- and post-prostatectomy in the prostate cancer patients. Although further validation in randomized clinical trials is required, this new class of EV-RNAs hold promise in liquid-biopsy by avoiding highly invasive biopsy procedures in prostate cancer."
39147845,Long noncoding RNA EPCART regulates translation through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and PDCD4 in prostate cancer.,"While hundreds of cancer-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered, their functional role in cancer cells is still largely a mystery. An increasing number of lncRNAs are recognized to function in the cytoplasm, e.g., as modulators of translation. Here, we investigated the detailed molecular identity and functional role of EPCART, a lncRNA we previously discovered to be a potential oncogene in prostate cancer (PCa). First, we interrogated the transcript structure of EPCART and then confirmed EPCART to be a non-peptide-coding lncRNA using in silico methods. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed protein-coding genes in EPCART knockout cells implied that EPCART modulates the translational machinery of PCa cells. EPCART was also largely located in the cytoplasm and at the sites of translation. With quantitative proteome analysis on EPCART knockout cells we discovered PDCD4, an inhibitor of protein translation, to be increased by EPCART reduction. Further studies indicated that the inhibitory effect of EPCART silencing on translation was mediated by reduced activation of AKT and inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway. Together, our findings identify EPCART as a translation-associated lncRNA that functions via modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway in PCa cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the prognostic potential of PDCD4 in PCa tumors in connection with EPCART."
39147115,Unraveling novel mRNA transcripts of the human DNA N-glycosylase 1 (NTHL1) gene with the implementation of an innovative targeted DNA-seq assay.,"The human NTHL1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase that plays a key role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, repairing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genome integrity. The physiological activity of NTHL1 is crucial in preventing genetic alterations that can lead to cancer. In this study, we employed an innovative targeted DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) methodology to explore the transcriptional landscape of the NTHL1 gene, revealing previously uncharacterized alternative splicing events and novel exons. Our designed approach provided significantly improved sequencing depth and coverage, enabling the identification of novel NTHL1 mRNA transcripts. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed all annotated splice junctions of the main NTHL1 transcripts (v.1 - v.3) and revealed novel mRNA transcripts (NTHL1 v.4 - v.9) derived from splicing events between annotated exons as well as mRNAs containing previously uncharacterized exons (NTHL1 v.10 - v.14). Quantitative PCR analysis highlighted a diverse expression pattern of these novel transcripts across different human cell lines, suggesting cell-specific roles and regulatory mechanisms. Notably, NTHL1 v.5 was overexpressed in luminal A breast cancer cells (MCF-7), while v.13 was prominent in triple negative (BT-20), HER2 + breast cancer (SK-BR-3), prostate, colorectal cancer cells and HEK-293 cells. Our findings suggest that specific novel NTHL1 transcripts may encode protein isoforms with distinct structural features, as indicated by ribosome profiling datasets, while others containing premature termination codons could function as long non-coding RNAs. These insights enhance our understanding of NTHL1 regulatory role and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in human malignancies. This study underscores the importance of exploring the transcriptional diversity of NTHL1 to fully elucidate its role in cancer pathobiology."
39145078,Identification and validation of ferroptosis-related prognostic gene signature in patients with cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death, which is distinct from the other types of regulated cell death. Considerable studies have demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in the biological process of various cancers. However, the role of ferroptosis in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. This study aims to explore the ferroptosis-related prognostic genes (FRPGs) expression profiles and their prognostic values in CC. METHODS: The ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and FerrDb databases. Core FRGs were determined by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) website. FRPGs were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regressions, and the ferroptosis-related prognostic model was constructed. FRPGs were verified in clinical specimens. The relationship between FRPGs and tumor infiltrating immune cells were assessed through the CIBERSORT algorithm and the LM22 signature matrix. Bioinformatics functions of FRPGs were explored with the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). RESULTS: Thirty-three significantly up-regulated and 28 down-regulated FRGs were screened from databases [P<0.05; false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05; and |log(2) fold change (FC)| >/=2]. Twenty-four genes were found closely interacting with each other and regarded as hub genes (degree >/=3). Solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1), carbonic anhydrases IX (CA9), and dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1) were identified as independent prognostic signatures for overall survival (OS) in a Cox regression. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed the predictive ability of the ferroptosis-related prognostic model, especially for 1-year OS [area under the curve (AUC) =0.76]. Consistent with the public data, our experiments demonstrated that the mRNA levels of SLC2A1 and DUOX1, and the protein levels of SLC2A1, DUOX1, and CA9 were significantly higher in the tumor tissues. Further analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the proportion of tumor infiltrating immune cells between the low- and high-risk group based on our prognostic model. The function enrichment of FRPGs was explored by applying Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the features of FRPGs in CC were pictured. The results implicated that targeting ferroptosis may be a new reliable biomarker and an alternative therapy for CC."
39145061,"Characteristics, clinical significance, and cancer immune interactions of lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.","BACKGROUND: The relationship between lipid metabolism, immune response, and immunotherapy in prostate cancer (PCa) is closely intertwined, and targeted intervention in lipid metabolism may facilitate the success of anticancer immunotherapy. This research attempted to explore effective immunotherapy for PCa. METHODS: We obtained RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for PCa patients from the UCSC Xena platform. Data analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using package limma in R. Then, DEGs were subjected to enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database was conducted to validate the protein expression of the up-regulated lipid metabolism related genes (LMRGs) between PCa tissues and normal prostate tissues. And then we identified critical transcription factors (TFs), LMRGs and miRNA by constructing a regulatory network of TF-gene-miRNA. Furthermore, we determined the high and low groups based on the score of lipid metabolism enrichment. The hallmark gene sets were derived from gene expression profiles using the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R package. Finally, we conducted immune infiltration analysis and drug sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Immune response and lipid metabolism have undergone significant changes in PCa and paracancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. A total of 21 LMRGs were differentially up-regulated in PCa. The TF-gene-miRNA network showed that PLA2G7, TWIST1, and TRIB3 may be the key genes that elevated lipid metabolism in PCa. The high group had more infiltration of B cell memory, macrophage M0, macrophage M1, and myeloid dendritic cell resting, and the low group had more infiltration of B cell plasma, monocyte, myeloid dendritic cell activated, and mast cell resting. The majority of checkpoint genes exhibited high expression levels in the low group. Lipid metabolism was remarkedly correlated with drug sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of lipid metabolism and related genes has revealed a complex regulatory mechanism that has a significant influence on immune response, immunotherapy, and medication guidance for patients with PCa. KEYWORDS: Prostate cancer (PCa); lipid metabolism; cancer immune; RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)."
39143552,METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification of circGLIS3 promotes prostate cancer progression and represents a potential target for ARSI therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the role of circGLIS3 (hsa_circ_0002874) in prostate cancer (PCa) has yet not been reported. METHODS: Candidate circRNA were determined through comprehensive analysis of public datasets, PCa cell lines, and tissues data. A series of cellular functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays were performed. Subsequently, RNA sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, microRNA pulldown, luciferase reporter assay, and western blot were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the xenograft tumor mouse model was established to elucidate the function of circGLIS3. RESULTS: CircGLIS3, derived from exon 2 of the parental GLIS3 gene, was identified as a novel oncogenic circRNA in PCa that was closely associated with the biochemical recurrence. Its expression levels were upregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines as well as enzalutamide high-resistant cells. The cellular functional assays revealed that circGLIS3 promoted PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. METTL3-mediated N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification maintained its upregulation by enhancing its stability. Mechanically, CircGLIS3 sponged miR-661 to upregulate MDM2, thus regulating the p53 signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments, the knockdown of circGLIS3 improved the response of PCa cells to ARSI therapies such as enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification of circGLIS3 regulates the p53 signaling pathway via the miR-661/MDM2 axis, thereby facilitating PCa progression. Meanwhile, this study unveils a promising potential target for ARSI therapy for PCa."
39142223,Identification of miRNA signature in cancer-associated fibroblast to predict recurrent prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the major components of prostate stromal cells, which play a crucial part in tumor development and treatment resistance. This study aimed to establish a model of CAFs-related microRNAs (miRNAs) to assess prognostic differences, tumor microenvironments, and screening of anticancer drugs by integrating data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (buRNA-seq). METHODS: scRNA-seq and buRNA-seq data of primary prostate cancer (PCa) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Statistical methods including Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), Lasso penalized, Random Forest, Random Forest Combination, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were performed to select hub miRNAs. Pathway analyses and assessment of infiltrating immune cells were conducted using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and the CIBERSORT algorithm. The expression of CAFs-related miRNAs in fibroblast cell lines were validated through quantitative real-time PCR. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8), wound-healing, clone formation, and cell migration assays were used to explore cell proliferation, growth, and migration in vitro. A mouse xenograft model was established to investigate the effect of CAFs on tumor growth in vivo. RESULTS: Through single-cell transcriptomics analysis in 34 PCa patients, 89 CAFs-related mRNAs were identified. A prognostic model based on 9 CAFs-related miRNAs (hsa-miR-1258, hsa-miR-133b, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-145-3p, hsa-miR-493-5p, hsa-miR-96-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, and hsa-miR-191-5p) was established to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR). We have determined through two prediction methods that NVP-TAE684 may be the optimal targeted therapy drug for treating CAFs. Downregulation of hsa-miR-106b-5p in CAFs significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. In vivo studies using a xenograft model further confirmed that hsa-miR-106b-5p downregulation significantly reduced tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings conducted an integrated bioinformatic analysis to develop a CAFs-related miRNAs model that provides prognostic insights into individualized and precise treatment for prostate adenocarcinoma patients. Downregulation of miR-106b-5p in CAFs significantly suppressed tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
39139341,Comprehensive Analysis Reveals Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor as a Potential Diagnostic Biomarker in Glioblastoma Multiforme.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, is the most common malignant brain tumor and poses a significant risk to life. GBM patients have a low survival rate owing to their aggressive nature, poor prognosis, genomic variations among patients, and histopathological differences. In this study, we used several bioinformatics platforms, namely Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN) databases, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and cBioPortal, to conduct a comprehensive analysis to highlight the expression of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with GBM. Our study highlights EGFR as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. According to the TIMER database, EGFR was upregulated in five cancers, including GBM, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal cell carcinoma, kidney renal cell papillary cell carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, whereas it was downregulated in breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Our investigation highlighted the expression of EGFR in various clinicopathological parameters, which include age, sex, gender, and TP53 mutation status in patients with GBM. We found that EGFR was upregulated in middle-aged and older adults compared to normal tissues, while it was not significantly downregulated in young adults and older adults. EGFR was upregulated in Caucasians compared to normal tissue, whereas it was downregulated in Asian and African American populations, but this was not statistically significant. In terms of gender, EGFR was upregulated in the male population compared to the female population. Furthermore, EGFR was upregulated in patients with TP53 mutations compared to normal tissues. We also examined the correlation between EGFR gene expression and immune cell infiltration in GBM patients and the impact of EGFR mutations on patient prognosis. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between EGFR, B cells, and macrophages, but this was not significant for other cell types. This study signified that upregulation of EGFR was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with GBM validated by the GEPIA and UALCAN databases."
39138796,Amphiregulin Downregulates E-cadherin Expression by Activating YAP/Egr-1/Slug Signaling in SKOV3 Human Ovarian Cancer Cells.,"Amphiregulin (AREG) stimulates human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell invasion by downregulating E-cadherin expression. YAP is a transcriptional cofactor that has been shown to regulate tumorigenesis. This study aimed to examine whether AREG activates YAP in EOC cells and explore the roles of YAP in AREG-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and cell invasion. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that upregulation of AREG and EGFR were associated with poor survival in human EOC. Treatment of SKOV3 human EOC cells with AREG induced the activation of YAP. In addition, AREG downregulated E-cadherin, upregulated Egr-1 and Slug, and stimulated cell invasion. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we showed that YAP was required for the AREG-upregulated Egr-1 and Slug expression. Furthermore, YAP was also involved in AREG-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and cell invasion. This study provides evidence that AREG stimulates human EOC cell invasion by downregulating E-cadherin expression through the YAP/Egr-1/Slug signaling."
39138666,Upregulation of hsa-miR-141-3p promotes uterine cervical carcinoma progression via targeting dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1.,"We aimed to explore the aberrant expression status of hsa-miR-141-3p and dual-specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and their relative mechanisms in uterine cervical carcinoma (UCC).Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted to detect the expression of hsa-miR-141-3p. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to examine the expression of DUSP1 in UCC. Gene chips and RNA-seq datasets were also obtained to assess the expression level. Integrated standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the expression status of hsa-miR-141-3p in UCC tissues comprehensively. DUSP1-overexpression and hsa-miR-141-3p-inhibition HeLa cells were established, and CCK-8, transwell, wound healing, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays were implemented. The targets of hsa-miR-141-3p were obtained with online tools, and the combination of hsa-miR-141-3p and DUSP1 was validated via dual-luciferase reporter assay. Single-cell RNA-seq data were analyzed to explore hsa-miR-141-3p and DUSP1 in different cells. An integrated SMD of 1.41 (95% CI[0.45, 2.38], p = 0.0041) with 558 samples revealed the overexpression of hsa-miR-141-3p in UCC tissues. And the pooled SMD of -1.06 (95% CI[-1.45, -0.66], p < 0.0001) with 1,268 samples indicated the downregulation of DUSP1. Inhibition of hsa-miR-141-3p could upregulate DUSP1 expression and suppress invasiveness and metastasis of HeLa cells. Overexpression of DUSP1 could hamper proliferation, invasion, and migration and boost apoptosis and distribution of G1 phase. The dual-luciferase reporter assay validated the combination of hsa-miR-141-3p and DUSP1. Moreover, the targets of hsa-miR-141-3p were mainly enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway and activated in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The current study illustrated the upregulation of hsa-miR-141-3p and the downregulation of DUSP1 in UCC tissues. Hsa-miR-141-3p could promote UCC progression by targeting DUSP1."
39138470,Exploring the clinical and biological significance of the cell cycle-related gene CHMP4C in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) stands as the second most prevalent malignancy impacting male health, and the disease's evolutionary course presents formidable challenges in the context of patient treatment and prognostic management. Charged multivesicular body protein 4 C (CHMP4C) participates in the development of several cancers by regulating cell cycle functions. However, the role of CHMP4C in prostate cancer remains unclear. METHODS: In terms of bioinformatics, multiple PCa datasets were employed to scrutinize the expression of CHMP4C. Survival analysis coupled with a nomogram approach was employed to probe into the prognostic significance of CHMP4C. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to interrogate the functional implications of CHMP4C. In terms of cellular experimentation, the verification of RNA and protein expression levels was executed through the utilization of qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Upon the establishment of a cell line featuring stable CHMP4C knockdown, a battery of assays, including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, Transwell, and flow cytometry, were employed to discern the impact of CHMP4C on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle function of PCa cells. RESULTS: The expression of CHMP4C exhibited upregulation in both PCa cells and tissues, and patients demonstrating elevated CHMP4C expression levels experienced a notably inferior prognosis. The nomogram, constructed using CHMP4C along with clinicopathological features, demonstrated a commendable capacity for prognostic prediction. CHMP4C knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells (LNcaP and PC3). CHMP4C could impact the advancement of the PCa cell cycle, and its expression might be regulated by berberine. Divergent CHMP4C expression among PCa patients could induce alterations in immune cell infiltration and gene mutation frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CHMP4C might be a prognostic biomarker in PCa, potentially offering novel perspectives for the advancement of precision therapy for PCa."
39137963,Genetics of prostate cancer: a review of latest evidence.,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) is a largely heritable and polygenic disease. It is the most common cancer in people with prostates (PwPs) in Europe and the USA, including in PwPs of African descent. In the UK in 2020, 52% of all cancers were diagnosed at stage I or II. The National Health Service (NHS) long-term plan is to increase this to 75% by 2028, to reduce absolute incidence of late-stage disease. In the absence of a UK PrCa screening programme, we should explore how to identify those at increased risk of clinically significant PrCa.Incorporating genomics into the PrCa screening, diagnostic and treatment pathway has huge potential for transforming patient care. Genomics can increase efficiency of PrCa screening by focusing on those with genetic predisposition to cancer-which when combined with risk factors such as age and ethnicity, can be used for risk stratification in risk-based screening (RBS) programmes. The goal of RBS is to facilitate early diagnosis of clinically significant PrCa and reduce overdiagnosis/overtreatment in those unlikely to experience PrCa-related symptoms in their lifetime. Genetic testing can guide PrCa management, by identifying those at risk of lethal PrCa and enabling access to novel targeted therapies.PrCa is curable if diagnosed below stage III when most people do not experience symptoms. RBS using genetic profiling could be key here if we could show better survival outcomes (or reduction in cancer-specific mortality accounting for lead-time bias), in addition to more cost efficiency than age-based screening alone. Furthermore, PrCa outcomes in underserved communities could be optimised if genetic testing was accessible, minimising health disparities."
39137945,Hyd/UBR5 defines a tumor suppressor pathway that links Polycomb repressive complex to regulated protein degradation in tissue growth control and tumorigenesis.,"Tumor suppressor genes play critical roles in normal tissue homeostasis, and their dysregulation underlies human diseases including cancer. Besides human genetics, model organisms such as Drosophila have been instrumental in discovering tumor suppressor pathways that were subsequently shown to be highly relevant in human cancer. Here we show that hyperplastic disc (Hyd), one of the first tumor suppressors isolated genetically in Drosophila and encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase with hitherto unknown substrates, and Lines (Lin), best known for its role in embryonic segmentation, define an obligatory tumor suppressor protein complex (Hyd-Lin) that targets the zinc finger-containing oncoprotein Bowl for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, with Lin functioning as a substrate adaptor to recruit Bowl to Hyd for ubiquitination. Interestingly, the activity of the Hyd-Lin complex is directly inhibited by a micropeptide encoded by another zinc finger gene, drumstick (drm), which functions as a pseudosubstrate by displacing Bowl from the Hyd-Lin complex, thus stabilizing Bowl. We further identify the epigenetic regulator Polycomb repressive complex1 (PRC1) as a critical upstream regulator of the Hyd-Lin-Bowl pathway by directly repressing the transcription of the micropeptide drm Consistent with these molecular studies, we show that genetic inactivation of Hyd, Lin, or PRC1 resulted in Bowl-dependent hyperplastic tissue overgrowth in vivo. We also provide evidence that the mammalian homologs of Hyd (UBR5, known to be recurrently dysregulated in various human cancers), Lin (LINS1), and Bowl (OSR1/2) constitute an analogous protein degradation pathway in human cells, and that OSR2 promotes prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Altogether, these findings define a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor pathway that links epigenetic program to regulated protein degradation in tissue growth control and tumorigenesis."
39137781,Transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies identify genes associated with renal cell carcinoma.,"We performed a series of integrative analyses including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and proteome-wide association studies (PWASs) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to nominate and prioritize molecular targets for laboratory investigation. On the basis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,020 affected individuals and 835,670 control individuals and prediction models trained in transcriptomic reference models, our TWAS across four kidney transcriptomes (GTEx kidney cortex, kidney tubules, TCGA-KIRC [The Cancer Genome Atlas kidney renal clear-cell carcinoma], and TCGA-KIRP [TCGA kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma]) identified 38 gene associations (false-discovery rate <5%) in at least two of four transcriptomic panels and identified 12 genes that were independent of GWAS susceptibility regions. Analyses combining TWAS associations across 48 tissues from GTEx identified associations that were replicable in tumor transcriptomes for 23 additional genes. Analyses by the two major histologic types (clear-cell RCC and papillary RCC) revealed subtype-specific associations, although at least three gene associations were common to both subtypes. PWAS identified 13 associated proteins, all mapping to GWAS-significant loci. TWAS-identified genes were enriched for active enhancer or promoter regions in RCC tumors and hypoxia-inducible factor binding sites in relevant cell lines. Using gene expression correlation, common cancers (breast and prostate) and RCC risk factors (e.g., hypertension and BMI) display genetic contributions shared with RCC. Our work identifies potential molecular targets for RCC susceptibility for downstream functional investigation."
39137404,YAP1 Inhibition Induces Phenotype Switching of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Tumor Suppressive in Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer rarely responds to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are critical components of the immunologically ""cold"" tumor microenvironment and are considered a promising target to enhance the immunotherapy response. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms regulating CAF plasticity to identify potential strategies to switch CAFs from protumorigenic to antitumor phenotypes and to enhance ICB efficacy in prostate cancer. Integration of four prostate cancer single-cell RNA sequencing datasets defined protumorigenic and antitumor CAFs, and RNA-seq, flow cytometry, and a prostate cancer organoid model demonstrated the functions of two CAF subtypes. Extracellular matrix-associated CAFs (ECM-CAF) promoted collagen deposition and cancer cell progression, and lymphocyte-associated CAFs (Lym-CAF) exhibited an antitumor phenotype and induced the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells. YAP1 activity regulated the ECM-CAF phenotype, and YAP1 silencing promoted switching to Lym-CAFs. NF-kappaB p65 was the core transcription factor in the Lym-CAF subset, and YAP1 inhibited nuclear translocation of p65. Selective depletion of YAP1 in ECM-CAFs in vivo promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation and enhanced the therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 treatment on prostate cancer. Overall, this study revealed a mechanism regulating CAF identity in prostate cancer and highlighted a therapeutic strategy for altering the CAF subtype to suppress tumor growth and increase sensitivity to ICB. Significance: YAP1 regulates cancer-associated fibroblast phenotypes and can be targeted to switch cancer-associated fibroblasts from a protumorigenic subtype that promotes extracellular matrix deposition to a tumor-suppressive subtype that stimulates antitumor immunity and immunotherapy efficacy."
39135633,Expression Analysis of VPS72 and Associated Biological Behaviors in Colon Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: VPS72 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer, participating in various cellular processes such as gene transcription, replication, DNA repair, maintenance of genome integrity, and cancer progression. However, its role in colorectal cancer remains unknown. METHODS: Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze gene expression, correlation and patient survival. Western blotting, colony formation assays and animal experiments were used to evaluate the function of VPS72 in colon cancer in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: VPS72 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and correlated with poor overall survival (P<0.05) and relapse free survival (P<0.01). Furthermore, patients with III/IV clinical stage (P<0.001), N1 nodal metastasis (P<0.001) or N2 nodal metastasis (P<0.05) status had poor overall survival. Further analysis showed that VPS72 is correlated with proliferation and EMT biomarkers. Western blotting, colony formation assays and animal experiments showed that VPS72 overexpression promoted colon cancer proliferation and EMT progress. CONCLUSION: Our study found that VPS72 was correlated with poor overall survival in colon cancer patients, and high expressed level of VPS72 promoted colon cancer progression, indicating its role as a potential prognosis biomarker."
39135136,Genomic profiles and clinical presentation of chordoma.,"Chordoma is a rare bone cancer with variable clinical outcomes. Here, we recruited 184 sporadic chordoma patients from the US and Canada and collected their clinical and treatment data. The average age at diagnosis was 45.5 years (Range 5-78) and the chordoma site distribution was 49.2% clivus, 26.2% spinal, and 24.0% sacral. Most patients (97.5%) received surgery as the primary treatment, among whom 85.3% also received additional treatment. Except for the most prevalent cancers like prostate, lung, breast, and skin cancer, there was no discernible enrichment for any specific cancer type among patients or their family members. Among a subset of patients (N = 70) with tumor materials, we conducted omics analyses and obtained targeted panel sequencing and SNP array genotyping data for 51 and 49 patients, respectively. The most recurrent somatic driver mutations included PIK3CA (12%), followed by chromatin remodeling genes PBRM1 and SETD2. Amplification of the 6q27 region, containing the chordoma susceptibility gene TBXT, was detected in eight patients (16.3%). Clival patients appeared to be less likely to carry driver gene mutations, chromosome arm level deletion events (e.g., 5p, 5p, and 9p), or 6q27 amplification compared to sacral patients. After adjusting for age, sex, tumor site, and additional treatment, patients with somatic deletions of 14q (OR = 13.73, 95% CI 1.96-96.02, P = 0.008) and 18p (OR = 13.68, 95% CI 1.77-105.89, P = 0.012) were more likely to have persistent chordoma. The study highlights genomic heterogeneity in chordoma, potentially linked to location and clinical progression."
39134575,Cluster effect for SNP-SNP interaction pairs for predicting complex traits.,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions are the key to improving polygenic risk scores. Previous studies reported several significant SNP-SNP interaction pairs that shared a common SNP to form a cluster, but some identified pairs might be false positives. This study aims to identify factors associated with the cluster effect of false positivity and develop strategies to enhance the accuracy of SNP-SNP interactions. The results showed the cluster effect is a major cause of false-positive findings of SNP-SNP interactions. This cluster effect is due to high correlations between a causal pair and null pairs in a cluster. The clusters with a hub SNP with a significant main effect and a large minor allele frequency (MAF) tended to have a higher false-positive rate. In addition, peripheral null SNPs in a cluster with a small MAF tended to enhance false positivity. We also demonstrated that using the modified significance criterion based on the 3 p-value rules and the bootstrap approach (3pRule + bootstrap) can reduce false positivity and maintain high true positivity. In addition, our results also showed that a pair without a significant main effect tends to have weak or no interaction. This study identified the cluster effect and suggested using the 3pRule + bootstrap approach to enhance SNP-SNP interaction detection accuracy."
39131609,Ferroptosis-related gene transferrin receptor protein 1 expression correlates with the prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic iron-dependent form of cell death implicated in various cancer pathologies. However, its precise role in tumor growth and progression of cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. Transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC), a key molecule associated with ferroptosis, has been identified as influencing a broad range of pathological processes in different cancers. However, the prognostic significance of TFRC in CC remains unclear. The present study utilized bioinformatics to explore the significance of the ferroptosis-related gene TFRC in the progression and prognosis of CC. METHODS: We obtained RNA sequencing data and corresponding clinical information on patients with CC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, we then generated a multigene signature of five ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) for the prognostic prediction of CC. We investigated the relationship between TFRC gene expression and immune cell infiltration by employing single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) analysis. The potential functional role of the TFRC gene was evaluated through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immunohistochemistry and qPCR was employed to assess TFRC mRNA and protein expression in 33 cases of cervical cancer. Furthermore, the relationship between TFRC mRNA expression and overall survival (OS) was investigated in patients. RESULTS: CC samples had significantly higher TFRC gene expression levels than normal tissue samples. Higher TFRC gene expression levels were strongly associated with higher cancer T stages and OS events. The findings of multivariate analyses illustrated that the OS in CC patients with high TFRC expression is shorter than in patients with low TFRC expression. Significant increases were observed in the levels of TFRC mRNA and protein expression in patients diagnosed with CC. CONCLUSION: Increased TFRC expression in CC was associated with disease progression, an unfavorable prognosis, and dysregulated immune cell infiltration. In addition, it highlights ferroptosis as a promising therapeutic target for CC."
39128337,Increased TP53 somatic evolution in peritoneal washes of individuals with BRCA1 germline mutations.,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants (BRCA carriers) are at high risk of developing high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). HGSC is predominantly driven by TP53 mutations, but mutations in this gene are also commonly found in non-cancerous tissue as a feature of normal human aging. We hypothesized that HGSC predisposition in BRCA carriers may be related to increased TP53 somatic evolution, which could be detectable by ultra-deep sequencing of TP53 mutations in gynecological liquid biopsies. METHODS: Duplex sequencing was used to identify TP53 mutations with high sensitivity in peritoneal washes and cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) collected at surgery from 60 individuals including BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, and non-carriers. TP53 mutation pathogenicity was compared across groups and with TP53 cancer mutations. RESULTS: TP53 mutations were more abundant in cervical LBC than in peritoneal washes but increased with age in both sample types. In peritoneal washes, but not in cervical LBC, pathogenic TP53 mutation burden was increased in BRCA1 carriers compared to non-carriers, independently of age. Five individuals shared identical pathogenic TP53 mutations in peritoneal washes and cervical LBC, but not in blood. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-deep sequencing of TP53 mutations in peritoneal washes collected at surgery reveals increased burden of pathogenic TP53 mutations in BRCA1 carriers. This excess of pathogenic TP53 mutations might be linked to the elevated risk of HGSC in these individuals. In some patients, concordant TP53 mutations were found in peritoneal washes and cervical LBCs, but the cell of origin remains unknown and deserves further investigation."
39127402,The glycolysis-related AMPK/ULK signaling pathway mediates the inhibitory effect of adiponectin in prostate cancer cells.,"OBJECTIVE: Reduced adiponectin (ADPN) levels have been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). The role of glycolysis in cancer development and treatment has attracted increasing attention. The present study aimed to elucidate its impact on PCa and to explore the mechanistic involvement of glycolysis. METHODS: An RM-1 cell xenograft model of Adpn-knockout mice was used to corroborate the effects of glycolysis, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, and autophagy on tumor xenograft progression. The effect of ADPN on PCa cells was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), lactate levels, and flow cytometry. The expression of glycolysis-related genes was detected using real-time RT-PCR in LNCaP and PC-3 cells after incubation with ADPN. Autophagic flux after ADPN treatment was quantified by chloroquine intervention and confocal analysis of mRFP-GFP-LC3. Alterations in the levels of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1), AMPK, Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7), p62, and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) were assessed after incubation of LNCaP cells with ADPN. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of xenograft tumors demonstrated significant upregulation of glycolysis in Adpn(-/-) mice. Lower levels of ADPN accelerated tumor xenograft growth, diminished p-AMPKalpha/AMPKalpha ratio and LC3B II/I ratio, and elevated levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) within the tumor microenvironment. ADPN inhibited proliferation and glycolysis and potentiated apoptosis in both cell lines. Expression of glycolysis-related genes decreased after ADPN treatment. Autophagic flux was elevated, as evidenced by changes in autophagy-related proteins and confocal microscopy analysis of mRFP-GFP-LC3. It led to the suppression of p62 while inducing phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and upregulating AdipoR1, ULK1, ATG7, and LC3B II/I ratio. CONCLUSION: ADPN inhibited the proliferation and progression of PCa cell-derived tumor xenografts by inhibiting glycolysis. Specifically, ADPN effectively inhibits glycolysis and activates the downstream AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway to suppress proliferation of PCa cells."
39127354,DICER1-sarcomas of GYN tract: Expanding on an emerging entity.,"Tumors with pathogenic DICER1 mutation are rare and encompass sporadic or hereditary benign, intermediate and malignant tumors. DICER1-associated sarcomas are heterogeneous; however, the prototypical ones in the GYN-tract include embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma and moderately to poorly differentiated Sertoli-Leydig tumor. In this report, we present three unique uterine sarcomas with DICER1 mutation and remarkable diffuse round/spindle cell morphology. The tumors occurred in cervix (n = 1), and uterine corpus (n = 2). The patient ages were 30, 37 and 59 years with tumor size of 8.8, 10 and 8.6 cm, respectively. Morphologically all three tumors were characterized by distinct spindle/round cell morphology and various amounts of neuroectodermal differentiation (yolk sac-like tubules, blastomatous areas and rosette formation). Other morphologic features of DICER1-sarcoma reported in the literature including cambium layer, focal or diffuse anaplasia, solid and cystic architecture, and chondroid/osteoid areas were absent. All three sarcomas were positive for SALL4 and had variable neuroendocrine marker expression. Whole genome methylation analysis was performed on one of the uterine sarcomas, which clustered the tumor with embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes. Follow up information was available on all three cases. Two patients were alive with no evidence of disease 13 and 14 months post operation, while one patient had imaging evidence of local recurrence 4 months post operation. In summary, we describe three unique DICER1-sarcomas and expand the phenotypic spectrum of this emerging entity, particularly with GYN-tract origin."
39127340,The E3 ligase TRIM22 functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer by targeting CCS for proteasomal degradation to inhibit STAT3 signaling.,"Deregulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases drives the proliferation and metastasis of various cancers; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22), a poorly investigated E3 ubiquitin ligase in the TRIM family, as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. High expression of TRIM22 in breast cancer correlated with better prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrated that TRIM22 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Label-free proteomics and biochemical analyses revealed that the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), an oncoprotein that is upregulated in breast cancer and promotes the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells, was a target of TRIM22 for degradation via K27-linked ubiquitination. Notably, the ability of the coiled-coil domain-defective mutants of TRIM22 to induce CCS ubiquitination and degradation diminished, with lysine 76 of the CCS serving as the ubiquitination site. Moreover, the TRIM22-mediated inhibition of the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells was restored by ectopic CCS expression. RNA-sequencing experiments using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that TRIM22 is involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. TRIM22 overexpression also improved reactive oxygen species levels in breast cancer cells and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation, which was restored via CCS overexpression or N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that TRIM22 overexpression decreased the enrichment of phosphorylated STAT3 in FN1, VIM and JARID2 promoters. Clinically, low TRIM22 expression correlated with high CCS expression and decreased survival rates in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, TRIM22 upregulation was associated with a better prognosis in patients with breast cancer who received classical therapy. TRIM22 expression was downregulated in many cancer types, including colon, kidney, lung, and prostate cancers. To the best of our knowledge, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM22 was first reported as a tumor suppressor that inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells through CCS ubiquitination and degradation. TRIM22 is a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with breast cancer."
39125671,"Elevated LAMTOR4 Expression Is Associated with Lethal Prostate Cancer and Its Knockdown Decreases Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and Migration In Vitro.","Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor, MAPK and mTOR, or LAMTOR, is a scaffold protein complex that senses nutrients and integrates growth factor signaling. The role of LAMTOR4 in tumorigenesis is still unknown. However, there is a considerable possibility that LAMTOR4 is directly involved in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the current study, we investigated the protein expression of LAMTOR4 in a cohort of 314 men who were undergoing transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) consisting of incidental, advanced and castration-resistant cases. We also correlated the data with ERG and PTEN genomic status and clinicopathological features including Gleason score and patients' outcome. Additionally, we performed in vitro experiments utilizing knockdown of LAMTOR4 in prostate cell lines, and we performed mRNA expression assessment using TCGA prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) to explore the potential differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with LAMTOR4 overexpression in PCa patients. Our data indicate that high LAMTOR4 protein expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.44, CI: 1.01-2.05, p = 0.047) and unfavorable cause-specific survival (CSS) (HR: 1.71, CI: 1.06-2.77, p = 0.028). Additionally, when high LAMTOR4 expression was combined with PTEN-negative cases (score 0), we found significantly poorer OS (HR: 2.22, CI: 1.37-3.59, p = 0.001) and CSS (HR: 3.46, CI: 1.86-6.46, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, ERG-positive cases with high LAMTOR4 exhibited lower OS (HR: 1.98, CI: 1.18-3.31, p = 0.01) and CSS (HR: 2.54, CI: 1.32-4.87, p = 0.005). In vitro assessment showed that knockdown of LAMTOR4 decreases PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our data further showed that knockdown of LAMTOR4 in the LNCaP cell line significantly dysregulated the beta catenin/mTOR pathway and tumorigenesis associated pathways. Inhibiting components of the mTOR pathway, including LAMTOR4, might offer a strategy to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer."
39125581,A Scaled Proteomic Discovery Study for Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Markers Using Proteograph(TM) and Trapped Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.,"There is a significant unmet need for clinical reflex tests that increase the specificity of prostate-specific antigen blood testing, the longstanding but imperfect tool for prostate cancer diagnosis. Towards this endpoint, we present the results from a discovery study that identifies new prostate-specific antigen reflex markers in a large-scale patient serum cohort using differentiating technologies for deep proteomic interrogation. We detect known prostate cancer blood markers as well as novel candidates. Through bioinformatic pathway enrichment and network analysis, we reveal associations of differentially abundant proteins with cytoskeletal, metabolic, and ribosomal activities, all of which have been previously associated with prostate cancer progression. Additionally, optimized machine learning classifier analysis reveals proteomic signatures capable of detecting the disease prior to biopsy, performing on par with an accepted clinical risk calculator benchmark."
39123346,Cobalt Serum Level as a Biomarker of Cause-Specific Survival among Prostate Cancer Patients.,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of death in male cancer patients. The WHO suggests that cobalt is involved in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer. There are, however, no studies associating cobalt levels and prostate cancer patient survival. In this study, 261 Polish prostate cancer (n = 261) patients were recruited into a prospective cohort between 2009 and 2015. Serum cobalt levels were measured using ICP-MS after prostate cancer diagnosis and before treatment. All study participants were assigned into quartiles (QI-QIV) based on the distribution of serum cobalt levels among censored patients. Univariable and multivariable COX regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for each serum cobalt level quartile. We found a significant relationship between high serum cobalt levels and poor prostate cancer patient total survival (HR = 2.60; 95% CI: 1.17-5.82; p = 0.02). In relation to prostate cancer patients who died as a result of other non-cancer causes, the association with high levels of cobalt was even stronger (HR = 3.67; 95% CI: 1.03-13.00; p = 0.04). The impact of high serum cobalt levels on overall survival of prostate cancer-specific-related deaths was not statistically significant."
39122088,The closed loop of the circCLIP2/miR-361-3p/STAT2 signaling axis regulates the progression of cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and the progression of cancer through various pathways. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in cervical cancer are not fully understood. The present study was designed to explore the biological functions and potential mechanisms of circCLIP2 (has_circ_0001717) in cervical cancer. METHODS: The expression profiles of circRNAs in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues of cervical cancer patients were examined using RNA sequencing. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were carried out to determine the biological functions of circCLIP2 in the proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. qRT-PCR was also used to evaluate the expression of circCLIP2, miR-361-3p and STAT2 in cervical cancer cells. The protein levels of STAT2 were determined by western blotting. RESULTS: CircCLIP2 was identified as the most down-regulated molecule in the cancerous tissues of cervical cancer patients compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, the levels of circCLIP2 was decreased in cervical cancer patients with metastasis and advanced tumour stage, and patients with high-circCLIP2-expression exhibited poorer survival rate. In addition, over-expression of circCLIP2 suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cervical cancer cells, whereas cell apoptosis was enhanced. Moreover, down-regulated circCLIP2 functioned as the sponge of miR-361-3p, which reduced the expression of STAT2. Furthermore, knockdown of STAT2 inhibited the expression of circCLIP2 at the transcriptional level. CONCLUSION: The circCLIP2/miR-361-3p/STAT2 signalling could mediate the progression of cervical cancer. CircCLIP2 may become a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer."
39121689,Androgen receptor deficiency-induced TUG1 in suppressing ferroptosis to promote benign prostatic hyperplasia through the miR-188-3p/GPX4 signal pathway.,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), characterized by the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate, exhibits a pronounced association with inflammation resulting from androgen receptor (AR) deficiency. Ferroptosis, a cell death mechanism triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and closely linked to inflammation, has yet to be fully understood in the context of BPH. Using RNA sequencing, we observed a significant elevation of taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in BPH tissues compared to normal prostate tissue. High levels of TUG1 exhibited a discernible correlation with both prostate volume and the extent of inflammatory infiltration in BPH patients. The suppression of TUG1 not only led to a reduction in prostate size but also ameliorated AR-deficiency-induced prostatic hyperplasia. Mechanistically, a decrease in AR in prostate luminal cells prompted macrophage aggregation and the release of IL-1beta, subsequently fostering the transcription of TUG1 via MYC. Induced TUG1, through competitive binding with miR-188-3p, facilitated the expression of GPX4, thereby diminishing intracellular ROS levels and impeding ferroptosis in prostate luminal cells. Notably, the ferroptosis inducer JKE-1674 alleviated inflammation-induced prostatic hyperplasia in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that AR deficiency crucially inhibits ferroptosis, promoting BPH via the TUG1/miR-188-3p/GPX4 signaling axis, and making ferroptosis induction a promising therapeutic strategy for BPH patients with AR deficiency."
39121438,Molecular and Clinicopathologic Impact of GNAS Variants Across Solid Tumors.,"PURPOSE: The molecular drivers underlying mucinous tumor pathogenicity are poorly understood. GNAS mutations predict metastatic burden and treatment resistance in mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma. We investigated the pan-cancer clinicopathologic relevance of GNAS variants. METHODS: We assessed 58,043 patients with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (IMPACT)-sequenced solid tumors to identify oncogenic variants, including GNAS, associated with mucinous tumor phenotype. We then performed comprehensive molecular analyses to compare GNAS-mutant (mut) and wild-type tumors across cancers. Gene expression patterns associated with GNAS-mut tumors were assessed in a The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. Associations between GNAS variant status and peritoneal metastasis, first-line systemic therapy response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using a propensity-matched subcohort of patients with metastatic disease. RESULTS: Mucinous tumors were enriched for oncogenic GNAS variants. GNAS was mutated in >1% of small bowel, cervical, colorectal, pancreatic, esophagogastric, hepatobiliary, and GI neuroendocrine cancers. Across these cancers, GNAS-mut tumors exhibited a generally conserved C-to-T mutation-high, aneuploidy-low molecular profile with co-occurring prevalent KRAS variants (65% of GNAS-mut tumors) and fewer TP53 alterations. GNAS-mut tumors exhibited recurrently comutated alternative tumor suppressors (RBM10, INPPL1) and upregulation of MAPK and cell surface modulators. GNAS-mut tumors demonstrate an increased prevalence of peritoneal metastases (odds ratio [OR], 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5]; P = .006), worse response to first-line systemic therapy (OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3 to 3.8]; P = .003), and shorter PFS (median, 5.6 v 7.0 months; P = .047). In a multivariable analysis, GNAS mutated status was independently prognostic of worse OS (hazard ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.56]; adjusted P = .04). CONCLUSION: Across the assessed cancers, GNAS-mut tumors exhibit a conserved molecular and clinical phenotype defined by mucinous tumor status, increased peritoneal metastasis, poor response to first-line systemic therapy, and worse survival."
39119731,Association between racial residential segregation and screening uptake for colorectal and cervical cancer among Black and White patients in five US health care systems.,"BACKGROUND: Despite increased recognition that structural racism contributes to poorer health outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities, there are knowledge gaps about how current patterns of racial residential segregation are associated with cancer screening uptake. The authors examined associations between Black residential segregation and screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cervical cancer among non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White adults. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of CRC and cervical cancer screening-eligible adults from five health care systems within the Population-Based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR II) Consortium (cohort entry, 2010-2012). Residential segregation was measured using site-specific quartiles of the Black local isolation score (LIS). The outcome was receipt of CRC or cervical cancer screening within 3 years of cohort entry (2010-2015). Logistic regression was used to calculate associations between the LIS and screening completion, adjusting for patient-level covariates. RESULTS: Among CRC (n = 642,661) and cervical cancer (n = 163,340) screening-eligible patients, 456,526 (71.0%) and 106,124 (65.0%), respectively, received screening. Across PROSPR sites, living in neighborhoods with higher LIS tended to be associated with lower odds of CRC screening (Kaiser Permanente Northern California: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] LIS trend in Black patients, 0.95 [p < .001]; aOR LIS trend in White patients, 0.98 [p < .001]; Kaiser Permanente Southern California: aOR LIS trend in Black patients, 0.98 [p = .026]; aOR LIS trend in White patients, 1.01 [p = .023]; Kaiser Permanente Washington: aOR LIS trend in White patients, 0.97 [p = .002]. However, for cervical cancer screening, associations with the LIS varied by site and race (Kaiser Permanente Washington: aOR LIS trend in White patients, 0.95 [p < .001]; Mass General Brigham: aOR LIS trend in Black patients, 1.12 [p < .001]; aOR LIS trend in White patients, 1.03 [p < .001]). CONCLUSIONS: Across five diverse health care systems, the direction of the association between Black residential segregation and screening varied by PROSPR site, race, and screening type. Additional research, including studies that examine multiple dimensions of segregation and structural racism using intersectional approaches, are needed to further disentangle these relationships."
39118157,Identification of RBM15 as a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer involving the regulation of prognostic m6A-related lncRNAs.,"BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNA play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, knowledge regarding the expression patterns of m6A-related lncRNAs and their corresponding m6A regulators in prostate cancer (PCa) is limited. This study aimed to delineate the landscape of m6A-related lncRNAs, develop a predictive model, and identify the critical m6A regulators of prognostic lncRNAs in PCa. METHODS: Clinical and transcriptome data of PCa patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Prognostic m6A-related lncRNAs were subsequently identified through Pearson correlation and univariate Cox regression analyses. The prognostic lncRNAs were clustered into two groups by consensus clustering analysis, and a risk signature model was constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis of the lncRNAs. This model was evaluated using survival, clinicopathological, and immunological analyses. Furthermore, based on the constructed lncRNA-m6A regulatory network and RT-qPCR results, RBM15 was identified as a critical regulator of m6A-related lncRNAs. The biological roles of RBM15 in PCa were explored through bioinformatics analysis and biological experiments. RESULTS: Thirty-four prognostic m6A-related lncRNAs were identified and categorized into two clusters with different expression patterns and survival outcomes in PCa patients. Seven m6A lncRNAs (AC105345.1, AL354989.1, AC138028.4, AC022211.1, AC020558.2, AC004076.2, and LINC02666) were selected to construct a risk signature with robust predictive ability for overall survival and were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and the immune microenvironment of PCa patients. Among them, LINC02666 and AC022211.1 were regulated by RBM15. In addition, RBM15 expression correlated with PCa progression, survival, and the immune response. Patients with elevated RBM15 expression were more susceptible to the drug AMG-232. Moreover, silencing RBM15 decreased the viability of PCa cells and promoted apoptosis. CONCLUSION: RBM15 is involved in the regulation of prognostic lncRNAs in the risk signature and has a robust predictive ability for PCa, making it a promising biomarker in PCa."
39118140,DNA methylation correlates of chronological age in diverse human tissue types.,"BACKGROUND: While the association of chronological age with DNA methylation (DNAm) in whole blood has been extensively studied, the tissue-specificity of age-related DNAm changes remains an active area of research. Studies investigating the association of age with DNAm in tissues such as brain, skin, immune cells, fat, and liver have identified tissue-specific and non-specific effects, thus, motivating additional studies of diverse human tissue and cell types. RESULTS: Here, we performed an epigenome-wide association study, leveraging DNAm data (Illumina EPIC array) from 961 tissue samples representing 9 tissue types (breast, lung, colon, ovary, prostate, skeletal muscle, testis, whole blood, and kidney) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identified age-associated CpG sites (false discovery rate < 0.05) in 8 tissues (all except skeletal muscle, n = 47). This included 162,002 unique hypermethylated and 90,626 hypomethylated CpG sites across all tissue types, with 130,137 (80%) hypermethylated CpGs and 74,703 (82%) hypomethylated CpG sites observed in a single tissue type. While the majority of age-associated CpG sites appeared tissue-specific, the patterns of enrichment among genomic features, such as chromatin states and CpG islands, were similar across most tissues, suggesting common mechanisms underlying cellular aging. Consistent with previous findings, we observed that hypermethylated CpG sites are enriched in regions with repressed polycomb signatures and CpG islands, while hypomethylated CpG sites preferentially occurred in non-CpG islands and enhancers. To gain insights into the functional effects of age-related DNAm changes, we assessed the correlation between DNAm and local gene expression changes to identify age-related expression quantitative trait methylation (age-eQTMs). We identified several age-eQTMs present in multiple tissue-types, including in the CDKN2A, HENMT1, and VCWE regions. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings will aid future efforts to develop biomarkers of aging and understand mechanisms of aging in diverse human tissue types."
39117800,CDK9 inhibition inhibits multiple oncogenic transcriptional and epigenetic pathways in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) stimulates oncogenic transcriptional pathways in cancer and CDK9 inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic candidates. METHODS: The activity of an orally bioavailable CDK9 inhibitor, CDKI-73, was evaluated in prostate cancer cell lines, a xenograft mouse model, and patient-derived tumor explants and organoids. Expression of CDK9 was evaluated in clinical specimens by mining public datasets and immunohistochemistry. Effects of CDKI-73 on prostate cancer cells were determined by cell-based assays, molecular profiling and transcriptomic/epigenomic approaches. RESULTS: CDKI-73 inhibited proliferation and enhanced cell death in diverse in vitro and in vivo models of androgen receptor (AR)-driven and AR-independent models. Mechanistically, CDKI-73-mediated inhibition of RNA polymerase II serine 2 phosphorylation resulted in reduced expression of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic factors and transcriptional defects. Transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches revealed that CDKI-73 suppressed signaling pathways regulated by AR, MYC, and BRD4, key drivers of dysregulated transcription in prostate cancer, and reprogrammed cancer-associated super-enhancers. These latter findings prompted the evaluation of CDKI-73 with the BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153, a combination that was synergistic in patient-derived organoids and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that CDK9 inhibition disrupts multiple oncogenic pathways and positions CDKI-73 as a promising therapeutic agent for prostate cancer, particularly aggressive, therapy-resistant subtypes."
39115711,Altered expression and localization of nuclear envelope proteins in a prostate cancer cell system.,"BACKGROUND: The nuclear envelope (NE), which is composed of the outer and inner nuclear membranes, the nuclear pore complex and the nuclear lamina, regulates a plethora of cellular processes, including those that restrict cancer development (genomic stability, cell cycle regulation, and cell migration). Thus, impaired NE is functionally related to tumorigenesis, and monitoring of NE alterations is used to diagnose cancer. However, the chronology of NE changes occurring during cancer evolution and the connection between them remained to be precisely defined, due to the lack of appropriate cell models. METHODS: The expression and subcellular localization of NE proteins (lamins A/C and B1 and the inner nuclear membrane proteins emerin and beta-dystroglycan [beta-DG]) during prostate cancer progression were analyzed, using confocal microscopy and western blot assays, and a prostate cancer cell system comprising RWPE-1 epithelial prostate cells and several prostate cancer cell lines with different invasiveness. RESULTS: Deformed nuclei and the mislocalization and low expression of lamin A/C, lamin B1, and emerin became more prominent as the invasiveness of the prostate cancer lines increased. Suppression of lamin A/C expression was an early event during prostate cancer evolution, while a more extensive deregulation of NE proteins, including beta-DG, occurred in metastatic prostate cells. CONCLUSIONS: The RWPE-1 cell line-based system was found to be suitable for the correlation of NE impairment with prostate cancer invasiveness and determination of the chronology of NE alterations during prostate carcinogenesis. Further study of this cell system would help to identify biomarkers for prostate cancer prognosis and diagnosis."
39113632,Poor Prognosis among Radiation-Associated Bladder Cancer Is Defined by Clinicogenomic Features.,"Radiotherapy (RT) for prostate cancer has been associated with an increased risk for the development of bladder cancer. We aimed to integrate clinical and genomic data to better understand the development of RT-associated bladder cancer. A retrospective analysis was performed to identify control patients (CTRL; n = 41) and patients with RT-associated bladder cancer (n = 41). RT- and CTRL-specific features were then identified through integration and analysis of the genomic sequencing data and clinical variables. RT-associated bladder tumors were significantly enriched for alterations in KDM6A and ATM, whereas CTRL tumors were enriched for CDKN2A mutation. Globally, there were an increased number of variants within RT tumors, albeit at a lower variant allele frequency. Mutational signature analysis revealed three predominate motif patterns, with similarity to SBS2/13 (APOBEC3A), SBS5 (ERCC2/smoking), and SBS6/15 (MMR). Poor prognostic factors in the RT cohort include a short tumor latency, smoking status, the presence of the smoking and X-ray therapy mutational signatures, and CDKN2A copy number loss. Based on the clinical and genomic findings, we suggest at least two potential pathways leading to RT-associated bladder cancer: The first occurs in the setting of field cancerization related to smoking or preexisting genetic alterations and leads to the development of more aggressive bladder tumors, and the second involves RT initiating the oncogenic process in otherwise healthy urothelium, leading to a longer latency and less aggressive disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Clinicogenomic analysis of radiation-associated bladder cancer uncovered mutational signatures that, in addition to a short tumor latency, smoking, and CDKN2A loss, are associated with a poor outcome. These clinical and genomic features provide a potential method to identify patients with prostate cancer who are at an increased risk for the development of aggressive bladder cancer following prostate RT."
39113611,MYBL2 Drives Prostate Cancer Plasticity: Inhibiting Its Transcriptional Target CDK2 for RB1-Deficient Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.,"Phenotypic plasticity is a recognized mechanism driving therapeutic resistance in patients with prostate cancer. Although underlying molecular causations driving phenotypic plasticity have been identified, therapeutic success is yet to be achieved. To identify putative master regulator transcription factors (MR-TF) driving phenotypic plasticity in prostate cancer, this work utilized a multiomic approach using genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer combined with patient data to identify MYB proto-oncogene like 2 (MYBL2) as a significantly enriched transcription factor in prostate cancer exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. Genetic inhibition of Mybl2 using independent murine prostate cancer cell lines representing phenotypic plasticity demonstrated Mybl2 loss significantly decreased in vivo growth as well as cell fitness and repressed gene expression signatures involved in pluripotency and stemness. Because MYBL2 is currently not druggable, a MYBL2 gene signature was employed to identify cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) as a potential therapeutic target. CDK2 inhibition phenocopied genetic loss of Mybl2 and significantly decreased in vivo tumor growth associated with enrichment of DNA damage. Together, this work demonstrates MYBL2 as an important MR-TF driving phenotypic plasticity in prostate cancer. Furthermore, high MYBL2 activity identifies prostate cancer that would be responsive to CDK2 inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: Prostate cancers that escape therapy targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathways via phenotypic plasticity are currently untreatable. Our study identifies MYBL2 as a MR-TF in phenotypic plastic prostate cancer and implicates CDK2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for this most lethal subtype of prostate cancer."
39113562,"Discovery of a novel highly specific, fully human PSCA antibody and its application as an antibody-drug conjugate in prostate cancer.","Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is expressed in all stages of prostate cancer, including in advanced androgen-independent tumors and bone metastasis. PSCA may associate with prostate carcinogenesis and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer. PSCA is also a promising theranostic marker for a variety of other solid tumors, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we identified a novel fully human PSCA antibody using phage display methodology. The structure-based affinity maturation yielded a high-affinity binder, F12, which is highly specific and does not bind to 6,000 human membrane proteins based on a membrane proteome array assay. F12 targets PSCA amino acids 63-69 as tested by the peptide scanning microarray, and it cross-reacts with the murine PSCA. IgG1 F12 efficiently internalizes into PSCA-expressing tumor cells. The antimitotic reagent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-conjugated IgG1 F12 (ADC, F12-MMAE) exhibits dose-dependent efficacy and specificity in a human prostate cancer PC-3-PSCA xenograft NSG mouse model. This is a first reported ADC based on a fully human PSCA antibody and MMAE that is characterized in a xenograft murine model, which warrants further optimizations and investigations in additional preclinical tumor models, including prostate and other solid tumors."
39113410,Elevated expression of Golgi Transport 1B promotes the progression of cervical cancer by activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway via interaction with TANK-Binding Kinase 1.,"As a preventable disease, cervical cancer (cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma-CESC) remains a tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the pressing need for effective treatment strategies. This research identified Golgi transport 1B (GOLT1B) as a critical gene involved in the development of cervical cancer. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were investigated to determine the upregulation of GOLT1B in cervical cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. Besides, GOLT1B was found to predict poor prognosis in cervical cancer by utilizing Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). The functional assay indicated that GOLT1B promoted CESC viability and migration in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing results suggested that GOLT1B likely influenced the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway. The subsequent western blot and dual luciferase reporter assay revealed the interaction between GOLT1B and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), modulating the NF-kappaB pathway. More importantly, GOLT1B was also found to regulate immune cell infiltration, suggesting its potential role in the tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, GOLT1B promotes CESC progression via interaction with TBK1 and augmentation of NF-kappaB signaling-mediated cancer-associated inflammation, which provides us with a new approach to CESC target therapy."
39113388,HPV18 E6/E7 activates Ca(2+) influx to promote the malignant progression of cervical cancer by inhibiting Ca(2+) binding protein 1 expression.,"Mounting studies have shown that the oncoproteins E6 and E7 encoded by the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome are essential in HPV-induced cervical cancer (CC). Ca(2+) binding protein 1 (CABP1), a downstream target of HPV18-positive HeLa cells that interferes with E6/E7 expression, was identified through screening the GEO Database (GSE6926). It was confirmed to be down-regulated in CC through TCGA prediction and in vitro detection. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that knocking down E6/E7 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas knocking down CABP1 promoted these processes. Simultaneously knocking down CABP1 reversed these effects. Additionally, the results were validated in vivo. Previous studies have indicated that CABP1 can regulate Ca(2+) channels, influencing Ca(2+) influx and tumor progression. In this study, it was observed that knocking down CABP1 enhanced Ca(2+) inflow, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Knocking down E6/E7 inhibited these processes, whereas simultaneously knocking down E6/E7 and CABP1 restored the inhibitory effect of knocking down E6/E7 on Ca(2+) inflow. To further elucidate that E6/E7 promotes CC progression by inhibiting CABP1 expression and activating Ca(2+) influx, BAPTA/AM treatment was administered during CABP1 knockdown. It was discovered that Ca(2+) chelation could reverse the effect of CABP1 knockdown on CC cells. In conclusion, our results offer a novel target for the diagnosis and treatment of HPV-induced CC."
39113216,A cross-species analysis of fecal microbiomes in humans and mice reveals similarities and dissimilarities associated with prostate cancer risk.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a complex disease that develops over time and is influenced by several lifestyle factors that also impact gut microbes. Gut dysbiosis is intricately linked to prostate carcinogenesis, but the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. Mice are crucial for studying the relationships between gut microbes and prostate cancer, but discovering similarities between humans and mice may aid in elucidating new mechanisms. METHODS: We used 16s rRNA sequencing data from stool samples of tumor-bearing prostate-specific conditional Pten-knockout mice, disease-free wildtype mice, and a human cohort suspected of having prostate cancer to conduct taxonomic and metagenomic profiling. Features were associated with prostate cancer status and low risk (a negative biopsy of Gleason grade <2) or high risk (Gleason grade >/=2) in humans. RESULTS: In both humans and mice, community composition differed between individuals with and without prostate cancer. Odoribacter spp. and Desulfovibrio spp. were taxa associated with prostate cancer in mice and humans. Metabolic pathways associated with cofactor and vitamin synthesis were common in mouse and human prostate cancer, including bacterial synthesis of folate (vitamin B9), ubiquinone (CoQ10), phylloquinone (vitamin K1), menaquinone (vitamin K2), and tocopherol (vitamin E). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides valuable data that can help bridge the gap between human and mouse microbiomes. Our findings provide evidence to support the notion that certain bacterial-derived metabolites may promote prostate cancer, as well as a preclinical model that can be used to characterize biological mechanisms and develop preventive interventions."
39112416,Assessing the acceptability and appropriateness of a psychoeducational graphic novel about inherited cancer risk designed for men.,"Men with germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are at an increased lifetime risk for developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Men report that managing clinical care is challenging because they are under-informed about their cancer risks. As the demand for genetic testing has increased, so too has the need to relay accurate and relatable genetic health information. This research developed and assessed the acceptability and appropriateness of a psychoeducational graphic novel designed for men to improve their cancer risk knowledge, manage their cancer-related uncertainty, and increase their intent to disclose their BRCA1/2 risks to family members and healthcare providers. Through purposive and snowball sampling, men (n = 20) and certified genetic counselors (CGCs; n = 15) participated in semi-structured interviews assessing the acceptability and appropriateness of the graphic novel. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Both reported that the graphic novel confirmed risk information provided helpful resources, included relatable storylines, and had a unique visual appeal. Some men remained unsure about how to perform recommended screenings and how to talk to family members, particularly children, about BRCA1/2 test results after assessing the graphic novel. CGCs also discussed the helpfulness of the graphic novel for their practice. Given that this psychoeducational graphic novel was appealing to men and CGCs, it shows promise as an acceptable approach that may assist men in managing their cancer risks and communicating their genetic risk information to family members and healthcare providers."
39107274,Epigenome-wide impact of MAT2A sustains the androgen-indifferent state and confers synthetic vulnerability in ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a frequently occurring disease with adverse clinical outcomes and limited therapeutic options. Here, we identify methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) as a critical driver of the androgen-indifferent state in ERG fusion-positive CRPC. MAT2A is upregulated in CRPC and cooperates with ERG in promoting cell plasticity, stemness and tumorigenesis. RNA, ATAC and ChIP-sequencing coupled with histone post-translational modification analysis by mass spectrometry show that MAT2A broadly impacts the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape. MAT2A enhances H3K4me2 at multiple genomic sites, promoting the expression of pro-tumorigenic non-canonical AR target genes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MAT2A reverses the transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling in CRPC models and improves the response to AR and EZH2 inhibitors. These data reveal a role of MAT2A in epigenetic reprogramming and provide a proof of concept for testing MAT2A inhibitors in CRPC patients to improve clinical responses and prevent treatment resistance."
39107195,Targeting Androgen Receptor Alterations in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"There have been significant advances in our understanding of the biology of metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and its response to therapy. Androgen receptor (AR) alterations, including mutations, amplifications, splice variants, and alternative activations, play a significant role in mPCa resistance to treatment. Recent studies indicate that AR alterations detected via genomic testing can be considered predictive biomarkers in men with castration-resistant PCa and can guide treatment strategies. Novel therapeutic approaches, including AR antagonists and inhibitors of ACK1, the AR N-terminal domain, or cytochrome P450 11A1, have shown promise in overcoming treatment resistance. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the efficacy of these treatments in relation to AR mutation status and could potentially transform the treatment landscape for mPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our mini review highlights advances in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, with a focus on drugs that target genetic alterations affecting a protein called the androgen receptor. Some promising results have been obtained and clinical trials are ongoing."
39107132,Targeting tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 improves efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in combination with PD-1 blockade for cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. METHODS: In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell-cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. RESULTS: Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the dynamic cell-cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy."
39106160,Central role of SUMOylation in the regulation of chromatin interactions and transcriptional outputs of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is pivotal in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and represents a critical therapeutic target. AR-mediated gene regulation involves intricate interactions with nuclear proteins, with many mediating and undergoing post-translational modifications that present alternative therapeutic avenues. Through chromatin proteomics in PCa cells, we identified SUMO ligases together with nuclear receptor coregulators and pioneer transcription factors within the AR's protein network. Intriguingly, this network displayed a significant association with SUMO2/3. To elucidate the influence of SUMOylation on AR chromatin interactions and subsequent gene regulation, we inhibited SUMOylation using ML-792 (SUMOi). While androgens generally facilitated the co-occupancy of SUMO2/3 and AR on chromatin, SUMOi induced divergent effects dependent on the type of AR-binding site (ARB). SUMOi augmented AR's pioneer-like binding on inaccessible chromatin regions abundant in androgen response elements (AREs) and diminished its interaction with accessible chromatin regions sparse in AREs yet rich in pioneer transcription factor motifs. The SUMOi-impacted ARBs divergently influenced AR-regulated genes; those associated with AR-mediated activation played roles in negative regulation of cell proliferation, while those with AR-mediated repression were involved in pattern formation. In conclusion, our findings underscore the pervasive influence of SUMOylation in shaping AR's role in PCa cells, potentially unveiling new therapeutic strategies."
39105820,TIGIT expression in renal cell carcinoma infiltrating T cells is variable and inversely correlated with PD-1 and LAG3.,"PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but many patients do not respond to therapy and the majority develop resistant disease over time. Thus, there is increasing need for alternative immunomodulating agents. The co-inhibitory molecule T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) may play a role in resistance to approved immune checkpoint inhibitors and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. The purpose of this study was to quantify TIGIT positivity in tumor-infiltrating T cells in RCC. METHODS: We employed tissue microarrays containing specimens from primary RCC tumors, adjacent normal renal tissue, and RCC metastases to quantify TIGIT within tumor-infiltrating CD3(+) T cells using quantitative immunofluorescent analysis. We also compared these results to TIGIT(+) CD3(+) levels in four other tumor types (melanoma, non-small cell lung, cervical, and head and neck cancers). RESULTS: We did not observe significant differences in TIGIT positivity between primary RCC tumors and patient-matched metastatic samples. We found that the degree of TIGIT positivity in RCC is comparable to that in lung cancer but lower than that in melanoma, cervical, and head and neck cancers. Correlation analysis comparing TIGIT positivity to previously published, patient-matched spatial proteomic data by our group revealed a negative association between TIGIT and the checkpoint proteins PD-1 and LAG3. CONCLUSION: Our findings support careful evaluation of TIGIT expression on T cells in primary or metastatic RCC specimens for patients who may be treated with TIGIT-targeting antibodies, as increased TIGIT positivity might be associated with a greater likelihood of response to therapy."
39105261,"Expression of the alphaVbeta3 integrin affects prostate cancer sEV cargo and density and promotes sEV pro-tumorigenic activity in vivo through a GPI-anchored receptor, NgR2.","It is known that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are released from cancer cells and contribute to cancer progression via crosstalk with recipient cells. We have previously reported that sEVs expressing the alphaVbeta3 integrin, a protein upregulated in aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPrCa), contribute to neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in recipient cells. Here, we examine the impact of alphaVbeta3 expression on sEV protein content, density and function. sEVs used in this study were isolated by iodixanol density gradients and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting and single vesicle analysis. Our proteomic profile of sEVs containing alphaVbeta3 shows downregulation of typical effectors involved in apoptosis and necrosis and an upregulation of tumour cell survival factors compared to control sEVs. We also show that the expression of alphaVbeta3 in sEVs causes a distinct reposition of EV markers (Alix, CD81, CD9) to a low-density sEV subpopulation. This low-density reposition is independent of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein interactions with sEVs. This sEV subset contains alphaVbeta3 and an alphaVbeta3 downstream effector, NgR2, a novel marker for NEPrCa. We show that sEVs containing alphaVbeta3 are loaded with higher amounts of NgR2 as compared to sEVs that do not express alphaVbeta3. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sEVs containing NgR2 do not affect the sEV marker profile, but when injected in vivo intratumorally, they promote tumour growth and induce NED. We show that sEVs expressing NgR2 increase the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a known promoter of cancer cell proliferation, in recipient cells. We also show that NgR2 mimics the effect of sEVs containing alphaVbeta3 since it displays increased growth of NgR2 transfectants in vivo, as compared to control cells. Overall, our results describe the changes that occur in cargo, density and functions of cancer cell-derived sEVs containing the alphaVbeta3 integrin and its effector, NgR2, without affecting the sEV tetraspanin profiles."
39103353,Proteostasis perturbation of N-Myc leveraging HSP70 mediated protein turnover improves treatment of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.,"N-Myc is a key driver of neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). One potential way to circumvent the challenge of undruggable N-Myc is to target the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) system that maintains N-Myc levels. Here, we identify heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) as a top partner of N-Myc, which binds a conserved ""SELILKR"" motif and prevents the access of E3 ubiquitin ligase, STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 (STUB1), possibly through steric hindrance. When HSP70's dwell time on N-Myc is increased by treatment with the HSP70 allosteric inhibitor, STUB1 is in close proximity with N-Myc and becomes functional to promote N-Myc ubiquitination on the K416 and K419 sites and forms polyubiquitination chains linked by the K11 and K63 sites. Notably, HSP70 inhibition significantly suppressed NEPC tumor growth, increased the efficacy of aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitors, and limited the expression of neuroendocrine-related pathways."
39102888,Reporting tumor genomic test results to SEER registries via linkages.,"BACKGROUND: Precision medicine has become a mainstay of cancer care in recent years. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program has been an authoritative source of cancer statistics and data since 1973. However, tumor genomic information has not been adequately captured in the cancer surveillance data, which impedes population-based research on molecular subtypes. To address this, the SEER Program has developed and implemented a centralized process to link SEER registries' tumor cases with genomic test results that are provided by molecular laboratories to the registries. METHODS: Data linkages were carried out following operating procedures for centralized linkages established by the SEER Program. The linkages used Match*Pro, a probabilistic linkage software, and were facilitated by the registries' trusted third party (an honest broker). The SEER registries provide to NCI limited datasets that undergo preliminary evaluation prior to their release to the research community. RESULTS: Recently conducted genomic linkages included OncotypeDX Breast Recurrence Score, OncotypeDX Breast Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, OncotypeDX Genomic Prostate Score, Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier, DecisionDX Uveal Melanoma, DecisionDX Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma, DecisionDX Melanoma, and germline tests results in Georgia and California SEER registries. CONCLUSIONS: The linkages of cancer cases from SEER registries with genomic test results obtained from molecular laboratories offer an effective approach for data collection in cancer surveillance. By providing de-identified data to the research community, the NCI's SEER Program enables scientists to investigate numerous research inquiries."
39102549,Prostate cancer-induced endothelial-cell-to-osteoblast transition drives immunosuppression in the bone-tumor microenvironment through Wnt pathway-induced M2 macrophage polarization.,"Immune checkpoint therapy has limited efficacy for patients with bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (bmCRPC). To improve immunotherapy for bmCRPC, we aimed to identify the mechanism of bmCRPC-induced changes in the immune microenvironment. Among bmCRPC patients, higher levels of a 32-gene M2-like macrophage signature in bone metastasis samples correlated with shorter overall survival. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD206-positive (CD206(+)) macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC bone biopsy specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastases. In preclinical osteogenic prostate cancer (Pca) xenograft models, CD206(+) macrophages were recruited to areas with tumor-induced bone. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis showed higher expression of an M2-like gene signature, with activated canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways, in tumor-associated macrophages isolated from osteogenic tumors (bone-TAMs) than in TAMs isolated from nonosteogenic tumors (ctrl-TAMs). Mechanistic studies showed that endothelial cells (ECs) that had undergone EC-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition, the precursors of tumor-induced OSBs, produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14, and lysyl oxidase, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to the bone-tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Bone-TAMs suppressed CD8(+) T cells' proliferation and cytolytic activity, and these effects were partially reversed by treating bone-TAMs with Wnt inhibitors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pca-induced EC-to-OSB transition reduced the levels of M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. Our study demonstrates that Pca-induced EC-to-OSB transition drives immunosuppression in the bone-TME, suggesting that therapies that reduce Pca-induced bone formation may improve immunotherapeutic outcomes for bmCRPC."
39102448,COPS: A novel platform for multi-omic disease subtype discovery via robust multi-objective evaluation of clustering algorithms.,"Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies."
39101634,Detection of JC and BK polyomaviruses in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by PCR.,"BACKGROUND: Overall, 20-30% of all cancers are estimated to be linked to infectious agents. Polyomaviruses are oncogenic cause in rodent models, readily transform their cells, and cause chromosomal instability in animal and human cells in-vitro. Some reports have indicated the presence of JCPyV and BKPyV in some human tumors. The JCPyV and BKPyV genome encodes some transforming proteins such as LT-Ag. Thus, these viruses could cause or promote some neoplasia, such as lymphomas, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. Risk factors for developing CRC are associated with personal features or habits, such as age, lifestyle, and gut microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined the prevalence of JCPyV and BKPyV in the 23 fecal samples of CRC patients and 24 healthy samples (control group). Virus DNA was extracted by a Favorgen DNA extraction kit. The large T antigen of JCPyV and VP1 of BKPyV were investigated by optimized multiplex PCR. RESULTS: One of the samples was positive for the JCPyV (4.3%), while in the samples of healthy individuals, the JCPyV was negative. Also, positive results for BKPyV PCR were obtained for five cases (21.7%) in the samples of the CRC group and one case (4.1%) in healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: The result showed no direct correlation between tumorigenesis and polyomavirus infections in CRC development. However, the exact role of BKPyV and JCPyV is still controversial and needs further study with larger sample size."
39101335,Validation and functional follow-up of cervical cancer risk variants at the HLA locus.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in females. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have proposed cervical cancer susceptibility variants at the HLA locus on chromosome 6p21. To corroborate these findings and investigate their functional impact in cervical tissues and cell lines, we genotyped nine variants from cervical cancer GWASs (rs17190106, rs535777, rs1056429, rs2763979, rs143954678, rs113937848, rs3117027, rs3130214, and rs9477610) in a German hospital-based series of 1122 invasive cervical cancers, 1408 dysplasias, and 1196 healthy controls. rs17190106, rs1056429 and rs143954678/rs113937848 associated with cervical malignancies overall, while rs17190106 and rs535777 associated specifically with invasive cancer (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.55-0.86, p = 0.001) or adenocarcinomas (OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.17-2.27, p = 0.004), respectively. We tested these and one previously genotyped GWAS variant, rs9272117, for potential eQTL effects on 36 gene transcripts at the HLA locus in 280 cervical epithelial tissues. The strongest eQTL pairs were rs9272117 and HLA-DRB6 (p = 1.9x10E-5), rs1056429 and HLA-DRB5 (p = 2.5x10E-4), and rs535777 and HLA-DRB1 (p = 2.7x10E-4). We also identified transcripts that were specifically upregulated (DDX39B, HCP5, HLA-B, LTB, NFKBIL1) or downregulated (HLA-C, HLA-DPB2) in HPV+ or HPV16+ samples. In comparison, treating cervical epithelial cells with proinflammatory cytokine gamma-IFN led to a dose-dependent induction of HCP5, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB6, and repression of HSPA1L. Taken together, these results identify relevant genes from both the MHC class I and II regions that are inflammation-responsive in cervical epithelium and associate with HPV (HCP5, HLA-B, HLA-C) and/or with genomic cervical cancer risk variants (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB6). They may thus constitute important contributors to the immune escape of precancerous cells after HPV-infection."
39099406,Leveraging Random Effects in Cistrome-Wide Association Studies for Decoding the Genetic Determinants of Prostate Cancer.,"Cistrome-wide association studies (CWAS) are pivotal for identifying genetic determinants of diseases by correlating genetically regulated cistrome states with phenotypes. Traditional CWAS typically develops a model based on cistrome and genotype data to associate predicted cistrome states with phenotypes. The random effect cistrome-wide association study (RECWAS), reevaluates the necessity of cistrome state prediction in CWAS. RECWAS utilizes either a linear model or marginal effect for initial feature selection, followed by kernel-based feature aggregation for association testing is introduced. Through simulations and analysis of prostate cancer data, a thorough evaluation of CWAS and RECWAS is conducted. The results suggest that RECWAS offers improved power compared to traditional CWAS, identifying additional genomic regions associated with prostate cancer. CWAS identified 102 significant regions, while RECWAS found 50 additional significant regions compared to CWAS, many of which are validated. Validation encompassed a range of biological evidence, including risk signals from the GWAS catalog, susceptibility genes from the DisGeNET database, and enhancer-domain scores. RECWAS consistently demonstrated improved performance over traditional CWAS in identifying genomic regions associated with prostate cancer. These findings demonstrate the benefits of incorporating kernel methods into CWAS and provide new insights for genetic discovery in complex diseases."
39098513,Circular RNA hsa_circ_0001610 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging miR-1324 and upregulating PTK6.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and cancer-related deaths are both high in the male population. Once castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has developed, PCa can be difficult to manage. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in the regulation of carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In CRPC, however, the potential molecular mechanisms and biological functions of circRNAs are yet to be defined. In this study, we conducted RNA sequencing on four hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) tumor tissue samples and three CRPC samples. We recognized hsa_circ_0001610, a novel circRNA that was highly expressed in the cells and tissue of CRPC. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to evaluate hsa_circ_0001610 expression. We conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments and found that hsa_circ_0001610 overexpression caused PCa cells to proliferate and migrate and caused enzalutamide resistance. In contrast, the opposite results were found for hsa_circ_0001610 knockdown. We used Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), qRT-PCR, and rescue experiments to reveal the underlying mechanisms of hsa_circ_0001610. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0001610 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-1324 and thus reversed its inhibitory effect on its target gene PTK6. As a result, the PTK6 expression was enhanced, which accelerated PCa progression. The findings of this study confirmed that hsa_circ_0001610 drives the progression of PCa through the hsa_circ_0001610/miR-1324/PTK6 axis. Thus, hsa_circ_0001610 is potentially an effective therapeutic target and specific biomarker for advanced PCa."
39098389,Association Between the Decipher Genomic Classifier and Prostate Cancer Outcome in the Real-world Setting.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although the prognostic significance of the Decipher prostate cancer genomic classifier (GC) has been established largely from analyses of archival tissue, less is known about the associations between the results of Decipher testing and oncologic outcomes among patients receiving contemporaneous testing and treatment in the real-world practice setting. Our objective was to assess the associations between the Decipher GC and risks of metastasis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) following prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) among patients tested and treated in the real-world setting. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a novel longitudinal linkage of transcriptomic data from the Decipher GC and real-world clinical data (RWD) aggregated from insurance claims, pharmacy records, and electronic health record data across payors and sites of care. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to examine the associations between the GC and study outcomes, adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Metastasis from prostate cancer and BCR after radical prostatectomy, Decipher GC continuous score, and risk categories were evaluated. We identified 58 935 participants who underwent Decipher testing, including 33 379 on a biopsy specimen and 25 556 on an RP specimen. The median age was 67 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 62-72) at biopsy testing and 65 yr (IQR 59-69) at RP. The median GC score was 0.43 (IQR 0.27-0.66) among biopsy-tested patients and 0.54 (0.32-0.79) among RP-tested patients. The GC was independently associated with the risk of metastasis among biopsy-tested (hazard ratio [HR] per 0.1 unit increase in GC 1.21 [95% confidence interval CI 1.16-1.27], p < 0.001) and RP-tested (HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.17-1.24], p < 0.001) patients after adjusting for baseline clinical and pathologic risk factors. In addition, the GC was associated with the risk of BCR among RP-tested patients (HR 1.12 [95% CI 1.10-1.14], p < 0.001) in models adjusted for age and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment postsurgical score. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This real-world study of a novel transcriptomic linkage conducted at a national scale supports the external prognostic validity of the Decipher GC among patients managed in contemporary practice. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study looked at the use of the Decipher genomic classifier, a test used to help understand the aggressiveness of a patient's prostate cancer. Looking at the results of 58 935 participants who underwent testing, we found that the Decipher test helped estimate the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis."
39096189,High sensitivity ctDNA assays in genitourinary malignancies: current evidence and future directions.,"In the recent decade, analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has improved cancer care by allowing for rapid detection of actionable molecular targets. A new generation of circulating DNA tests is now becoming available commercially. These tests are characterized by a superior limit of detection of 0.01% vaF or better, allowing for the detection of radiologically occult molecular residual disease (MRD). MRD tests have the potential to revolutionize neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. In addition, these tests can be used as tumor markers to assess disease response. We reviewed the current evidence for the use of high-sensitivity MRD assays with particular focus on the genitourinary tumors. Multiple studies have now been reported in urothelial, renal, and recently testicular carcinoma. We find that the sensitivity varies across tumor types in the adjuvant setting and may reach a high of 100% in urothelial cancer. Specificity in tumor-informed MRD appears to be preserved across tumor types (98%-100%). Several trials are now prospectively validating MRD testing in biomarker integral studies, mainly in urothelial carcinoma."
39096122,Potentially functional variants of ERRFI1 in hypoxia-related genes predict survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia is often involved in tumor microenvironment, and the hypoxia-induced signaling pathways play a key role in aggressive cancer phenotypes, including angiogenesis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. However, it is unknown what role genetic variants in the hypoxia-related genes play in survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We evaluated the associations between 16,092 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 182 hypoxia-related genes and survival outcomes of NSCLC patients. Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were used as the discovery dataset, and the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility (HLCS) Study served as the replication dataset. We also performed additional linkage disequilibrium analysis and a stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis in the PLCO dataset. RESULTS: An independent SNP, ERRFI1 rs28624 A > C, was identified with an adjusted hazards ratio (HR) of 1.31 (95% CI = 1.14-1.51, p = 0.0001) for overall survival (OS). In further analyses, unfavorable genotypes AC and CC, compared with the AA genotype, were associated a worse OS (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39, p = 0.014) and disease-specific survival (HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.04-1.42, p = 0.016). Further expression quantitative trait loci analysis indicated that ERRFI1 rs28624C genotypes were significantly associated with higher ERRFI1 mRNA expression levels in the whole blood. Additional analysis showed that high ERRFI1 mRNA expression levels were associated with a worse OS in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that genetic variants in the hypoxia-related gene ERRFI1 may modulate NSCLC survival, potentially through their effect on the gene expression."
39095857,Analysis of miR-497/195 cluster identifies new therapeutic targets in cervical cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: miR-497/195, located at 17p13.1, is a highly conserved miRNA cluster whose abnormal expression is a key regulator of carcinogenesis. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the miR-497/195 cluster to determine its prognostic utility and role in cervical cancer (CC) using publicly available datasets. RESULTS: In silico analysis and validation revealed that this cluster is downregulated in CC. A total of 60 target genes of miR-497/195 cluster were identified as differentially expressed between normal and CC samples. ShinyGO, STRING, CytoHubba, Timer 2.0, HPA, and HCMBD were used for functional enrichment, PPIN network construction, hub gene identification, immune infiltration correlation, histopathological expression, and determination of the metastatic potential of miR-497/195 cluster and their target genes. PPIN analysis identified CCNE1, CCNE2, ANLN, RACGAP1, KIF23, CHEK1, CDC25A, E2F7, CDK1, and CEP55 as the top 10 hub genes (HGs). Furthermore, the upregulation of RECK, ATD5, and BCL2, downregulation of OSBPL3, RCAN3, and HIST1H3H effected overall survival of CC patients. We identified 6 targets (TFAP2A, CLSPN, RASEF, HIST1H3H, AKT3, and ITPR1) of miR-497/195 cluster to influence metastasis. In addition, 8 druggable genes and 38 potential drugs were also identified. Our study identified miR-497/195 cluster target genes and pathways that could be used for prognostic and therapeutic applications in CC."
39095562,Unveiling novel double-negative prostate cancer subtypes through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.,"Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have facilitated the discovery of previously unrecognized subtypes within prostate cancer (PCa), offering new insights into cancer heterogeneity and progression. In this study, we integrated scRNAseq data from multiple studies, comprising publicly available cohorts and data generated by our research team, and established the Human Prostate Single cell Atlas (HuPSA) and Mouse Prostate Single cell Atlas (MoPSA) datasets. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified two novel double-negative PCa populations: KRT7 cells characterized by elevated KRT7 expression and progenitor-like cells marked by SOX2 and FOXA2 expression, distinct from NEPCa, and displaying stem/progenitor features. Furthermore, HuPSA-based deconvolution re-classified human PCa specimens, validating the presence of these novel subtypes. We then developed a user-friendly web application, ""HuPSA-MoPSA"" ( https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/HuPSA-MoPSA/ ), for visualizing gene expression across all newly established datasets. Our study provides comprehensive tools for PCa research and uncovers novel cancer subtypes that can inform clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies."
39095452,Detection of differentially methylated CpGs between tumour and adjacent benign cells in diagnostic prostate cancer samples.,"Differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) that distinguish prostate tumour from adjacent benign tissue could aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Previously, the identification of such dmCpGs has only been undertaken in radical prostatectomy (RP) samples and not primary diagnostic tumour samples (needle biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate). We interrogated an Australian dataset comprising 125 tumour and 43 adjacent histologically benign diagnostic tissue samples, including 41 paired samples, using the Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip. Regression analyses of paired tumour and adjacent benign samples identified 2,386 significant dmCpGs (Bonferroni p < 0.01; delta-beta >/= 40%), with LASSO regression selecting 16 dmCpGs that distinguished tumour samples in the full Australian diagnostic dataset (AUC = 0.99). Results were validated in independent North American (n(paired) = 19; AUC = 0.87) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n(paired) = 50; AUC = 0.94) RP datasets. Two of the 16 dmCpGs were in genes that were significantly down-regulated in Australian tumour samples (Bonferroni p < 0.01; GSTM2 and PRKCB). Ten additional dmCpGs distinguished low (n = 34) and high Gleason (n = 88) score tumours in the diagnostic Australian dataset (AUC = 0.95), but these performed poorly when applied to the RP datasets (North American: AUC = 0.66; TCGA: AUC = 0.62). The DNA methylation marks identified here could augment and improve current diagnostic tests and/or form the basis of future prognostic tests."
39095302,Neuroendocrine cervical cancer: Have we made any steps forward in its management?,"INTRODUCTION: Neuroendocrine tumors (NEC) were first described by Albores-Saavedra in 1972 and these tumors account for only 0.9% to 1.5% of all invasive cervical cancers.(1,2) The most common type is small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the cervix, which accounts for 80% of cases.2 The poor prognosis despite advances in treatment remains still a huge problem, so the aim of our review is to cover all current therapeutic options. METHOD: We searched for all available interventional studies, reviews, case reports and meta-analyses published from 1995 to 2023. RESULTS: In 2017 Castle et al.(9) published a systematic review and meta-analysis and concluded that SCNC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNC) are, in most cases, caused by HPV, primarily HPV18 and HPV16. Comparative genomics data suggest that cervical NEC may be genetically more similar to common cervical cancer subtypes than to extra-cervical SCNEC of the lung and bladder.(13) Surgery is recommended as the primary treatment in early stages of disease, with radical hysterectomy and nodal assessment followed by adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, simple hysterectomy may be adequate when followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide as additional chemotherapy.(15) Considering that pathologic and clinical behavior is similar to small cell lung cancer, patients usually receive platinum and etoposide as part of their primary therapy.(16) The recurrent disease remains a major clinical problem, because there is no standard treatment modality for these patients, and individualized therapy is recommeded. CONCLUSION: Current therapeutic modalities are mainly based on experience in the treatment of SCNEC of the lung. Certainly, a multidisciplinary approach is very important inorder to design a personalized management plan."
39095299,"Clinical, Imaging, and Technical Factors Associated with Successful Genomic Profiling of Bone Biopsy Tissue in Prostate Cancer.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The source of tissue for genomic profiling of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is often limited to osseous metastases. To guide patient management, metastatic site selection and the technique for targeted bone biopsies are critical for identifying deleterious gene mutations. Our objective was to identify key parameters associated with successful large-panel DNA sequencing. METHODS: We analyzed parameters for 243 men with progressing mCRPC who underwent 269 bone biopsies for genomic profiling between 2014 and 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for clinical, imaging (bone scan; fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] positron emission tomography [PET]; computed tomography [CT]; magnetic resonance imaging), and technical (biopsy site, number of samples, needle gauge) features associated with successful genomic profiling. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 159 of 269 biopsies (59%) generated sufficient tumor material for a genomic profile. Seventy (26%) of the failures were histopathologically negative for mCRPC and 40 (15%) had insufficient tumor for genomic profiling. Of 199 mCRPC samples submitted for molecular testing, 159 (80%) yielded a genomic profile. On univariate analysis, PSA, serum acid phosphatase, number of biopsy samples, FDG PET positivity, CT attenuation, and CT morphology were significantly associated with genomic profiling success. On multivariate analysis, higher FDG maximum standardized uptake value (odds ratio [OR] 7.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.01-18.78; p < 0.001), higher number of biopsy samples (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.49-15.02; p = 0.008), and lower mean CT attenuation (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.18-0.89; p = 0.025) were significantly associated with sequencing success. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In patients with mCRPC, bone biopsies from sites with metabolic activity and lower CT attenuation are associated with higher success rates for genomic profiling via a large-panel DNA sequencing platform. PATIENT SUMMARY: We identified factors associated with successful genetic testing of bone tissue for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Our findings may help in guiding the right scan technique and biopsy site for personalized treatment planning."
39091883,MYC and p53 alterations cooperate through VEGF signaling to repress cytotoxic T cell and immunotherapy responses in prostate cancer.,"Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are generally unresponsive to tumor targeted and immunotherapies. Whether genetic alterations acquired during the evolution of CRPC impact immune and immunotherapy responses is largely unknown. Using our innovative electroporation-based mouse models, we generated distinct genetic subtypes of CRPC found in patients and uncovered unique immune microenvironments. Specifically, mouse and human prostate tumors with MYC amplification and p53 disruption had weak cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration and an overall dismal prognosis. MYC and p53 cooperated to induce tumor intrinsic secretion of VEGF, which by signaling through VEGFR2 expressed on CD8(+) T cells, could directly inhibit T cell activity. Targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in vivo led to CD8(+) T cell-mediated tumor and metastasis growth suppression and significantly increased overall survival in MYC and p53 altered CPRC. VEGFR2 blockade also led to induction of PD-L1, and in combination with PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade produced anti-tumor efficacy in multiple preclinical CRPC mouse models. Thus, our results identify a genetic mechanism of immune suppression through VEGF signaling in prostate cancer that can be targeted to reactivate immune and immunotherapy responses in an aggressive subtype of CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: Though immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies can achieve curative responses in many treatment-refractory cancers, they have limited efficacy in CRPC. Here we identify a genetic mechanism by which VEGF contributes to T cell suppression, and demonstrate that VEGFR2 blockade can potentiate the effects of PD-L1 ICB to immunologically treat CRPC."
39091417,The mutual interplay between NTRK fusion genes and human papillomavirus infection in cervical cancer progression (Review).,"Cervical cancer is a significant global health concern, with a substantial portion of cases attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Recent advancements in molecular profiling have identified distinct subtypes of cervical cancer based on their genomic alterations. One such subgroup is neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive cervical cancers, characterized by gene fusions involving the NTRK genes. Although both NTRK fusion genes and HPV infections are independently recognized as significant risk factors in cervical cancer, their interplay and mutual effects on cancer progression are not yet fully understood. The present review is the first of its kind to explore the potential interplay between NTRK fusion genes and HPV infections. It surveys in detail how their combined effect can influence the signaling pathways during cervical cancer development and progression. Moreover, the present study discussed the clinical features, histopathological examinations, treatment procedures and follow-up outcomes of NTRK-fusion gene-positive cervical cancer. The present review may help in the understanding of the management and treatment of such rare, lethal and resistant cervical cancers."
39090720,Unveiling potential: urinary exosomal mRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for early prostate cancer diagnosis.,"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the use of urinary exosomal mRNA as a potential biomarker for the early detection of prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: Next-generation sequencing was utilized to analyze exosomal RNA from 10 individuals with confirmed PCa and 10 individuals without cancer. Subsequent validation through qRT-PCR in a larger sample of 43 PCa patients and 92 healthy controls revealed distinct mRNA signatures associated with PCa. RESULTS: Notably, mRNAs for RAB5B, WWP1, HIST2H2BF, ZFY, MARK2, PASK, RBM10, and NRSN2 showed promise as diagnostic markers, with AUC values between 0.799 and 0.906 and significance p values. Combining RAB5B and WWP1 in an exoRNA diagnostic model outperformed traditional PSA tests, achieving an AUC of 0.923, 81.4% sensitivity, and 89.1% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential of urinary exosomal mRNA profiling, particularly focusing on RAB5B and WWP1, as a valuable strategy for improving the early detection of PCa."
39083346,Treatment patterns for patients with BRCA1/2-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with BRCA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have an aggressive disease course. This study aimed to describe real-world treatment patterns among patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: De-identified electronic health record data from the Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine Inc. Metastatic Prostate Cancer Clinico-Genomic Database (January 01, 2011 to June 30, 2022) were used to select patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC initiating first-line (1L) therapy with an oncologist-defined advanced line of therapy (LOT) or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) monotherapy. Treatment sequences and reasons for censoring were described in 1L, and among patients who initiated a second-line (2L) therapy. RESULTS: A total of 98 treated patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC were identified. The top 3 treatment regimens in 1L, overall, were ADT monotherapy (19%), enzalutamide (14%), and olaparib (13%). The main reason for censoring patients with ADT monotherapy was death (52.6%). Among 79 patients treated with an advanced LOT in 1L, 43.0% (n = 34) did not initiate a 2L therapy, of which, 29.4% died. In patients who initiated a 2L (n = 45), the most common 1L to 2L treatment sequence was olaparib to docetaxel (11.1%). The most prescribed 2L therapies were docetaxel (22.2%), olaparib (20.0%), abiraterone acetate (13.3%), and enzalutamide (11.1%). From 1L initiation, the median time-to-next-treatment was 6.2 months. CONCLUSION: Among patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC, ADT monotherapy, enzalutamide, and olaparib were most commonly used. Prognosis of BRCA-positive patients was poor, with most patients failing initial therapy resulting in a switch to a new therapy or death. These findings highlight the need for earlier and more effective treatments for patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC."
39082359,"Associations of CYLD, JAK2 and TLR4 Genotypes with PSA Levels and Immunophenotype in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the male urinary system, and its incidence and mortality rates have been increasing worldwide. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) represents stromal and epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate in elderly males. Abnormal activation of inflammation-related signalling molecules, such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) has been linked to the initiation and progression of various human diseases including PCa and BPH. Cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene alterations are associated with PCa progression. In this study, the contribution of CYLD, JAK2, and TLR4 gene variants to PCa and BPH risks and their associations with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, immunophenotype, and clinical features in Vietnamese men were determined. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with PCa, 65 with BPH, and 114 healthy controls were enrolled. The immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry, cytokine secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and gene variants by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Lower levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and higher numbers of CD13+CD117- and CD56+CD25+ cells were observed in the PCa group than in the BPH group. Genetic analysis of the CYLD gene identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which c.2351-47 C>T, c.2351-46A>T, and rs1971432171 T>G had significantly higher frequencies in PCa patients than in the control and BPH groups. Sequencing of the TLR4 gene revealed five nucleotide changes, in which the rs2149356 SNP showed an increased risk for both PCa and BPH and the c.331-206 SNP had a reduced risk for PCa. Importantly, the expansion of activated natural killer (NK) cells and higher levels of PSA were found in PCa patients carrying the CT genotype of the CYLD c.2351-47 compared to those with the wild-type genotype. CONCLUSION: Activation of NK cells in CYLD-sensitive PCa patients was associated with serum PSA release and the CYLD c.2351-47 variant may be a significant risk factor for prostatitis in PCa patients."
39080445,Combined microfluidic enrichment and staining workflow for single-cell analysis of circulating tumor cells in metastatic prostate cancer patients.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are precursors of cancer in the blood and provide an attractive source for dynamic monitoring of disease progression and tumor heterogeneity. However, the scarcity of CTCs in the bloodstream has limited their use in clinical practice. In this study, we present a workflow for easy detection of CTCs by cytokeratin staining using the FDA-cleared Parsortix device for size-based microfluidic enrichment. To minimize sample handling, the isolated cells are stained inside the separation cassette and harvested for subsequent single cell isolation and whole genome copy-number analysis. We validated the workflow on a panel of four prostate cancer cell lines spiked into healthy donor blood collected in CellRescue or EDTA tubes, resulting in mean recoveries of 42% (16-69%). Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical utility in a cohort of 12 metastatic prostate cancer patients and found CTCs in 67% of patients ranging from 0 to 1172 CTCs in 10 mL blood. Additionally, we isolated single patient-derived CTCs and identified genomic aberrations associated with treatment response and clinical outcome. Thus, this workflow provides a readily scalable strategy for analysis of single CTCs, applicable for use in monitoring studies to identify genomic variations important for guiding clinical therapy decision."
39079144,Comparison of Hybribio-H13 and Hybrid Capture(R) 2 human papillomavirus tests for detection of CIN2+ and CIN3.,"INTRODUCTION: Low-cost, accurate high-risk HPV tests are needed for cervical cancer screening in limited-resource settings. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of the low-cost Hybribio-H13 test with the Hybrid Capture(R) 2 to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2 and CIN3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archived baseline samples tested by the Hybrid Capture(R) 2 from women of the ASCUS-COL trial, aged 20 to 69 years, with biopsy-colposcopy directed diagnosis of CIN2+ (n = 143), CIN3+ (n = 51), and < CIN2 (n = 632) were blindly tested by the Hybribio-H13 test. RESULTS: The relative sensitivity of the Hybribio-H13 test versus the Hybrid Capture(R) 2 for detecting CIN2+ was 0.89 (90% CI = 0,80-0,98; NIT = 0,66), and for CIN3+ was 0,92 (90% CI = 0,85-0,98; NIT = 0,35). Relative specificity was 1.19 (90% CI = 1.05-1.33; NIT <0.00001). In the analysis restricted to women older than 30 years, the relative sensitivity of the Hybribio-H13 for CIN3+ was marginally below unity (ratio = 0.97; 90% CI = 0.95-0.99), and the specificity remained higher than the Hybrid Capture(R) 2 test. CONCLUSION: The Hybribio-H13 test was as specific as the Hybrid Capture(R) 2 for detecting CIN2+ or CIN3+ but less sensitive. Considering these results and the young age of the population recruited for screening because of ASCUS cytology, we suggest our results warrant the evaluation of the Hybribio-H13 for screening cervical cancer, especially in the evaluated population."
39078735,Clinical Value of Liquid Biopsy in Patients with FGFR2 Fusion-Positive Cholangiocarcinoma During Targeted Therapy.,"PURPOSE: FGFR2 fusions occur in 10% to 15% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), potentially benefiting from FGFR inhibitors (FGFRi). We aimed to assess the feasibility of detecting FGFR2 fusions in plasma and explore plasma biomarkers for managing FGFRi treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study in 18 patients with iCCA and known FGFR2 fusions previously identified in tissue samples from prior FGFRi treatment. Both tissue and synchronous plasma samples were analyzed using a custom hybrid capture gene panel with next-generation sequencing (VHIO-iCCA panel) and validated against commercial vendor results. Longitudinal plasma analysis during FGFRi was performed. Subsequently, we explored the correlation between plasma biomarkers, liver enzymes, tumor volume, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (88.9%) were positive for FGFR2 fusion events in plasma. Remarkably, the analysis of plasma suggests that lower levels of ctDNA are linked to clinical benefits from targeted therapy and result in improved progression-free survival and overall survival. Higher concentrations of cell-free DNA before FGFRi treatment were linked to worse overall survival, correlating with impaired liver function and indicating compromised cell-free DNA removal by the liver. Additionally, increased ctDNA or the emergence of resistance mutations allowed earlier detection of disease progression compared with standard radiologic imaging methods. CONCLUSIONS: VHIO-iCCA demonstrated accurate detection of FGFR2 fusions in plasma. The integration of information from various plasma biomarkers holds the potential to predict clinical outcomes and identify treatment failure prior to radiologic progression, offering valuable guidance for the clinical management of patients with iCCA."
39075471,Investigating miR-6880-5p in extracellular vesicle from plasma as a prognostic biomarker in endocrine therapy-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Advancements in the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have progressed considerably, but a new biomarker that combines existing clinical and pathological data could be useful for a more precise diagnosis and prognosis. Some investigations have found that extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived miRNAs play crucial roles in various types of malignant tumors. The objective of this study was to explore EV miRNA and identify its biologic function as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of CRPC. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from five healthy donors (Control, CT) and 17 CRPC patients, categorizing into two groups based on their endocrine treatment response: partial response (PR; n = 10) and progressive disease (PD; n = 7). Candidate extracellular vesicle (EV) miRNAs were identified using miRNA microarray and RT-qPCR. The biological functions of the selected miRNAs were evaluated using the MTT assay, wound healing assay, trans-well assay, and RNA sequencing in CRPC cells after transient miRNA expression. RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed a significant downregulation of EV-miR-6880-5p in the PD samples compared to both CT and PR samples (p < 0.01). The expression of EV-miR-6880-5p in CRPC patients was decreased compared with that CT group (p = 0.0336) using RT-qPCR. In the PR group, EV-miR-6880-5p was increased at follow-up compared with the baseline (p = 0.2803), while in the PD group, it decreased at follow-up compared with the baseline samples (p = 0.4356). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-6880-5p hampered cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, downregulated pathways associated with tumor progression, and simultaneously upregulated pathways associated with cell growth and apoptosis in CRPC cells. CONCLUSIONS: EV-miR-6880-5p shows promise as a prognostic biomarker in patients with CRPC. Further, prospective validations are necessary to evaluate the potential of these candidate miRNAs."
39073693,Differential expression of host oncogenes in human papillomavirus-associated nasopharyngeal and cervical epithelial cancers.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical and nasopharyngeal cancers differ in molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic processes. The disparity may be attributed to differential expression of oncoproteins. The current study investigated the host oncogenes expression pattern in HPV-associated cervical and nasopharyngeal cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues originating from the nasopharyngeal and cervical regions were screened using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from confirmed cancer biopsies and non-cancer tissues (NC). HPV was detected by PCR using MY09/GP5+/6+ primers. Protein expression levels of AKT, IQGAP1, and MMP16 in HPV-infected cancers and controls were determined by immunohistochemistry. RT-qPCR was used to profile mRNAs of the oncogenes. AKT and IQGAP1 proteins were highly expressed in the epithelial cancers compared with the non-cancer tissues (p < 0.05). IQGAP1 and MMP16 mRNAs level was significantly higher in the cancers than in the NC (p < 0.05), but not AKT mRNA levels. MMP16 protein was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. AKT mRNA level was significantly elevated in CC compared with NPC (p < 0.001). However, the difference in AKT, IQGAP1 and MMP16 proteins level between CC and NPC was not significant (p > 0.05). The oncoproteins expression level between the HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancer biopsies showed no significant difference (p < 0.05). Current study reports AKT but not IQGAP1 and MMP16 mRNAs differentially expression in cervical and nasopharyngeal cancers, independent of HPV infection status."
39071291,Molecular consequences of acute versus chronic CDK12 loss in prostate carcinoma nominates distinct therapeutic strategies.,"Genomic loss of the transcriptional kinase CDK12 occurs in ~6% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) and correlates with poor patient outcomes. Prior studies demonstrate that acute CDK12 loss confers a homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRd) phenotype via premature intronic polyadenylation (IPA) of key HR pathway genes, including ATM. However, mCRPC patients have not demonstrated benefit from therapies that exploit HRd such as inhibitors of polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Based on this discordance, we sought to test the hypothesis that an HRd phenotype is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 loss and the effect is greatly diminished in prostate cancers adapted to CDK12 loss. Analyses of whole genome sequences (WGS) and RNA sequences (RNAseq) of human mCRPCs determined that tumors with biallelic CDK12 alterations (CDK12 (BAL) ) lack genomic scar signatures indicative of HRd, despite carrying bi-allelic loss and the appearance of the hallmark tandem-duplicator phenotype (TDP). Experiments confirmed that acute CDK12 inhibition resulted in aberrant polyadenylation and downregulation of long genes (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) but such effects were modest or absent in tumors adapted to chronic CDK12 (BAL) . One key exception was ATM, which did retain transcript shortening and reduced protein expression in the adapted CDK12 (BAL) models. However, CDK12 (BAL) cells demonstrated intact HR as measured by RAD51 foci formation following irradiation. CDK12 (BAL) cells showed a vulnerability to targeting of CDK13 by sgRNA or CDK12/13 inhibitors and in vivo treatment of prostate cancer xenograft lines showed that tumors with CDK12 (BAL) responded to the CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835, while CDK12-intact lines did not. Collectively, these studies show that aberrant polyadenylation and long HR gene downregulation is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 deficiency, which is largely compensated for in cells that have adapted to CDK12 loss. These results provide an explanation for why PARPi monotherapy has thus far failed to consistently benefit patients with CDK12 alterations, though alternate therapies that target CDK13 or transcription are candidates for future research and testing."
39068529,"Inhibitory effect of human interleukin-24 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cervical cancer by exploring extensive gene expression datasets to unveil new therapeutic targets. METHODS: Gene expression profiles were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression platforms. A differential expression analysis identified DEGs in cervical cancer cases. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was implemented to locate genes closely linked to the clinical traits of diseases. Machine learning algorithms, including LASSO regression and the random forest algorithm, were applied to pinpoint key genes. RESULTS: The investigation successfully isolated DEGs pertinent to cervical cancer. Interleukin-24 was recognized as a pivotal gene via WGCNA and machine learning techniques. Experimental validations demonstrated that human interleukin (hIL)-24 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis, in SiHa and HeLa cervical cancer cells, affirming its role as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: The multi-database analysis strategy employed herein emphasized hIL-24 as a principal gene in cervical cancer pathogenesis. The findings suggest hIL-24 as a promising candidate for targeted therapy, offering a potential avenue for innovative treatment modalities. This study enhances the understanding of molecular mechanisms of cervical cancer and aids in the pursuit of novel oncological therapies."
39068416,Associations between genetically predicted concentrations of plasma proteins and the risk of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Understanding the proteomic landscape associated with PCa risk can provide insights into its molecular mechanisms and pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions. METHODS: A proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to determine associations between genetically predicted protein concentrations in plasma and PCa risk. From an initial list of 4,364 proteins, significant associations were identified and validated. Multiple sensitivity analyses were also conducted to enhance the robustness of our findings. RESULTS: Of the 4,364 genetically predicted proteins, 308 exhibited preliminary associations with PCa risk. After rigorous statistical refinement, genetically predicted concentrations of 14 proteins showed positive associations with PCa risk, with odds ratios spanning from 1.55 (95% CI 1.28-1.87) for ATG4B to 2.67 (95% CI 1.94-3.67) for HCN1. In contrast, genetically predicted concentrations of ATG7, B2M, MSMB, and TMEM108 demonstrated inverse associations with PCa. The replication analysis further substantiated positive associations for MDH1 and LSM1, and a negative one for MSMB with PCa. A meta-analysis harmonizing primary and replication data mirrored these findings. Furthermore, the MVMR analysis pinpointed B2M and MSMB as having significant associations with PCa risk. CONCLUSION: The genetic evidence unveils a refined set of proteins associated with PCa risk. The findings underscore the potential of these proteins as molecular markers or therapeutic targets for PCa, calling for deeper mechanistic studies and exploration into their translational relevance."
39066515,"CO-19 PDB 2.0: A Comprehensive COVID-19 Database with Global Auto-Alerts, Statistical Analysis, and Cancer Correlations.","Biological databases serve as critical basics for modern research, and amid the dynamic landscape of biology, the COVID-19 database has emerged as an indispensable resource. The global outbreak of Covid-19, commencing in December 2019, necessitates comprehensive databases to unravel the intricate connections between this novel virus and cancer. Despite existing databases, a crucial need persists for a centralized and accessible method to acquire precise information within the research community. The main aim of the work is to develop a database which has all the COVID-19-related data available in just one click with auto global notifications. This gap is addressed by the meticulously designed COVID-19 Pandemic Database (CO-19 PDB 2.0), positioned as a comprehensive resource for researchers navigating the complexities of COVID-19 and cancer. Between December 2019 and June 2024, the CO-19 PDB 2.0 systematically collected and organized 120 datasets into six distinct categories, each catering to specific functionalities. These categories encompass a chemical structure database, a digital image database, a visualization tool database, a genomic database, a social science database, and a literature database. Functionalities range from image analysis and gene sequence information to data visualization and updates on environmental events.

39063957,Synthetic Genitourinary Image Synthesis via Generative Adversarial Networks: Enhancing Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic Precision.,"INTRODUCTION: In the realm of computational pathology, the scarcity and restricted diversity of genitourinary (GU) tissue datasets pose significant challenges for training robust diagnostic models. This study explores the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to mitigate these limitations by generating high-quality synthetic images of rare or underrepresented GU tissues. We hypothesized that augmenting the training data of computational pathology models with these GAN-generated images, validated through pathologist evaluation and quantitative similarity measures, would significantly enhance model performance in tasks such as tissue classification, segmentation, and disease detection. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we employed a GAN model to produce synthetic images of eight different GU tissues. The quality of these images was rigorously assessed using a Relative Inception Score (RIS) of 1.27 +/- 0.15 and a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) that stabilized at 120, metrics that reflect the visual and statistical fidelity of the generated images to real histopathological images. Additionally, the synthetic images received an 80% approval rating from board-certified pathologists, further validating their realism and diagnostic utility. We used an alternative Spatial Heterogeneous Recurrence Quantification Analysis (SHRQA) to assess the quality of prostate tissue. This allowed us to make a comparison between original and synthetic data in the context of features, which were further validated by the pathologist's evaluation. Future work will focus on implementing a deep learning model to evaluate the performance of the augmented datasets in tasks such as tissue classification, segmentation, and disease detection. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the utility of GAN-generated synthetic images in enhancing computational pathology workflows. RESULTS: This study not only confirms the feasibility of using GANs for data augmentation in medical image analysis but also highlights the critical role of synthetic data in addressing the challenges of dataset scarcity and imbalance. CONCLUSIONS: Future work will focus on refining the generative models to produce even more diverse and complex tissue representations, potentially transforming the landscape of medical diagnostics with AI-driven solutions."
39062041,CCZ1 Accelerates the Progression of Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Promoting MMP2/MMP17 Expression.,"Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) represents a significant global health concern among females. Identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets is pivotal for improving the prognosis of CSCC. This study investigates the prognostic relevance of CCZ1 in CSCC and elucidates its downstream pathways and targets using a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. Transcriptomic analysis of 239 CSCC and 3 normal cervical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database reveals a marked upregulation of CCZ1 mRNA levels in CSCC, and elevated CCZ1 mRNA levels were associated with poor prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples also confirmed these findings. Furthermore, functional assays, including Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell, and flow cytometry, elucidated the influence of CCZ1 on CSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression. Remarkably, CCZ1 knockdown suppressed CSCC progression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CCZ1 knockdown downregulated MMP2 and MMP17 expression. Restoring MMP2 or MMP17 expression rescued phenotypic alterations induced by CCZ1 knockdown. Hence, CCZ1 promotes CSCC progression by upregulating MMP2 and MMP17 expression, emerging as a novel biomarker in CSCC and presenting potential as a therapeutic target in CSCC."
39061232,LncRNA LOC730101 Promotes Darolutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Suppressing miR-1-3p.,"Antiandrogen is part of the standard-of-care treatment option for metastatic prostate cancer. However, prostate cancers frequently relapse, and the underlying resistance mechanism remains incompletely understood. This study seeks to investigate whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the resistance against the latest antiandrogen drug, darolutamide. Our RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant overexpression of LOC730101 in darolutamide-resistant cancer cells compared to the parental cells. Elevated LOC730101 levels were also observed in clinical samples of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to primary prostate cancer samples. Silencing LOC730101 with siRNA significantly impaired the growth of darolutamide-resistant cells. Additional RNA sequencing analysis identified a set of genes regulated by LOC730101, including key players in the cell cycle regulatory pathway. We further demonstrated that LOC730101 promotes darolutamide resistance by competitively inhibiting microRNA miR-1-3p. Moreover, by Hi-C sequencing, we found that LOC730101 is located in a topologically associating domain (TAD) that undergoes specific gene induction in darolutamide-resistant cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the crucial role of the lncRNA LOC730101 in darolutamide resistance and its potential as a target for overcoming antiandrogen resistance in CRPC."
39061144,"ENO2, a Glycolytic Enzyme, Contributes to Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Systematic Review of Literature.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the UK and the fifth worldwide. The presence of distant PCa metastasis can reduce the 5-year survival rate from 100% to approximately 30%. Enolase 2 (ENO2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme in cancer metabolism, is associated with the metastasis of multiple cancers and is also used as a marker for neuroendocrine tumours. However, its role in PCa metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we systematically reviewed the current literature to determine the association between ENO2 and metastatic PCa. Medline, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for eligible studies. The search yielded five studies assessing ENO2 expression in PCa patients or cell lines. The three human studies suggested that ENO2 expression is correlated with late-stage, aggressive PCa, including castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC), metastatic CRPC, and neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC). This was further supported by two in vitro studies indicating that ENO2 expression can be regulated by the tumour microenvironment, such as androgen deprived conditions and the presence of bone-forming osteoblasts. Therefore, ENO2 may functionally contribute to PCa metastasis, possibly due to the unique metabolic features of PCa, which are glycolysis dependent only at the advanced metastatic stage."
39061077,Proteomics approach to discovering non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers and understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecological diseases, yet it lacks efficient biomarkers for early detection and unravels disease mechanisms. Proteomic profiling has revealed diverse patterns of protein changes in various clinical samples. Integrating and systematically analysing proteomics data can facilitate the development of biomarkers, expediting diagnosis and providing insights for potential clinical and therapeutic applications. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers in various biological samples and therapeutic targets for endometriosis. METHODS: Online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, and Google Scholar, were searched using MeSH terms. Two independent authors screened the articles, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. GO and KEGG analyses were performed to identify the pathways that were significantly enriched. Protein‑protein interaction and hub gene selection analyses were also conducted to identify biomarker networks for endometriosis. RESULTS: Twenty-six observational studies with a total of 2,486 participants were included. A total of 644 differentially expressed proteins (180 upregulated and 464 downregulated) were identified from 9 studies. Proteins in peripheral blood exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 38-100% and 59-99%, respectively, for detecting endometriosis, while proteins in urine had a sensitivity of 58-91% and specificity of 76-93%. Alpha-1-antitrypsin, albumin, and vitamin D binding proteins were significantly DEPs in both serum and urine. Complement C3 is commonly expressed in serum, menstrual blood, and cervical mucus. Additionally, S100-A8 is commonly expressed in both menstrual blood and cervical mucus. Haptoglobin is commonly detected in both serum and plasma, whereas cathepsin G is found in urine, serum, and plasma. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that proteoglycans in cancer pathways, which regulate cell-to-cell interactions, modulate the extracellular matrix, and promote the proliferation and invasion of endometrial cells, are commonly enriched in serum and urine. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive study revealed potential proteomes that were significantly differentially expressed in women with endometriosis utilizing various non-invasive clinical samples. Exploring common differentially expressed proteins in various biological samples provides insights into the diagnosis and pathophysiology of endometriosis, as well as potential clinical and therapeutic applications."
39061044,Network pharmacology and experimental validation to explore the role and potential mechanism of Liuwei Dihuang Decoction in prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anti-tumor effector of Liuwei Dihuang Decoction (LWDHD) in prostate cancer (PCa) and explore the potential mechanism using experimental validation, network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and molecular docking. METHODS: CCK test, Clone formation assay and wound-healing assays were used to determine the effect of LWDHD on prostate cancer growth and metastasis. The active ingredients and targets of LWDHD were obtained from the TCMSP database, and the relevant targets were selected by GeneCards, OMIM and DisGeNET databases for PCa. The cross-targets of drugs and disease were imported into the STRING database to construct protein interactions. The network was also visualized using Cytoscape software and core targets are screened using the Network Analyzer plug-in. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were analyzed using R software. TCGA database was used to analyze the correlation of bioinformatics genes. AutoDock vina was used to predict the molecular docking and binding ability of active ingredients to key targets. Through WB and q-PCR experiments, the above gene targets were detected to verify the effect of LWDHD on PCa. RESULTS: CCK and scratch tests confirmed that LWDHD could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. Clone formation experiments showed that LWDHD inhibited the long-term proliferative capacity of PC3 cells. LWDHD and PCa had a total of 99 common targets, establishing a ""drug-ingredient-common target"" network. Through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TP53 pathway, MYC, TNF pathway and other signaling pathways were found. Bioinformatics analysis showed that MYC gene was highly expressed and CCND1 and MAPK1 were low expressed in prostate cancer tissues. In addition, TP53, AKT1, MYC, TNF and CCND1 were positively correlated with MAPK1, among which AKT1 and CCND1 were most closely correlated with MAPK1. Molecular docking results showed that quercetin, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol and other main active ingredients of LWDHD treatment for PCa were combined with core proteins MAPK1 and AKT1 well. WB and q-PCR results showed that LWDHD inhibited the expression of PI3K and AKT in PC3 cells. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of LWDHD therapy for PCa is a multi-target and multi-pathway complex process, which may be related to the biological processes mediated by MAPK1 and AKT1 pathways, such as cell proliferation and inhibition of metastasis, and the regulation of signaling pathways. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may be a central pathway of LWDHD to inhibit prostate cancer proliferation."
39060933,Voltage-gated sodium channels in cancers.,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) initiate action potentials in electrically excitable cells and tissues. Surprisingly, some VGSC genes are aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers, derived from ""non-excitable"" tissues that do not generate classic action potentials, showing potential as a promising pharmacological target for cancer. Most of the previous review articles on this topic are limited in scope, and largely unable to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the role of VGSC in cancers. Here, we review the expression patterns of all nine VGSC alpha-subunit genes (SCN1A-11A) and their four regulatory beta-subunit genes (SCN1B-4B). We reviewed data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, complemented by an extensive search of the published papers. We summarized and reviewed previous independent studies and analyzed the VGSC genes in the TCGA database regarding the potential impact of VGSC on cancers. A comparison between evidence gathered from independent studies and data review was performed to scrutinize potential biases in prior research and provide insights into future research directions. The review supports the view that VGSCs play an important role in diagnostics as well as therapeutics of some cancer types, such as breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer. This paper provides an overview of the current knowledge on voltage-gated sodium channels in cancer, as well as potential avenues for further research. While further research is required to fully understand the role of VGSCs in cancer, the potential of VGSCs for clinical diagnosis and treatment is promising."
39055933,Prostate cancer detection through unbiased capture of methylated cell-free DNA.,"Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to reduce mortality but with substantial overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary biopsies. The identification of a highly specific biomarker using liquid biopsies, represents an unmet need in the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer. In this study, we employed a method that enriches for methylated cell-free DNA fragments coupled with a machine learning algorithm which enabled the detection of metastatic and localized cancers with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.74, respectively. The model also detected 51.8% (14/27) of localized and 88.7% (79/89) of patients with metastatic cancer in an external dataset. Furthermore, we show that the differentially methylated regions reflect epigenetic and transcriptomic changes at the tissue level. Notably, these regions are significantly enriched for biologically relevant pathways associated with the regulation of cellular proliferation and TGF-beta signaling. This demonstrates the potential of circulating tumor DNA methylation for prostate cancer detection and prognostication."
39054484,GluOC promotes proliferation and metastasis of TNBC through the ROCK1 signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that is negative for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is highly malignant and aggressive, lacks of corresponding targeted therapy, and has a relatively poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of TNBC development and formulating effective treatment strategies for inducing cell death are still urgent tasks in the treatment of TNBC. Research has shown that uncarboxylated osteocalcin can promote the proliferation of prostate cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and TNBC cells, but the mechanism by which GluOC affects TNBC growth and metastasis needs further study. METHODS: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were used for in vitro cell analysis. Key target molecules or pathways were identified by RNA sequencing, and migration ability was detected by scratch assays, Transwell assays, cell adhesion assays and western blot analysis. Fluorescence staining, colony detection, qRT‒PCR and flow cytometry were used to detect apoptosis, oxidative stress, the cell cycle and the stemness of cancer cells, and a xenotransplantation model in BALB/C nude mice was used for in vivo analysis. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that GluOC facilitates the migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through the ROCK1/MYPT1/MLC2 signalling pathway and promotes the proliferation of TNBC cells via the ROCK1/JAK2/PIK3CA/AKT signalling pathway. Experiments in nude mice demonstrated that GluOC promoted tumour cell proliferation and metastasis in tumour-bearing mice, which further clarified the molecular mechanism of TNBC growth and invasion. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of GluOC in driving TNBC progression and its association with poor patient outcomes. This study clarifies the functional effects of GluOC on TNBC growth, providing insight into the molecular basis of TNBC and potentially providing new ideas for developing targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes."
39054353,Empowering the on-site detection of nucleic acids by integrating CRISPR and digital signal processing.,"Addressing the global disparity in cancer care necessitates the development of rapid and affordable nucleic acid (NA) testing technologies. This need is particularly critical for cervical cancer, where molecular detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) has emerged as an accurate screening method. However, implementing this transition in low- and middle-income countries has been challenging due to the high costs and centralized facilities required for current NA tests. Here, we present CreDiT (CRISPR Enhanced Digital Testing) for on-site NA detection. The CreDiT platform integrates i) a one-pot CRISPR strategy that simultaneously amplifies both target NAs and analytical signals and ii) a robust fluorescent detection based on digital communication (encoding/decoding) technology. These features enable a rapid assay (<35 minutes) in a single streamlined workflow. We demonstrate the sensitive detection of cell-derived HPV DNA targets down to single copies and accurate identification of HPV types in clinical cervical brushing specimens (n = 121)."
39053630,Inhibitors of the transactivation domain of androgen receptor as a therapy for prostate cancer.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a modular transcription factor which functions as a master regulator of gene expression. AR protein is composed of three functional domains; the ligand-binding domain (LBD); DNA-binding domain (DBD); and the intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). AR is transactivated upon binding to the male sex hormone testosterone and other androgens. While the AR may tolerate loss of its LBD, the TAD contains activation function-1 (AF-1) that is essential for all AR transcriptional activity. AR is frequently over-expressed in most prostate cancer. Currently, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the form of surgical or chemical castration remains the standard of care for patients with high risk localized disease, advanced and metastatic disease, and those patients that experience biochemical relapse following definitive primary treatment. Patients with recurrent disease that receive ADT will ultimately progress to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition to ADT not providing a cure, it is associated with numerous adverse effects including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and sexual dysfunction. Recently there has been a renewed interest in investigating the possibility of using antiandrogens which competitively bind the AR-LBD without ADT for patients with hormone sensitive, non-metastatic prostate cancer. Here we describe a class of compounds termed AR transactivation domain inhibitors (ARTADI) and their mechanism of action. These compounds bind to the AR-TAD to inhibit AR transcriptional activity in the absence and presence of androgens. Thus these inhibitors may have utility in preventing prostate cancer growth in the non-castrate setting."
39053228,RNA modification Regulators' Co-Expression Score (RMRCoeS) predicts biochemical recurrence and therapy response in prostate cancer: A multi-omics and experimental validation study.,"BACKGROUND: Owing to the heterogeneity of prostate cancer (PCa), the clinical indicators traditionally fall short of meeting the requirements for personalized medicine. The realm of RNA modification has emerged as an increasingly relevant domain, shedding light on its pivotal role in tumor heterogeneity. However, the specific contributions of RNA modification regulators within the context of PCa remain largely unexplored. METHODS: In this study, we undertook a literature review to summarize the common 8 types of RNA modifications (ac4c, AI, APA, m1A, m5c, m6A, m7G, Psi) encompassing a total of 84 regulators. Moreover, we integrated multi-center cohorts with Ridge regression to develop the Regulators' Co-Expression Score (RMRCoeS). Then we assessed the role of RMRCoeS in several clinical aspects such as biochemical recurrence (BCR), responses to chemotherapy, androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) therapy and immunotherapy in PCa. Finally, we validated the cancer-promoting performance of five hub genes through immunohistochemistry and in vitro assays. RESULTS: Within the mutation landscape of RNA modification regulators, we observed a relatively low overall mutation rate. Remarkably, RMRCoeS, comprising 81 RNA modification regulators, exhibited a notable capability for accurately predicting the prognosis and therapeutic responses in PCa patients subjected to BCR, chemotherapy, ARSI therapy, and immunotherapy. A high RMRCoeS was indicative of a poor prognosis and unfavorable therapy responses. Functional enrichment analysis unveiled that RMRCoeS may exert its influence on PCa progression through various metabolic pathways. Furthermore, a higher RMRCoeS showed a positive correlation with elevated CNV mutations. Lastly, we validated the oncogene effects of CPSF4, WBSCR22, RPUSD3, TRMT61A, and NSUN5-five hub regulators-within the context of PCa. CONCLUSION: The function of different RNA modifications is interconnected. Comprising eight distinct RNA modifications' regulators, RMRCoeS exhibits multifaceted roles in various aspects of PCa, including disease progression, prognosis, and responses to multiple therapies. Furthermore, we provide the initial validation of the oncogene effect associated with WBSCR22, RPUSD3, TRMT61A and NSUN5 in PCa. Our findings offer novel insights into the significance of RNA modifications in PCa personalized medicine."
39052835,USP11 promotes prostate cancer progression by up-regulating AR and c-Myc activity.,"Androgen receptor (AR) is a main driver for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). c-Myc is an oncogene underlying prostate tumorigenesis. Here, we find that the deubiquitinase USP11 targets both AR and c-Myc in prostate cancer (PCa). USP11 expression was up-regulated in metastatic PCa and CRPC. USP11 knockdown (KD) significantly inhibited PCa cell growth. Our RNA-seq studies revealed AR and c-Myc as the top transcription factors altered after USP11 KD. ChIP-seq analysis showed that either USP11 KD or replacement of endogenous USP11 with a catalytic-inactive USP11 mutant significantly decreased chromatin binding by AR and c-Myc. We find that USP11 employs two mechanisms to up-regulate AR and c-Myc levels: namely, deubiquitination of AR and c-Myc proteins to increase their stability and deubiquitination of H2A-K119Ub, a repressive histone mark, on promoters of AR and c-Myc genes to increase their transcription. AR and c-Myc reexpression in USP11-KD PCa cells partly rescued cell growth defects. Thus, our studies reveal a tumor-promoting role for USP11 in aggressive PCa through upregulation of AR and c-Myc activities and support USP11 as a potential target against PCa."
39052257,"BRCA1, BRCA2, and Associated Cancer Risks and Management for Male Patients: A Review.","IMPORTANCE: Half of all carriers of inherited cancer-predisposing variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are male, but the implications for their health are underrecognized compared to female individuals. Germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (also known as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, referred to here as BRCA1/2 PVs) are well known to significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers in female carriers, and knowledge of BRCA1/2 PVs informs established cancer screening and options for risk reduction. While risks to male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs are less characterized, there is convincing evidence of increased risk for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer in males. There has also been a rapid expansion of US Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted cancer therapies, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, for breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers associated with BRCA1/2 PVs. OBSERVATIONS: This narrative review summarized the data that inform cancer risks, targeted cancer therapy options, and guidelines for early cancer detection. It also highlighted areas of emerging research and clinical trial opportunities for male BRCA1/2 PV carriers. These developments, along with the continued relevance to family cancer risk and reproductive options, have informed changes to guideline recommendations for genetic testing and strengthened the case for increased genetic testing for males. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite increasing clinical actionability for male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs, far fewer males than female individuals undergo cancer genetic testing. Oncologists, internists, and primary care clinicians should be vigilant about offering appropriate genetic testing to males. Identifying more male carriers of BRCA1/2 PVs will maximize opportunities for cancer early detection, targeted risk management, and cancer treatment for males, along with facilitating opportunities for risk reduction and prevention in their family members, thereby decreasing the burden of hereditary cancer."
39050513,Dynamic Transcriptional Programs During Single NK Cell Killing: Connecting Form to Function in Cellular Immunotherapy.,"INTRODUCTION: Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies are a promising new method for treating indolent cancer, however engineering new therapies is complex and progress towards therapy for solid tumors is slow. New methods for determining the underlying intracellular signaling driving the killing phenotype would significantly improve this progress. METHODS: We combined single-cell RNA sequencing with live cell imaging of a model system of NK cell killing to correlate transcriptomic data with functional output. A model of NK cell activity, the NK-92 cell line killing of HeLa cervical cancer cells, was used for these studies. NK cell killing activity was observed by microscopy during co-culture with target HeLa cells and killing activity subsequently manually mapped based on NK cell location and Annexin V expression. NK cells from this culture system were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing using the 10x Genomics platform, and transcription factor activity inferred using the Viper and DoRothEA R packages. Luminescent microscopy of reporter constructs in the NK cells was then used to correlate activity of inferred transcriptional activity with killing activity. RESULTS: NK cells had heterogeneous killing activity during 10 h of culture with target HeLa cells. Analysis of the single cell sequencing data identified Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kappaB), Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) and MYC activity as potential drivers of NK cell functional phenotype in our model system. Live cell imaging of the transcription factor activity found NF-kappaB activity was significantly correlated with past killing activity. No correlation was observed between STAT1 or MYC activity and NK cell killing. CONCLUSIONS: Combining luminescent microscopy of transcription factor activity with single-cell RNA sequencing is an effective means of assigning functional phenotypes to inferred transcriptomics data.

39048474,Primer on fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF 7).,"Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), also known as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), is an important member of the FGF family that is mainly expressed by cells of mesenchymal origin while affecting specifically epithelial cells. Thus, FGF7 is widely expressed in diverse tissues, especially in urinary system, gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract), respiratory system, skin, and reproductive system. By interacting specifically with FGFR2-IIIb, FGF7 activates several downstream signal pathways, including Ras, PI3K-Akt, and PLCs. Previous studies of FGF7 mutants also have implicated its roles in various biological processes including development of essential organs and tissue homeostasis in adults. Moreover, more publications have reported that FGF7 and/or FGF7/FGFR2-IIIb-associated signaling pathway are involved in the progression of various heritable or acquired human diseases: heritable conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and non-syndromic cleft lip and palate (NS CLP), where it promotes cyst formation and affects craniofacial development, respectively; acquired non-malignant diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), mucositis, osteoarticular disorders, and metabolic diseases, where it influences inflammation, repair, and metabolic control; and tumorigenesis and malignant diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer, where it enhances cell proliferation, invasion, and chemotherapy resistance. Targeting FGF7 pathways holds therapeutic potential for managing these conditions, underscoring the need for further research to explore its clinical applications. Having more insights into the function and underlying molecular mechanisms of FGF7 is warranted to facilitate the development of effective treatments in the future. Here, we discuss FGF7 genomic structure, signal pathway, expression pattern during embryonic development and in adult organs and mutants along with phenotypes, as well as associated diseases."
39047662,Embryonic microenvironment suppresses YY1 and YY1-related genes in prostate cancer stem cells.,"Yin yang 1 (YY1), a transcription factor, plays crucial roles in cell fate specification, differentiation, and pluripotency during embryonic development. It is also involved in tumorigenesis, drug resistance, metastasis, and relapse caused by cancer stem cells (CSCs), particularly in prostate cancer (PCa). Targeting YY1 could potentially eliminate prostate CSCs (PCSCs) and provide novel therapeutic approaches. PCa tissues often exhibit elevated YY1 expression levels, especially in high-grade cases. Notably, high-grade PCa tissues from 58 PCa patients and CD133(high)/CD44(high) PCSCs isolated from DU145 PCa cell line by FACS both showed significantly increased YY1 expression as observed through immunofluorescence staining, respectively. To investigate the embryonic microenvironment impact on YY1 expression in CSC populations, firstly PCSCs were microinjected into the inner cell mass of blastocysts and then PCSCs were co-cultured with blastocysts. Next Generation Sequencing was used to analyze alterations in YY1 and related gene expressions. Interestingly, exposure to the embryonic microenvironment significantly reduced the expressions of YY1, YY2, and other relevant genes in PCSCs. These findings emphasize the tumor-suppressing effects of the embryonic environment by downregulating YY1 and YY1-related genes in PCSCs, thus providing promising strategies for PCa therapy. Through elucidating the mechanisms involved in embryonic reprogramming and its effects on YY1 expression, this research offers opportunities for further investigation into focused therapies directed against PCSCs, therefore enhancing the outcomes of PCa therapy. As a result, PCa tumors may benefit from YY1 and associated genes as a novel therapeutic target."
39047373,Distinctive expression and cellular localisation of zinc homeostasis-related proteins in breast and prostate cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Zinc transport proteins (ZIP and ZnT), metallothioneins (MT) and protein kinase CK2 are involved in dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in breast and prostate cancer cells. Following up our previous research, we targeted ZIP12, ZnT1, MT2A and CK2 in this study by investigating their expression levels and protein localisation. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy were employed to quantify the expression of ZIP12, ZnT1, MT2A and CK2 subunits in a panel of breast and prostate cell lines without or with extracellular zinc exposure. The cellular localisations of these target proteins were also examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. RESULTS: In response to the extracellular zinc exposure, the gene expression was elevated for SLC39A12 (ZIP12), SLC30A1 (ZnT1) and MT2A (MT2A) in normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) in contrast to their cancerous counterparts (PC3 and DU145), whilst the gene expression was higher for SLC39A12 (ZIP12) and SLC30A1 (ZnT1) in both normal (MCF10A) and basal breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) compared to luminal breast cancer cells (MCF-7). At the protein level, the expression for both ZIP12 and ZnT1 was trending lower in the time course for the breast cancer cells whilst their expression was remained constant in the normal breast epithelial cells. The expression of ZIP12 in prostate cancer cells was higher than the normal prostate cells. The protein expression for CK2 alpha/alphaꞌ and CK2beta was markedly higher in prostate cancer cells than the normal prostate cells. Upon extracellular zinc exposure, ZIP12 was, for the first time, conspicuously localised in the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells but not in normal breast epithelial cells and prostate cells. ZnT1 is only localised in the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. MT2A is distinctively seen close to the plasma membrane in breast cancer cells. CK2 is also for the first time shown to be localised in proximity to the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The findings, particularly the localisation of ZIP12 and CK2, are novel and significant for our understanding of zinc homeostasis in breast and prostate cancer cells."
39044302,Prostate cancers with distinct transcriptional programs in Black and White men.,"BACKGROUND: Black men are at a higher risk of prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis and present with more high-grade PC than White men in an equal access setting. This study aimed to identify differential transcriptional regulation between Black and White men with PC. METHODS: We performed microarray of radical prostatectomy tissue blocks from 305 Black and 238 White men treated at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Differential expression, gene set enrichment analysis, master regulator analysis, and network modeling were conducted to compare gene expression by race. Findings were validated using external datasets that are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The first was a multi-institutional cohort of 1152 prostate cancer patients (596 Black, 556 White) with microarray data (GEO ID: GSE169038). The second was an Emory cohort of 106 patients (22 Black, 48 White, 36 men of unknown race) with RNA-seq data (GEO ID: GSE54460). Additionally, we analyzed androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding profiles using paired AR ChIP-Seq datasets from Black and White men (GEO IDs: GSE18440 and GSE18441). RESULTS: We identified 871 differentially expressed genes between Black and White men. White men had higher activity of MYC-related pathways, while Black men showed increased activity of inflammation, steroid hormone responses, and cancer progression-related pathways. We further identified the top 10 transcription factors (TFs) in Black patients, which formed a transcriptional regulatory network centered on the AR. The activities of this network and the pathways were significantly different in Black vs. White men across multiple cohorts and PC molecular subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest PC in Black and White men have distinct tumor transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, a highly interactive TF network centered on AR drives differential gene expression in Black men. Additional study is needed to understand the degree to which these differences in transcriptional regulatory elements contribute to PC health disparities."
39043220,COL5A1 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in human cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor in women. This study aims to detect collagen type V alpha1 chain (COL5A1) expression and its clinical relevance in the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. METHODS: Cervical cancer tissues and their paired adjacent normal tissues were prepared for tissue microarray. The expression of COL5A1 protein and the scores of the expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The prognostic value of COL5A1 was analyzed by R software version 4.2.1 with ""survival, survminer, ggplot2"" packages and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). The cBioPortal database was utilized for the analysis of COL5A1 gene mutations. RESULTS: COL5A1 protein was overexpressed in human cervical cancer tissues compared to their paired adjacent normal tissues detected by IHC (P < 0.001). High expression of COL5A1 tends to be in elderly patients with cervical cancer. Survival analyses of clinical data of patients with cervical cancer showed that a high level of COL5A1 expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (P = 0.031) and disease-free survival (P = 0.042) of patients. Further analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas-Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and the GEPIA survival datasets confirmed the association of high COL5A1 expression with poor overall survival of patients (P = 0.040 and P = 0.018, respectively). The analysis of genomic alterations of COL5A1 using the cBioPortal tool revealed that the COL5A1 gene was altered in 4% of cervical cancer patients and COL5A1 corresponding protein alterations with post-translational modifications were hydroxylation. CONCLUSION: COL5A1 is a tissue biomarker correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with cervical cancer, which may lead to a new clinical application."
39039845,Novel ectopic expression of zona pellucida 3 glycoprotein in lung cancer promotes tumor growth.,"Zona pellucida 3 (ZP3) expression is classically found in the ZP-layer of the oocytes, lately shown in ovarian and prostate cancer. A successful ZP3 ovarian cancer immunotherapy in transgenic mice suggested its use as an attractive therapeutic target. The biological role of ZP3 in cancer growth and progression is still unknown. We found that ~88% of the analyzed adenocarcinoma, squamous and small cell lung carcinomas to express ZP3. Knockout of ZP3 in a ZP3-expressing lung adenocarcinoma cell line, significantly decreased cell viability, proliferation, and migration rates in vitro. Zona pellucida 3 knock out (ZP3-KO) cell tumors inoculated in vivo in immunodeficient non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient mice showed significant inhibition of tumor growth and mitigation of the malignant phenotype. RNA sequencing revealed the deregulation of cell migration/adhesion signaling pathways in ZP3-KO cells. This novel functional relevance of ZP3 in lung cancer emphasized the suitability of ZP3 as a target in cancer immunotherapy and as a potential cancer biomarker."
39038742,"Autophagy in aging-related diseases and cancer: Principles, regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential.","Macroautophagy/autophagy is primarily accountable for the degradation of damaged organelles and toxic macromolecules in the cells. Regarding the essential function of autophagy for preserving cellular homeostasis, changes in, or dysfunction of, autophagy flux can lead to disease development. In the current paper, the complicated function of autophagy in aging-associated pathologies and cancer is evaluated, highlighting the underlying molecular mechanisms that can affect longevity and disease pathogenesis. As a natural biological process, a reduction in autophagy is observed with aging, resulting in an accumulation of cell damage and the development of different diseases, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The MTOR, AMPK, and ATG proteins demonstrate changes during aging, and they are promising therapeutic targets. Insulin/IGF1, TOR, PKA, AKT/PKB, caloric restriction and mitochondrial respiration are vital for lifespan regulation and can modulate or have an interaction with autophagy. The specific types of autophagy, such as mitophagy that degrades mitochondria, can regulate aging by affecting these organelles and eliminating those mitochondria with genomic mutations. Autophagy and its specific types contribute to the regulation of carcinogenesis and they are able to dually enhance or decrease cancer progression. Cancer hallmarks, including proliferation, metastasis, therapy resistance and immune reactions, are tightly regulated by autophagy, supporting the conclusion that autophagy is a promising target in cancer therapy."
39038206,"Guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology for anatomopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular testing in female tumors.","INTRODUCTION: Precision medicine has revolutionized oncology, providing more personalized diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring for patients with cancer. In the context of female-specific tumors, such as breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancer, proper tissue collection and handling are essential for obtaining tissue, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular data to guide therapeutic decisions. OBJECTIVES: To establish guidelines for the collection and handling of tumor tissue, to enhance the quality of samples for histopathological, IHC, genomic, and molecular analyses. These guidelines are fundamental in informing therapeutic decisions in cancer treatment. METHOD: The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of renowned specialists between June 12, 2013 and February 12, 2024. Initially, the panel deliberated on critical and controversial topics related to conducting precision medicine studies focusing on female tumors. Subsequently, 22 pivotal topics were identified within the framework and assigned to groups. These groups reviewed relevant literature and drafted preliminary recommendations. Following this, the recommendations were reviewed by the coordinators and received unanimous approval. Finally, the groups made the final adjustments, classified the level of evidence, and ranked the recommendations. CONCLUSION: The collection of surgical samples requires minimum quality standards to enable histopathological, IHC, genomic, and molecular analyses. These analyses provide crucial data for informing therapeutic decisions, significantly impacting potential survival gains for patients with female tumors."
39038086,Demystifying the Contemporary Role of 12-Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"For almost two decades, 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been the only class I recommendation on DAPT in American and European guidelines, which has resulted in 12-month durations of DAPT therapy being the most frequently implemented in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) across the globe. Twelve-month DAPT was initially grounded in the results of the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial, which, by design, studied DAPT versus no DAPT rather than the optimal DAPT duration. The average DAPT duration in this study was 9 months, not 12 months. Subsequent ACS studies, which were not designed to assess DAPT duration, rather its composition (aspirin with prasugrel or ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel) were further interpreted as supportive evidence for 12-month DAPT duration. In these studies, the median DAPT duration was 9 or 15 months for ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively. Several subsequent studies questioned the 12-month regimen and suggested that DAPT duration should either be fewer than 12 months in patients at high bleeding risk or more than 12 months in patients at high ischemic risk who can safely tolerate the treatment. Bleeding, rather than ischemic risk assessment, has emerged as a treatment modifier for maximizing the net clinical benefit of DAPT, due to excessive bleeding and no clear benefit of prolonged treatment regimens in high bleeding risk patients. Multiple DAPT de-escalation treatment strategies, including switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel, reducing the dose of prasugrel or ticagrelor, and shortening DAPT duration while maintaining monotherapy with ticagrelor, have been consistently shown to reduce bleeding without increasing fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular or cerebral ischemic risks compared with 12-month DAPT. However, 12-month DAPT remains the only class-I DAPT recommendation for patients with ACS despite the lack of prospectively established evidence, leading to unnecessary and potentially harmful overtreatment in many patients. It is time for clinical practice and guideline recommendations to be updated to reflect the totality of the evidence regarding the optimal DAPT duration in ACS."
39037763,Recombinant origin and interspecies transmission of a HERV-K(HML-2)-related primate retrovirus with a novel RNA transport element.,"HERV-K(HML-2), the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K(HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism."
39036755,Does androgenic alopecia aggravate the risk of prostate cancer? Evidence from Mendelian randomization.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological reports indicate a potential association between androgenic alopecia (AGA) and increased prostate cancer (PC) prevalence, but conflicting reports also exist. This study aims to elucidate the causality of AGA on PC risk using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-sample MR analyses utilized public genome-wide association studies summary data for single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with AGA. Four statistical methods were used: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode, with IVW as the preliminary estimation method. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to address pleiotropic bias. RESULTS: Genetically proxied AGA did not demonstrate a causal effect on PC risk (IVW P > 0.05). Consistently, complementary methods yielded results aligned with IVW. CONCLUSIONS: Our MR analysis indicates no causal relationship between genetically predicted AGA and PC risk, suggesting that observed associations in epidemiological studies may not be causal."
39036754,The impact of obesity and sexual behavior on prostate cancer risk is mediated by testosterone levels: a mendelian randomization study and mediation analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between obesity, sexual behavior, and prostate cancer (PCa) has been widely debated, contributing to a lack of understanding of its potential mechanisms and hindering the development of effective prevention measures. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the causal effect of body mass index (BMI), age at first sexual intercourse (AFS), and bioavailable testosterone levels on PCa while also quantifying the potential roles of mediators. METHOD: We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study using summary statistics from genome-wide associations of BMI (152,893 European males), AFS (182,791 European males), bioavailable testosterone (184,205 European males), and PCa (79,148 cases, 61,106 controls, European ancestry). Inverse-variance weighted method, weighted median method, MR-Egger regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and outlier test were used for MR analyses. Reverse MR and mediation analysis were performed. Data analyses were conducted from December 2022 to July 2023. RESULTS: The results showed that genetic liability to BMI was protective of PCa (OR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74-0.91; P = 3.29 x 10(-4)). Genetic liability to later AFS (OR, 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08-1.53; P = 5.64 x 10(-3)) and higher bioavailable testosterone levels (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24, P = 0.04) were associated with an increased risk of PCa. All of these potential causal effects could only be forwarded and were not affected by prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. After controlling for bioavailable testosterone levels, the causal impact of BMI and AFS on PCa was no longer significant. The mediation analysis suggested that the causal influence of AFS/BMI on PCa relied on bioavailable testosterone levels. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the difference between the univariable and multivariable MR results suggested that the causal influence of BMI and AFS on PCa relied on bioavailable testosterone levels. Further work is needed to identify other risk factors and to elucidate the specific mechanisms that underlie this causal pathway."

This clinical observational study investigates the therapeutic mechanisms of Bufei Huoxue capsules (BHC) in treating PH in patients with COPD-linked PH (COPD-PH) using network pharmacology and molecular docking methods, and assesses the therapeutic efficacy and safety of BHCs. The active compounds and their target proteins in BHCs were sourced from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database, with additional target proteins derived from the GeneCards and OMIM databases. An active network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.1, and interaction networks were established. Intersecting targets underwent Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis using the Metascape database. Network pharmacology and molecular docking studies demonstrated favorable binding affinities of BHC active ingredients, such as quercetin, bavachalcone, and isobavachin, for key targets including PTGS1, ESR1, and PTGS2. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis highlighted the involvement of these targets in processes such as the positive regulation of locomotion, the transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation. KEGG pathway analysis indicated their roles in pathways related to cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications, and prostate cancer. BHCs exhibit therapeutic effects on COPD-PH through multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway interactions. This clinical observational study confirms the efficacy and safety of BHCs in improving cardiac and pulmonary functions, enhancing exercise tolerance, and elevating the quality of life in patients with COPD-PH."

39032952,Multiplexed quantitative proteomics in prostate cancer biomarker development.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin cancer among men in the United States. However, the widely used protein biomarker in PCa, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), while useful for initial detection, its use alone cannot detect aggressive PCa and can lead to overtreatment. This chapter provides an overview of PCa protein biomarker development. It reviews the state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies for PCa biomarker development, such as enhancing the detection sensitivity of low-abundance proteins through antibody-based or antibody-independent protein/peptide enrichment, enriching post-translational modifications such as glycosylation as well as information-rich extracellular vesicles, and increasing accuracy and throughput using advanced data acquisition methodologies. This chapter also summarizes recent PCa biomarker validation studies that applied those techniques in diverse specimen types, including cell lines, tissues, proximal fluids, urine, and blood, developing novel protein biomarkers for various clinical applications, including early detection and diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention of PCa."
39032948,The glycosylation landscape of prostate cancer tissues and biofluids.,"An overview of the role of glycosylation in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression is presented, focusing on recent advancements in defining the N-glycome through glycomic profiling and glycoproteomic methodologies. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification typified by oligosaccharides attached N-linked to asparagine or O-linked to serine or threonine on carrier proteins. These attached sugars have crucial roles in protein folding and cellular recognition processes, such that altered glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer pathogenesis and progression. In the past decade, advancements in N-glycan profiling workflows using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) technology have been applied to define the spatial distribution of glycans in PCa tissues. Multiple studies applying N-glycan MALDI-MSI to pathology-defined PCa tissues have identified significant alterations in N-glycan profiles associated with PCa progression. N-glycan compositions progressively increase in number, and structural complexity due to increased fucosylation and sialylation. Additionally, significant progress has been made in defining the glycan and glycopeptide compositions of prostatic-derived glycoproteins like prostate-specific antigen in tissues and biofluids. The glycosyltransferases involved in these changes are potential drug targets for PCa, and new approaches in this area are summarized. These advancements will be discussed in the context of the further development of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics targeting glycans and glycoproteins associated with PCa progression. Integration of large scale spatial glycomic data for PCa with other spatial-omic methodologies is now feasible at the tissue and single-cell levels."

39031745,Common and novel haplotype structures between different types of cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with cancer risk. GWAS data are important for cancer prevention and understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the genetic association between different types of cancer using GWAS data and a bioinformatics approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: The significant GWAS variants associated with more than one cancer type were identified. Common linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants between different types of cancer were identified by 1000 genomes phase 3 LD data. Haplotype blocks were identified by analyzing 1000 Genomes phase 3 genotyping data in the GWAS populations. Subsequent analyses included functional SNP analyses and TCGA gene expression. The results associated with significant GWAS variants (P<5E-8) showed the following haplotype associations in European population: GT rs4808075-rs8170 haplotype on BABAM1 with breast and ovarian cancers, GC rs16857609-rs11693806 haplotype on DIRC3 with breast and thyroid cancers, GCG rs380286-rs401681-rs31487 haplotype on CLPTM1L with skin and lung cancers, GGG rs4430796-rs11651052-rs11263763 haplotype on HNF1B with prostate and endometrial cancers, and GT rs10505477-rs6983267 haplotype on CASC8 associated with colorectal and prostate cancers. All these genes had significantly different expressions in tumor tissues (P<1E-3). In addition, the rs11693806 variant is located in the hsa-miR-873-5p binding site and has an enhancing effect on the hsa-miR-873-5p:DIRC3 interaction. CONCLUSION: These novel haplotype structures and miRNA:lncRNA interactions are important for understanding the common genetic link between cancers. These results can potentially be used in genetic panels."
39031642,Correlation analyses of radiographic progression-free survival with clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Analysis of the phase 3 VISION trial.,"BACKGROUND: [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 ((177)Lu-PSMA-617) plus protocol-permitted standard of care (SOC) prolonged overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) versus SOC in patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the phase 3 VISION study, in addition to beneficial effects on symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Post hoc analyses used the full analysis set from the VISION study (N = 831) overall and by randomized treatment arm ((177)Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC, n = 551; SOC, n = 280). Correlations were determined between OS and rPFS and between rPFS or OS and time to SSE or to worsening HRQOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P] and 5-level EQ-5D [EQ-5D-5L]). Correlation analyses used an iterative multiple imputation copula-based approach (correlation coefficients [rho] of <0.3 were defined as weak, >/=0.3 and <0.5 as mild, >/=0.5 and <0.7 as moderate, and >/=0.7 as strong). RESULTS: In the overall population, rPFS correlated strongly with OS (rho, >/=0.7). Correlations between rPFS or OS and time to SSE without death were weak or mild. Time to worsening in the FACT-P total score and emotional and physical well-being domains correlated mildly or moderately with rPFS and moderately with OS. Correlation coefficients for time-to-worsening EQ-5D-5L scores were mild to moderate for both rPFS and OS. Correlation coefficients were similar between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of the VISION study, rPFS correlated strongly with OS but not with time to SSE or worsening HRQOL. These findings require further investigation."
39029755,Environmental explanation of prostate cancer progression based on the comprehensive analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls.,"OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have caused great environmental concerns. The study aims to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms between PCBs exposure and prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: To investigate the association between PCBs exposure and prostate cancer by using CTD, TCGA, and GEO datasets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to explore pathways associated with PCBs-related genes (PRGs). Using Lasso regression analysis, a novel PCBs-related prognostic model was developed. Both internal and external validations were conducted to assess the model's validity. Molecular docking was utilized to assess the binding capacity of PCBs to crucial genes. At last, preliminary experimental validations were conducted to confirm the biological roles of Aroclor 1254 in PCa cells. RESULTS: The GO enrichment analysis of PRGs revealed that the biological processes were most enriched in the regulation of transcription from the RNA polymerase II promoter and signal transduction. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that of the pathways in cancer is the most significantly enriched. Next, a PCBs-related model was constructed. In the training, test, GSE70770, and GSE116918 cohorts, the biochemical recurrences free survival of the patients with high-risk scores was considerably lower. The AUCs at 5 years were 0.691, 0.718, 0.714, and 0.672 in the four cohorts, demonstrating the modest predictive ability. A nomogram that incorporated clinical characteristics was constructed. The results of the anti-cancer drug sensitivity analysis show chemotherapy might be more beneficial for patients at low risk. The molecular docking analysis demonstrated PCBs' ability to bind to crucial genes. PCa cells exposed to Aroclor 1254 at a concentration of 1 muM showed increased proliferation and invasion capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the function of PCBs in PCa and accentuates the need for deeper exploration into the mechanistic links between PCBs exposure and PCa progression."
39029427,Intestinal microbiota composition is predictive of radiotherapy-induced acute gastrointestinal toxicity in prostate cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: The search for factors beyond the radiotherapy dose that could identify patients more at risk of developing radio-induced toxicity is essential to establish personalised treatment protocols for improving the quality-of-life of survivors. To investigate the role of the intestinal microbiota in the development of radiotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, the MicroLearner observational cohort study characterised the intestinal microbiota of 136 (discovery) and 79 (validation) consecutive prostate cancer patients at baseline radiotherapy. METHODS: Gastrointestinal toxicity was assessed weekly during RT using CTCAE. An average grade >1.3 over time points was used to identify patients suffering from persistent acute toxicity (endpoint). The microbiota of patients was quantified from the baseline faecal samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology and the Ion Reporter metagenomic pipeline. Statistical techniques and computational and machine learning tools were used to extract, functionally characterise, and predict core features of the bacterial communities of patients who developed acute gastrointestinal toxicity. FINDINGS: Analysis of the core bacterial composition in the discovery cohort revealed a cluster of patients significantly enriched for toxicity, displaying a toxicity rate of 60%. Based on selected high-risk microbiota compositional features, we developed a clinical decision tree that could effectively predict the risk of toxicity based on the relative abundance of genera Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Prevotella and Phascolarctobacterium both in internal and external validation cohorts. INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence showing that intestinal bacteria profiling from baseline faecal samples can be effectively used in the clinic to improve the pre-radiotherapy assessment of gastrointestinal toxicity risk in prostate cancer patients.

39028815,R-loop resolution by ARIP4 helicase promotes androgen-mediated transcription induction.,"Pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at transcription start sites (TSSs) primes target genes for productive elongation. Coincidentally, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) enrich at highly transcribed and Pol II-paused genes, although their interplay remains undefined. Using androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a model, we have uncovered AR-interacting protein 4 (ARIP4) helicase as a driver of androgen-dependent transcription induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis revealed that ARIP4 preferentially co-occupies TSSs with paused Pol II. Moreover, we found that ARIP4 complexes with topoisomerase II beta and mediates transient DSB formation upon hormone stimulation. Accordingly, ARIP4 deficiency compromised release of paused Pol II and resulted in R-loop accumulation at a panel of highly transcribed AR target genes. Last, we showed that ARIP4 binds and unwinds R-loops in vitro and that its expression positively correlates with prostate cancer progression. We propose that androgen stimulation triggers ARIP4-mediated unwinding of R-loops at TSSs, enforcing Pol II pause release to effectively drive an androgen-dependent expression program."

39026058,Hypoxic Regulation of the KLK4 Gene in two Different Prostate Cancer Cells Treated with TGF- beta.,"The human kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family which consists of 15 members is associated with prostate cancer and other cancers. It has been reported that overexpression of KLK4 in prostate cancer correlates with bone metastasis or advanced stage. Hypoxia occurs in the early stages of prostate cancer due to the accumulation of acidic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). In our study, KLK4 gene expression in hypoxic conditions in PC-3 and LNCaP cells which are treated with TGF-beta was evaluated with mRNA, protein, and promoter activity levels. A chemical hypoxia model was created and confirmed at mRNA and protein level. No statistically significant cytotoxic effect of CoCl(2) and TGF-beta was observed in PC-3 and LNCaP cells with the MTT test. Four different truncated KLK4 gene promoter constructs were cloned in pmetLuc expression vector and basal activities of all promoter fragments were analyzed. The activities of P1 (-447/ + 657), P2 (-103/ + 657), and P3 (-267/ + 657) promoter fragments increased in hypoxic conditions except P4 (+555/ + 657), which does not contain the SMAD and HRE region. KLK4 mRNA levels in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells increased in the hypoxia and hypoxia/TGF groups compared to the non-treated groups. The stimulating effect of TGF-beta is correlated with the increase in SMAD2/3 mRNA levels. KLK4 expression is up-regulated by TGF-beta, especially under hypoxic conditions, and its interaction with the SMAD pathway is determined with different inhibitor experiments. HIF-1alpha and SMAD transcription factors bind to the KLK4 promoter showing the direct interaction of HIF-1alpha (-80/-52) and SMAD (+163/+194) regions with EMSA."
39025880,Integrating muti-omics data to identify tissue-specific DNA methylation biomarkers for cancer risk.,"The relationship between tissue-specific DNA methylation and cancer risk remains inadequately elucidated. Leveraging resources from the Genotype-Tissue Expression consortium, here we develop genetic models to predict DNA methylation at CpG sites across the genome for seven tissues and apply these models to genome-wide association study data of corresponding cancers, namely breast, colorectal, renal cell, lung, ovarian, prostate, and testicular germ cell cancers. At Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05, we identify 4248 CpGs that are significantly associated with cancer risk, of which 95.4% (4052) are specific to a particular cancer type. Notably, 92 CpGs within 55 putative novel loci retain significant associations with cancer risk after conditioning on proximal signals identified by genome-wide association studies. Integrative multi-omics analyses reveal 854 CpG-gene-cancer trios, suggesting that DNA methylation at 309 distinct CpGs might influence cancer risk through regulating the expression of 205 unique cis-genes. These findings substantially advance our understanding of the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and gene expression in cancer etiology."
39025852,Targeting valine catabolism to inhibit metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer.,"Metabolic reprogramming and energetic rewiring are hallmarks of cancer that fuel disease progression and facilitate therapy evasion. The remodelling of oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced lipogenesis have previously been characterised as key metabolic features of prostate cancer (PCa). Recently, succinate-dependent mitochondrial reprogramming was identified in high-grade prostate tumours, as well as upregulation of the enzymes associated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism. In this study, we hypothesised that the degradation of the BCAAs, particularly valine, may play a critical role in anapleurotic refuelling of the mitochondrial succinate pool, as well as the maintenance of intracellular lipid metabolism. Through the suppression of BCAA availability, we report significantly reduced lipid content, strongly indicating that BCAAs are important lipogenic fuels in PCa. This work also uncovered a novel compensatory mechanism, whereby fatty acid uptake is increased in response to extracellular valine deprivation. Inhibition of valine degradation via suppression of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) resulted in a selective reduction of malignant prostate cell proliferation, decreased intracellular succinate and impaired cellular respiration. In combination with a comprehensive multi-omic investigation that incorporates next-generation sequencing, metabolomics, and high-content quantitative single-cell imaging, our work highlights a novel therapeutic target for selective inhibition of metabolic reprogramming in PCa."
39025841,The PP2A regulator IER5L supports prostate cancer progression.,"Prostate cancer exhibits high prevalence and accounts for a high number of cancer-related deaths. The discovery and characterization of molecular determinants of aggressive prostate cancer represents an active area of research. The Immediate Early Response (IER) family of genes, which regulate Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, has emerged among the factors that influence cancer biology. Here, we show that the less studied member of this family, Immediate Early Response 5 like (IER5L), is upregulated in aggressive prostate cancer. Interestingly, the upregulation of IER5L expression exhibits a robust association with metastatic disease in prostate and is recapitulated in other cancer types. In line with this observation, IER5L silencing reduces foci formation, migration and invasion ability in a variety of human and murine prostate cancer cell lines. In vivo, using zebrafish and immunocompromised mouse models, we demonstrate that IER5L-silencing reduces prostate cancer tumor growth, dissemination, and metastasis. Mechanistically, we characterize the transcriptomic and proteomic landscapes of IER5L-silenced cells. This approach allowed us to identify DNA replication and monomeric G protein regulators as downstream programs of IER5L through a pathway that is consistent with the regulation of PP2A. In sum, we report the alteration of IER5L in prostate cancer and beyond and provide biological and molecular evidence of its contribution to tumor aggressiveness."

39025646,(61)Cu-PSMA-Targeted PET for Prostate Cancer: From Radiotracer Development to First-in-Human Imaging.,"The demand for PET tracers that target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) continues to increase. Meeting this demand with approved (68)Ga- and (18)F-labeled PSMA tracers is challenging outside of major urban centers. This is because the short physical half-life of these radionuclides makes it necessary to produce them near their sites of usage. To overcome this challenge, we propose cyclotron-produced (61)Cu for labeling PSMA PET tracers. (61)Cu can be produced on a large scale, and its 3.33-h half-life allows shipping over considerably longer distances than possible for (68)Ga and (18)F. Production of true theranostic twins using (61)Cu and the beta(-)-emitter (67)Cu is also feasible. Methods: PSMA-I&T (DOTAGA-(l-y)fk(sub-KuE)) and its derivative in which the DOTAGA chelator was replaced by NODAGA (NODAGA-(l-y)fk(sub-KuE)), herein reported as DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and NODAGA-PSMA-I&T, respectively, were labeled with (61)Cu and compared with [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T, [(68)Ga]Ga-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T, [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, and [(18)F]PSMA-1007. In vitro (lipophilicity, affinity, cellular uptake, and distribution) and in vivo (PET/CT, biodistribution, and stability) studies were performed in LNCaP cells and xenografts. Human dosimetry estimates were calculated for [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T. First-in-human imaging with [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T was performed in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer. Results: [(61)Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T were synthesized with radiochemical purity of more than 97%, at an apparent molar activity of 24 MBq/nmol, without purification after labeling. In vitro, natural Cu ((nat)Cu)-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and (nat)Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T showed high affinity for PSMA (inhibitory concentration of 50%, 11.2 +/- 2.3 and 9.3 +/- 1.8 nM, respectively), although lower than the reference (nat)Ga-PSMA-11 (inhibitory concentration of 50%, 2.4 +/- 0.4 nM). Their cellular uptake and distribution were comparable to those of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. In vivo, [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T showed significantly lower uptake in nontargeted tissues than [(61)Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and higher tumor uptake (14.0 +/- 5.0 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue [%IA/g]) than [(61)Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T (6.06 +/- 0.25 %IA/g, P = 0.0059), [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (10.2 +/- 1.5 %IA/g, P = 0.0972), and [(18)F]PSMA-1007 (9.70 +/- 2.57 %IA/g, P = 0.080) at 1 h after injection. Tumor uptake was also higher for [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T at 4 h after injection (10.7 +/- 3.3 %IA/g) than for [(61)Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T (4.88 +/- 0.63 %IA/g, P = 0.0014) and [(18)F]PSMA-1007 (6.28 +/- 2.19 %IA/g, P = 0.0145). Tumor-to-nontumor ratios of [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T were superior to those of [(61)Cu]Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA-I&T and comparable to those of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [(18)F]PSMA-1007 at 1 h after injection and increased significantly between 1 and 4 h after injection in most cases. Human dosimetry estimates for [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T were similar to the ones reported for (18)F-PSMA ligands. First-in-human imaging demonstrated multifocal osseous and hepatic metastases. Conclusion: [(61)Cu]Cu-NODAGA-PSMA-I&T is a promising PSMA radiotracer that compares favorably with [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [(18)F]PSMA-1007, while allowing delayed imaging."
39025375,Lysine lactylation-based insight to understanding the characterization of cervical cancer.,"Lysine lactylation (Kla), a recently discovered post-translational modification (PTM), is not only present in histone proteins but also widely distributed among non-histone proteins in tumor cells and immunocytes. However, the precise characterization and functional implications of these non-histone Kla proteins remain to be explored. Herein, a comprehensive proteomic analysis of Kla was conducted in HeLa cells. As a result, a total of 3633 Kla sites on 1637 proteins were identified. Subsequently, the stable Kla substrates were obtained and sorted to investigate the characterization and function of Kla proteins. Moreover, we characterized the Kla-related features of cervical cancers through integrative analyses of multiple datasets with proteomes, transcriptomes and single-cell transcriptome profiling. Kla-related genes (KRGs) were used to stratify cervical cancers into two clusters (C1 and C2). C2 cluster display inhibition in glycosylation and increased oxidative phosphorylation activity with high survival rate. In addition, we constructed a prognostic model based on two lactate signature genes, namely ISY1 and PPP1R14B. Interestingly, our findings revealed a negative correlation between PPP1R14B expression and the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells, as well as a lower survival rate. This observation was further validated at the single-cell resolution. Simultaneously, we found that K140R mutant of PPP1R14B resulted in the decrease of Kla level and enhanced the proliferation and migration capabilities of cervical cancer cell lines, suggesting PPP1R14B-K140la has an effect on tumor behaviors. Collectively, we provides a Kla-based insight to understanding the characterization of cervical cancer, offering a potential avenue for therapeutic approaches."
39023900,"Neoadjuvant Exercise Therapy in Prostate Cancer: A Phase 1, Decentralized Nonrandomized ControlledTrial.","IMPORTANCE: Observational data have shown that postdiagnosis exercise is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer death. The feasibility and tumor biological activity of exercise therapy is not known. OBJECTIVE: To identify recommended phase 2 dose of exercise therapy for patients with prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, phase 1a dose-finding trial was conducted at a tertiary cancer center using a patientcentric, decentralized platform and included 53 inactive men with treatment-naive localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo surgical resection between June 2019 and January 2023. Data were analyzed in June 2024. INTERVENTION: Six escalated exercise therapy dose levels ranging from 90 to 450 minutes per week of individualized, moderate-intensity treadmill walking, allocated using adaptive continual reassessment. All exercise therapy sessions were conducted remotely with real-time monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Feasibility was evaluated by relative exercise dose intensity (REDI). A dose level was considered feasible if 70% or more of patients achieved an REDI of 75% or greater. Activity end points were changes in tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) and plasma prostate-specific antigen levels between pretreatment and postintervention. Safety and changes in patient physiology were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 53 men were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 61 [56-66] years). All dose levels were feasible (>/=75% REDI). The mean (95% CI) changes in Ki67 were 5.0% (-4.3% to 14.0%) for 90 minutes per week, 2.4% (-1.3% to 6.2%) for 150 minutes per week, -1.3% (-5.8% to 3.3%) for 225 minutes per week, -0.2% (-4.0% to 3.7%) for 300 minutes per week, -2.6% (-9.2% to 4.1%) for 375 minutes per week, and 2.2% (-0.8% to 5.1%) for 450 minutes per week. Changes in prostate-specific antigen levels were 1.0 ng/mL (-1.8 to 3.8) for 90 minutes per week, 0.2 ng/mL (-1.1 to 1.5) for 150 minutes per week, -0.5 ng/mL (-1.2 to 0.3) for 225 minutes per week, -0.2 (-1.7 to 1.3) for 300 minutes per week, -0.7 ng/mL (-1.7 to 0.4) for 375 minutes per week, and -0.9 ng/mL (-2.4 to 0.7) for 450 minutes per week. No serious adverse events were observed. Overall, 225 minutes per week (approximately 45 minutes per treatment at 5 times weekly) was selected as the recommended phase 2 dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this nonrandomized clinical trial suggest that neoadjuvant exercise therapy is feasible and safe with promising activity in localized prostate cancer.

39023888,Trends and Disparities in Next-Generation Sequencing in Metastatic Prostate and Urothelial Cancers.,"IMPORTANCE: Targeted therapies based on underlying tumor genomic susceptible alterations have been approved for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC). OBJECTIVE: To assess trends and disparities in next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing among patients with mPC and aUC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used an electronic health record-derived database to extract deidentified data of patients receiving care from US physician practices, hospital-affiliated clinics, and academic practices. Patients diagnosed with mPC or aUC between March 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022, were included. EXPOSURES: Social determinants of health evaluated by race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), region, insurance type, and sex (for aUC). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were (1) NGS testing rate by year of mPC and aUC diagnosis using Clopper-Pearson 2-sided 95% CIs and (2) time to NGS testing, which considered death as a competing risk. Cumulative incidence functions were estimated for time to NGS testing. Disparities in subdistributional incidence of NGS testing were assessed by race and ethnicity, SES, region, insurance type, and sex (for aUC) using the Fine-Gray modified Cox proportional hazards model, assuming different subdistribution baseline hazards by year of mPC and aUC diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 11 927 male patients with mPC (167 Asian [1.6%], 1236 Black [11.6%], 687 Hispanic or Latino [6.4%], 7037 White [66.0%], and 1535 other [14.4%] among 10 662 with known race and ethnicity) and 6490 patients with aUC (4765 male [73.4%]; 80 Asian [1.4%], 283 Black [4.8%], 257 Hispanic or Latino [4.4%], 4376 White [74.9%], and 845 other [14.5%] among 5841 with known race and ethnicity) were eligible and included. Both cohorts had a median age of 73 years (IQR, 66-80 years), and most underwent NGS testing before first-line treatment in the mPC cohort (1502 [43.0%]) and before second-line treatment in the aUC cohort (1067 [51.3%]). In the mPC cohort, the rates of NGS testing increased from 19.0% in 2015 to 27.1% in 2022, but Black patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84) and Hispanic or Latino patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.82) were less likely to undergo NGS testing. Patients with mPC who had low SES (quintile 1: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.66-0.83]; quintile 2: HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80-0.99]), had Medicaid (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.74) or Medicare or other government insurance (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98), or lived in the West (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94) also were less likely to undergo testing. In the aUC cohort, the NGS rate increased from 14.1% in 2015 to 46.6% in 2022, but Black patients (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96) and those with low SES (quintile 1: HR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.66-0.89]; quintile 2: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76-1.00]) or Medicaid (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97) or Medicare or other government insurance (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99) were less likely to undergo NGS testing. Patients with aUC living in the South were more likely to undergo testing (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that although NGS tumor testing rates improved over time, the majority of patients still did not undergo testing. These data may help with understanding current disparities associated with NGS testing and improving access to standard-of-care health care services."
39022804,Quantitative Proteomics Reveal the Mechanism of MiR-138-5p Suppressing Cervical Cancer via Targeting ZNF385A.,"MicroRNAs are short, noncoding RNA molecules that exert pivotal roles in cancer development and progression by modulating various target genes. There is growing evidence that miR-138-5p is significantly involved in cervical cancer (CC). However, its precise molecular mechanism has yet to be fully understood. In the current investigation, a quantitative proteomics approach was utilized to detect possible miR-138-5p targets in HeLa cells systematically. In total, 364 proteins were downregulated, and 150 were upregulated after miR-138-5p overexpression. Bioinformatic analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed significant enrichment in several cancer-related pathways. Zinc finger protein 385A (ZNF385A) was determined as a novel direct target of miR-138-5p and discovered to facilitate the proliferation, migration, and cell cycle progression of HeLa cells. SFN and Fas cell surface death receptor(FAS) were then identified as functional downstream effectors of ZNF385A and miR-138-5p. Moreover, a tumor xenograft experiment was conducted to validate the association of miR-138-5p-ZNF385A-SFN/FAS axis with the development of CC in vivo. Our findings have collectively established a catalog of proteins mediated by miR-138-5p and have provided an in-depth comprehension of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effect of miR-138-5p on CC. The miR-138-5p-ZNF385A-SFN/FAS axis could also be beneficial to the identification of new therapeutic targets."
39022663,Targeting genomic receptors in voided urine for confirmation of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to validate a hypothesis that a non-invasive optical imaging assay targeting genomic VPAC receptors on malignant cells shed in voided urine will represent either benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostatic cancer (PCa). Risk for BPH in men 50-70 years old is 50-70% and PCa is 17%. BPH and PCa can coexist in 20% of men with BPH. Most commonly practiced methods to diagnose BPH do not distinguish BPH from PCa. PATIENTS OR MATERIALS AND METHODS: Males with BPH (N = 97, 60.8 +/- 6.3 years, prostate-specific antigen 0.7 +/- 0.4 ng/mL) and without oncologic disease (N = 35, 63.4 +/- 5.8 years, prostate-specific antigen < 1.5 ng/mL) signed informed consent form and provided voided urine. Urine was cytocentrifuged, cells collected on glass slide, fixed, treated with VPAC specific fluorophore TP4303 (Kd 3.1 x 10(-8)M), washed, incubated with DAPI and observed using a fluorescence microscope. Cells with no VPAC did not fluoresce (BPH) and those with VPAC had red-orange fluorescence (PCa). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses for VPAC and NKX3.1 assay for cell origin were performed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven subjects were negative for VPAC expression. Positive VPAC expression was noted in 10 subjects. Patient chart review for clinical data on these 10 VPAC positive subjects showed five had nephrolithiasis, three had renal cysts, one had prostatitis and one was being treated with finasteride. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis-VPAC expressions for 7 normal and 12 BPH subjects were 1.31 +/- 1.26 and 0.94 +/- 0.89, respectively (P = 0.46). NKX3.1 showed cells of prostate origin for finasteride-treated patient. Specificity for VPAC urine assay for excluding prostate cancer in this BPH cohort was 88.5%, positive predictive value 0.00% and negative predictive value 100%. CONCLUSION: VPAC assay may contribute extensively for BPH diagnosis and warrant continued investigation."
39021997,Comprehensive Analysis of angiogenesis associated genes and tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. This study explores the relationships between angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) and immune infiltration, and assesses their implications for the prognosis and treatment of cervical cancer. Additionally, it develops a diagnostic model based on angiogenesis-related differentially expressed genes (ARDEGs). METHODS: We systematically evaluated 15 ARDEGs using Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). Immune cell infiltration was assessed using a single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. We then constructed a diagnostic model for ARDEGs using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis and evaluated the diagnostic value of this model and the hub genes in predicting clinical outcomes and immunotherapy responses in cervical cancer. RESULTS: A set of ARDEGs was identified from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and UCSC Xena database. We performed KEGG, GO, and GSEA analyses on these genes, revealing significant involvement in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The ARDEGs diagnostic model, constructed using LASSO regression analysis, showed high predictive accuracy in cervical cancer patients. We developed a reliable nomogram and decision curve analysis to evaluate the clinical utility of the ARDEG diagnostic model. The 15 ARDEGs in the model were associated with clinicopathological features, prognosis, and immune cell infiltration. Notably, ITGA5 expression and the abundance of immune cell infiltration (specifically mast cell activation) were highly correlated. CONCLUSION: This study identifies the prognostic characteristics of ARGs in cervical cancer patients, elucidating aspects of the tumor microenvironment. It enhances the predictive accuracy of immunotherapy outcomes and establishes new strategies for immunotherapeutic interventions."
39021296,The 30th Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation Scientific Retreat Report.,"BACKGROUND: The 30th Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) Scientific Retreat was held at the Omni La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, CA, from October 26 to 28, 2023. A hybrid component was included for virtual attendees. METHODS: The Annual PCF Scientific Retreat is a leading international scientific conference focused on pioneering, unpublished, and impactful studies across the spectrum of basic through clinical prostate cancer research, as well as research from related fields with significant potential for improving prostate cancer research and patient outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS: This meeting report summarizes the presentations and discussions from the 2023 PCF Scientific Retreat. We hope that sharing this information will deepen our understanding of current and emerging research and drive future advancements in prostate cancer patient care."
39021052,PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Alterations in the PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway are commonly seen in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), however their role in outcomes is unknown. We aim to evaluate the prognostic significance as well as the genetic landscape of PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration in mCSPC. METHODS: Fourhundred and seventy-two patients with mCSPC were included who underwent next generation sequencing. PIK3/Akt/mTor pathway alterations were defined as mutations in Akt1, mTOR, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3R1, PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2. Endpoints of interests were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to development of castration resistant prostate cancer (tdCRPC), and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed and Cox regression hazard ratios (HR) were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two (31.9%) patients harbored a PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alteration. Median rPFS and tdCRPC were 23.7 and 21.0 months in PIK3/Akt/mTOR altered compared to 32.8 (p = 0.08) and 32.1 months (p = 0.002) in wildtype tumors. On multivariable analysis PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations were associated with tdCRPC (HR 1.43, 95% CI, 1.05-1.94, p = 0.02), but not rPFS [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.60, p = 0.21]. PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations were more likely to be associated with concurrent mutations in TP53 (40% vs. 28%, p = 0.01) and TMPRSS2-ERG (37% vs. 26%, p = 0.02) than tumors without PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations. Concurrent mutations were typically associated with shorter median times to rPFS and tdCRPC. DAVID analysis showed p53 signaling and angiogenesis pathways were enriched in PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway altered tumors while beta-catenin binding and altered BRCA pathway were enriched in PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway wildtype tumors. CONCLUSIONS: PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway alterations were common in mCSPC and associated with poorer prognosis. The genetic landscape of PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway altered tumors differed from wildtype tumors. Additional studies are needed to better understand and target the PIK3/Akt/mTOR pathway in mCSPC."
39020220,"Integrated analyses highlight interactions between the three-dimensional genome and DNA, RNA and epigenomic alterations in metastatic prostate cancer.","The impact of variations in the three-dimensional structure of the genome has been recognized, but solid cancer tissue studies are limited. Here, we performed integrated deep Hi-C sequencing with matched whole-genome sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) sequencing and RNA sequencing across a cohort of 80 biopsy samples from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Dramatic differences were present in gene expression, 5-methylcytosine/5hmC methylation and in structural variation versus mutation rate between A and B (open and closed) chromatin compartments. A subset of tumors exhibited depleted regional chromatin contacts at the AR locus, linked to extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) and worse response to AR signaling inhibitors. We also identified topological subtypes associated with stark differences in methylation structure, gene expression and prognosis. Our data suggested that DNA interactions may predispose to structural variant formation, exemplified by the recurrent TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. This comprehensive integrated sequencing effort represents a unique clinical tumor resource."
39019980,Clinical implications of Wnt pathway genetic alterations in men with advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant Wnt signaling has been implicated in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis in preclinical models but the impact of genetic alterations in Wnt signaling genes in men with advanced prostate cancer is unknown. METHODS: We utilized the Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine Multi-Institutional Collaborative Effort (PROMISE) clinical-genomic database for this retrospective analysis. Patients with activating mutations in CTNNB1 or RSPO2 or inactivating mutations in APC, RNF43, or ZNRF3 were defined as Wnt-altered, while those lacking such alterations were defined as Wnt non-altered. We compared patient characteristics and clinical outcomes as well as co-occurring genetic alterations according to Wnt alteration status. RESULTS: Of the 1498 patients included, 193 (12.9%) were Wnt-altered. These men had a statistically significant 2-fold increased prevalence of liver and lung metastases as compared with Wnt non-altered patients at the time of initial diagnosis, (4.66% v 2.15% ; 6.22% v 3.07%), first metastatic disease diagnosis (10.88% v 5.29%; 13.99% v 6.21%), and CRPC development (11.40% v 6.36%; 12.95% v 5.29%). Wnt alterations were associated with more co-occurring alterations in RB1 (10.4% v 6.2%), AR (38.9% vs 25.7%), SPOP (13.5% vs 4.1%), FOXA1 (6.7% vs 2.8%), and PIK3CA (10.9% vs 5.1%). We found no significant differences in overall survival or other clinical outcomes from initial diagnosis, first metastatic disease, diagnosis of CRPC, or with AR inhibition for mCRPC between the Wnt groups. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt-altered patients with prostate cancer have a higher prevalence of visceral metastases and are enriched in RB1, AR, SPOP, FOXA1, and PIK3CA alterations. Despite these associations, Wnt alterations were not associated with worse survival or treatment outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer."
39019979,Body composition as a determinant of the therapeutic index with androgen signaling inhibition.,"BACKGROUND: Androgen signaling is central to prostate cancer and men's health. Prior data indicates that increasing body fat is unfavorable in the localized setting yet associated with favorable outcomes in men with metastatic disease. Understanding the biological links between adiposity and prostate cancer may optimize the therapeutic index with ASI. We hypothesized that host adiposity and androgen synthesis are linked to the efficacy and toxicity of ASI for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: A post-hoc analysis was done of NCT02703623 where men with mCRPC (n = 186) were treated for 8 weeks with abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide (AAPA), and a satisfactory response was defined as a PSA decline >50%. Body composition was measured on baseline CT scans. Germline DNA WES was performed with a focus on variants in steroidogenic genes. Adipokine levels were measured in pre-treatment plasma. RESULTS: Germline polymorphisms in 3 genes involved in androgen synthesis (AKR1C3 rs12529, CYP17A1 rs6162, SRD5A2 rs523349) were associated with differences in body composition at baseline on ADT alone (prior to receipt of AAPA). Elevated subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATi, p = 0.02), visceral adipose tissue index (VATi, p = 0.03), and BMI (p = 0.04) were associated with satisfactory response to AAPA. Leptin had positive correlation with VATi (r = 0.47) and SATi (r = 0.48). CONCLUSION: Inherited polymorphisms in androgen synthesis correlated with differences in body composition after exposure to ADT and warrant further investigation as candidate markers for body composition toxicity. Elevated subcutaneous and visceral adiposity were associated with improved response to ASI."
39018351,Nonadditive Effects of Common Genetic Variants Have a Negligent Contribution to Cancer Heritability.,"BACKGROUND: Contribution of dominance effects to cancer heritability is unknown. We leveraged existing genome-wide association data for seven cancers to estimate the contribution of dominance effects to the heritability of individual cancer types. METHODS: We estimated the proportion of phenotypic variation caused by dominance genetic effects using genome-wide association data for seven cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin, ovarian, and prostate) in a total of 166,772 cases and 284,824 controls. RESULTS: We observed no evidence of a meaningful contribution of dominance effects to cancer heritability. By contrast, additive effects ranged between 0.11 and 0.34. CONCLUSIONS: In line with studies of other human traits, the dominance effects of common genetic variants play a minimal role in cancer etiology. IMPACT: These results support the assumption of an additive inheritance model when conducting cancer association studies with common genetic variants."
39015955,Hotspot Exon 15 Mutations in BRAF Are Uncommon in Feline Tumours.,"BRAF is one of multiple RAF proteins responsible for the activation of the MAPK cell signalling cascade involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. A hotspot BRAF(V600E) mutation, in exon 15, was determined to be a driver in 100% hairy cell leukaemias, 50%-60% of human melanomas, 30%-50% of human thyroid carcinomas and 10%-20% of human colorectal carcinomas. The orthologous BRAF(V595E) mutation was seen in 67% and 80% of canine bladder transitional cell carcinomas and prostatic adenocarcinomas, respectively. Since veterinary and human cancers exploit similar pathways and BRAF is highly conserved across species, BRAF can be expected to be a driver in a feline cancer. Primers were developed to amplify exon 15 of feline BRAF. One hundred ninety-six feline tumours were analysed. Sanger sequencing of the 211 bp PCR amplicon was done. A BRAF mutation was found in one tumour, a cutaneous melanoma. The mutation was a BRAF(V597E) mutation, orthologous to the canine and human hotspot mutations. A common synonymous variant, BRAF(T586T), was seen in 23% (47/196) of tumours. This variant was suspected to be a single nucleotide polymorphism. BRAF was not frequently mutated in common feline tumours or in tumour types that frequently harbour BRAF mutations in human and canine cancers. As is seen in canine cancer genomics, the mutational profile in feline tumours may not parallel the histologic equivalent in human oncology."

39014225,GPC2 promotes prostate cancer progression via MDK-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,"Prostate cancer is a major medical problem for men worldwide. Advanced prostate cancer is currently incurable. Recently, much attention was paid to the role of GPC2 in the field of oncology. Nevertheless, there have been no investigations of GPC2 and its regulatory mechanism in prostate cancer. Here, we revealed a novel action of GPC2 and a tumor promoting mechanism in prostate cancer. GPC2 was upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Higher expression of GPC2 was correlated with higher Gleason score, lymphatic metastasis, and worse overall survival in prostate cancer patients. Decreased expression of GPC2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in prostate cancer, whereas GPC2 overexpression promoted these properties. Mechanistically, GPC2 promoted the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through MDK. The rescue assay results in prostate cancer cells demonstrated that overexpression of MDK could attenuate GPC2 knockdown induced inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling and partly reverse GPC2 knockdown induced inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In all, our study identified GPC2 as an oncogene in prostate cancer. GPC2 promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via MDK-mediated activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. GPC2 might be a promising prognosis predictor and potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer."
39014148,Cellular heterogeneity and key subsets of tissue-resident memory T cells in cervical cancer.,"Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) play a critical role in cancer immunity by offering quick and effective immune responses. However, the cellular heterogeneity of TRMs and their significance in cervical cancer (CC) remain unknown. In this study, we generated and analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from 12,945 TRMs (ITGAE(+) CD3D(+)) and 25,627 non-TRMs (ITGAE(-) CD3D(+)), derived from 11 CC tissues and 5 normal cervical tissues. We found that TRMs were more immunoreactive than non-TRMs, and TRMs in CC tissues were more activated than those in normal cervical tissues. Six CD8(+) TRM subclusters and one CD4(+) TRM subcluster were identified. Among them, CXCL13(+) CD8(+) TRMs were more abundant in CC tissues than in normal cervical tissues, had both cytotoxic and inhibitory features, and were enriched in pathways related to defense responses to the virus. Meanwhile, PLAC8(+) CD8(+) TRMs were less abundant in CC tissues than in normal cervical tissues but had highly cytotoxic features. The signature gene set scores of both cell subclusters were positively correlated with the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients with CC following radiotherapy. Of note, the association between HLA-E and NKG2A, either alone or in a complex with CD94, was enriched in CXCL13(+) CD8(+) TRMs interacting with epithelial cells at CC tissues. The in-depth characterization of TRMs heterogeneity in the microenvironment of CC could have important implications for advancing treatment and improving the prognosis of patients with CC."
39013135,Transcriptomic Profiling of Primary Prostate Cancers and Nonlocalized Disease on Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"PURPOSE: To characterize the relationship between Decipher genomic classifier scores and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-based metastatic spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients from four institutions who underwent PSMA PET/CT scans pretreatment for primary staging or postradical prostatectomy (RP) for suspected recurrence and had Decipher transcriptomic data available from biopsy or RP specimens. PSMA PET/CT-based patterns of spread were classified as localized (miT + N0M0) or nonlocalized (miN1M0 or miM1a-c). We calculated the association between Decipher scores and the risk of nonlocalized disease on PSMA PET/CT using multivariable logistic regression for pretreatment patients and multivariable Cox regression for post-RP patients. We also compared select transcriptomic signatures between patients with localized and nonlocalized diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-six patients were included (pretreatment: n = 329; post-RP: n = 257). Higher Decipher scores were associated with nonlocalized disease on PSMA PET/CT both pretreatment (odds ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.36] per 0.1 increase in Decipher score, P = .02) and post-RP (hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.27] per 0.1 increase in Decipher score, P = .003). In the pretreatment setting, nonlocalized disease was associated with higher rates of TP53 mutations and lower rates of PAM50 luminal A subtype compared with localized disease. In the post-RP setting, overexpression of signatures related to metabolism, DNA repair, and androgen receptor signaling were associated with higher rates of nonlocalized disease. CONCLUSION: Higher Decipher scores were associated with nonlocalized disease identified on PSMA PET/CT both pretreatment and post-RP. There were several transcriptomic differences between localized and nonlocalized diseases in both settings."
39011875,Prevalence of homologous recombination biomarkers in multiple tumor types: an observational study.,"Aim: To determine the prevalence of deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and in 13 genes involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR), the prevalence of genomic loss of heterozygosity and the allelic and hereditary status of BRCA1, BRCA2 and other HRR gene mutations in multiple solid tumor types.Patients & methods: This was a retrospective observational study of patients with an advanced/metastatic diagnosis in one of 15 solid tumor types, who were identified in a real-world clinico-genomic database.Results: Tumor tissue samples from 9457 patients were analyzed, among which 4.7% had known or suspected deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations. The prevalence (range) of mutations in HRR genes was 13.6% (2.4%-26.0%) and genomic loss of heterozygosity >/=16% was 20.6% (2.6-34.4%) across all tumor types.Conclusion: The prevalence of mutations varied significantly depending on the type of tumor."
39011643,Plasma proteometabolome in lung cancer: exploring biomarkers through bidirectional Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis.,"Unlike other cancers with widespread screening (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate, and skin), lung nodule biopsies for positive screenings have higher morbidity with clinical complications. Development of non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers could thereby significantly enhance lung cancer management for at-risk patients. Here, we leverage Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate the plasma proteome and metabolome for potential biomarkers relevant to lung cancer. Utilizing bidirectional MR and co-localization analyses, we identify novel associations, highlighting inverse relationships between plasma proteins SFTPB and KDELC2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and positive associations of TCL1A with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and CNTN1 with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Additionally, our work reveals significant negative correlations between metabolites such as theobromine and paraxanthine, along with paraxanthine-related ratios, in both LUAD and LUSC. Conversely, positive correlations are found in caffeine/paraxanthine and arachidonate (20:4n6)/paraxanthine ratios with these cancer types. Through single-cell sequencing data of normal lung tissue, we further explore the role of lung tissue-specific protein SFTPB in carcinogenesis. These findings offer new insights into lung cancer etiology, potentially guiding the development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches."
39011400,Causality of genetically determined metabolites on susceptibility to prevalent urological cancers: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Prevalent urological cancers, including kidney, prostate, bladder, and testicular cancers, contribute significantly to global cancer incidence and mortality. Metabolomics, focusing on small-molecule intermediates, has emerged as a tool to understand cancer etiology. Given the knowledge gap in this field, we employ a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites (GDMs) and the susceptibility to four common urological cancers. METHODS: The study employs genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from European populations, featuring the most extensive case count available for both blood metabolites and four prevalent urological cancers. Preliminary and secondary MR analyses were separately conducted, employing inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method. Multiple statistical analyses, including the MR-Steiger test, Cochran's Q test, leave-one-out analysis, MR-Egger intercept analysis, and MR-PRESSO analysis, were executed to ensure robustness. Additionally, a meta-analysis was carried out to consolidate findings. The weighted median (WM) method was utilized for a relatively lenient correction (P(WM) < 0.05). RESULTS: After rigorous genetic variation filtering, 645 out of 1,400 metabolites were included in both preliminary and secondary MR analyses. Preliminary MR analysis identified 96 potential causal associations between 94 distinct metabolites and four urological cancers. Secondary analysis based on Finnish outcome data revealed 93 potential causal associations. Cross-database meta-analysis identified 68 blood metabolites associated with four urological cancers. Notably, 31 metabolites remained significant after using WM for correction, with additional 37 suggestive causal relationships. Reverse MR analysis revealed a significant causal association between genetically predicted prostate cancer and elevated 4-hydroxychlorothalonil levels (IVW, combined OR: 1.039, 95% CI 1.014-1.064, p = 0.002; WM, combined OR: 1.052, 95% CI 1.010-1.095, p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive MR study provides insights into the causal relationships between blood metabolites and urological cancers, revealing potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, thereby addressing gaps in understanding and laying the foundation for targeted interventions in urological cancer research and treatment."
39010058,Co-expression in tissue-specific gene networks links genes in cancer-susceptibility loci to known somatic driver genes.,"BACKGROUND: The genetic background of cancer remains complex and challenging to integrate. Many somatic mutations within genes are known to cause and drive cancer, while genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cancer have revealed many germline risk factors associated with cancer. However, the overlap between known somatic driver genes and positional candidate genes from GWAS loci is surprisingly small. We hypothesised that genes from multiple independent cancer GWAS loci should show tissue-specific co-regulation patterns that converge on cancer-specific driver genes. RESULTS: We studied recent well-powered GWAS of breast, prostate, colorectal and skin cancer by estimating co-expression between genes and subsequently prioritising genes that show significant co-expression with genes mapping within susceptibility loci from cancer GWAS. We observed that the prioritised genes were strongly enriched for cancer drivers defined by COSMIC, IntOGen and Dietlein et al. The enrichment of known cancer driver genes was most significant when using co-expression networks derived from non-cancer samples of the relevant tissue of origin. CONCLUSION: We show how genes within risk loci identified by cancer GWAS can be linked to known cancer driver genes through tissue-specific co-expression networks. This provides an important explanation for why seemingly unrelated sets of genes that harbour either germline risk factors or somatic mutations can eventually cause the same type of disease."

39005932,"Phytochemical analysis, in-vitro and in-silico study of antiproliferative activity of ethyl acetate fraction of Launaea cornuta (Hochst. ex Oliv. & Hiern) C. Jeffrey against human cervical cancer cell line.","Introduction: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women globally due to the limitation of current treatment methods and their associated adverse side effects. Launaea cornuta is used as traditional medicine for the treatment of a variety of diseases including cancer. However, there is no scientific validation on the antiproliferative activity of L. cornuta against cervical cancer. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the selective antiproliferative, cytotoxic and antimigratory effects of L. cornuta and to explore its therapeutical mechanisms in human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa-229) through a network analysis approach. Materials and methods: The cytotoxic effect of L. cornuta ethyl acetate fraction on the proliferation of cervical cancer cells was evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) bioassay and the antimigratory effect was assessed by wound healing assays. Compounds were analysed using the qualitative colour method and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Subsequently, bioinformatic analyses, including the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, were performed to screen for potential anticervical cancer therapeutic target genes of L. cornuta. Molecular docking (MD) was performed to predict and understand the molecular interactions of the ligands against cervical cancer. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the network analysis results. Results: L. cornuta ethyl acetate fraction exhibited a remarkable cytotoxic effect on HeLa-229 proliferation (IC(50) of 20.56 +/- 2.83 mug/mL) with a selectivity index (SI) of 2.36 with minimal cytotoxicity on non-cancerous cells (Vero-CCL 81 (IC(50) of 48.83 +/- 23.02). The preliminary screening revealed the presence of glycosides, phenols, saponins, terpenoids, quinones, and tannins. Thirteen compounds were also identified by GC-MS analysis. 124 potential target genes associated with the effect of L. cornuta ethyl acetate fraction on human cervical cancer were obtained, including AKT1, MDM2, CDK2, MCL1 and MTOR were identified among the top hub genes and PI3K/Akt1, Ras/MAPK, FoxO and EGFR signalling pathways were identified as the significantly enriched pathways. Molecular docking results showed that stigmasteryl methyl ether had a good binding affinity against CDK2, ATK1, BCL2, MDM2, and Casp9, with binding energy ranging from -7.0 to -12.6 kcal/mol. Tremulone showed a good binding affinity against TP53 and P21 with -7.0 and -8.0 kcal/mol, respectively. This suggests a stable molecular interaction of the ethyl acetate fraction of L. cornuta compounds with the selected target genes for cervical cancer. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that CDK2, MDM2 and BCL2 were downregulated, and Casp9 and P21 were upregulated in HeLa-229 cells treated with L. cornuta compared to the negative control (DMSO 0.2%). Conclusion: The findings indicate that L. cornuta ethyl acetate fraction phytochemicals modulates various molecular targets and pathways to exhibit selective antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects against HeLa-229 cells. This study lays a foundation for further research to develop innovative clinical anticervical cancer agents."
39005348,"Pan-cancer subclonal mutation analysis of 7,827 tumors predicts clinical outcome.","Intra-tumor heterogeneity is an important driver of tumor evolution and therapy response. Advances in precision cancer treatment will require understanding of mutation clonality and subclonal architecture. Currently the slow computational speed of subclonal reconstruction hinders large cohort studies. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed Clonal structure identification through Pairwise Penalization, or CliPP, which clusters subclonal mutations using a regularized likelihood model. CliPP reliably processed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from over 12,000 tumor samples within 24 hours, thus enabling large-scale downstream association analyses between subclonal structures and clinical outcomes. Through a pan-cancer investigation of 7,827 tumors from 32 cancer types, we found that high subclonal mutational load (sML), a measure of latency time in tumor evolution, was significantly associated with better patient outcomes in 16 cancer types with low to moderate tumor mutation burden (TMB). In a cohort of prostate cancer patients participating in an immunotherapy clinical trial, high sML was indicative of favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade. This comprehensive study using CliPP underscores sML as a key feature of cancer. sML may be essential for linking mutation dynamics with immunotherapy response in the large population of non-high TMB cancers."

39001941,Targeting DNA Damage Response Deficiency in Thoracic Cancers.,"Thoracic cancers comprise non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM). Collectively, they account for the highest rate of death from malignancy worldwide. Genomic instability is a universal feature of cancer, which fuels mutations and tumour evolution. Deficiencies in DNA damage response (DDR) genes amplify genomic instability. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), resulting from BRCA1/BRCA2 inactivation, is exploited for therapeutic synthetic lethality with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in breast and ovarian cancers, as well as in prostate and pancreatic cancers. However, DDR deficiency and its therapeutic implications are less well established in thoracic cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of thoracic cancers may harbour DDR deficiency and may, thus, be effectively targeted with DDR agents. Here, we review the current evidence surrounding DDR in thoracic cancers and discuss the challenges and promise for achieving clinical benefit with such therapeutics."
39001544,Germline Sequencing of DNA Damage Repair Genes in Two Hereditary Prostate Cancer Cohorts Reveals New Disease Risk-Associated Gene Variants.,"Rare, inherited variants in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes have a recognised role in prostate cancer (PrCa) susceptibility. In addition, these genes are therapeutically targetable. While rare variants are informing clinical management in other common cancers, defining the rare disease-associated variants in PrCa has been challenging. Here, whole-genome and -exome sequencing data from two independent, high-risk Australian and North American familial PrCa datasets were interrogated for novel DDR risk variants. Rare DDR gene variants (predicted to be damaging and present in two or more family members) were identified and subsequently genotyped in 1963 individuals (700 familial and 459 sporadic PrCa cases, 482 unaffected relatives, and 322 screened controls), and association analyses accounting for relatedness (M(QLS)) undertaken. In the combined datasets, rare ERCC3 (rs145201970, p = 2.57 x 10(-4)) and BRIP1 (rs4988345, p = 0.025) variants were significantly associated with PrCa risk. A PARP2 (rs200603922, p = 0.028) variant in the Australian dataset and a MUTYH (rs36053993, p = 0.031) variant in the North American dataset were also associated with risk. Evaluation of clinicopathological characteristics provided no evidence for a younger age or higher-grade disease at diagnosis in variant carriers, which should be taken into consideration when determining genetic screening eligibility criteria for targeted, gene-based treatments in the future. This study adds valuable knowledge to our understanding of PrCa-associated DDR genes, which will underpin effective clinical screening and treatment strategies."
39001386,Online Provision of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Health Information: A Search Engine Driven Systematic Web-Based Analysis.,"BRCA genetic testing is available for UK Jewish individuals but the provision of information online for BRCA is unknown. We aimed to evaluate online provision of BRCA information by UK organisations (UKO), UK Jewish community organisations (JCO), and genetic testing providers (GTP). Google searches for organisations offering BRCA information were performed using relevant sets of keywords. The first 100 website links were categorised into UKOs/JCOs/GTPs; additional JCOs were supplemented through community experts. Websites were reviewed using customised questionnaires for BRCA information. Information provision was assessed for five domains: accessibility, scope, depth, accuracy, and quality. These domains were combined to provide a composite score (maximum score = 5). Results were screened (n = 6856) and 45 UKOs, 16 JCOs, and 18 GTPs provided BRCA information. Accessibility was high (84%,66/79). Scope was lacking with 35% (28/79) addressing >50% items. Most (82%, 65/79) described BRCA-associated cancers: breast and/or ovarian cancer was mentioned by 78%(62/79), but only 34% (27/79) mentioned >/=1 pancreatic, prostate, melanoma. Few websites provided carrier frequencies in the general (24%,19/79) and Jewish populations (20%,16/79). Only 15% (12/79) had quality information with some/minimal shortcomings. Overall information provision was low-to-moderate: median scores UKO = 2.1 (IQR = 1), JCO = 1.6 (IQR = 0.9), and GTP = 2.3 (IQR = 1) (maximum-score = 5). There is a scarcity of high-quality BRCA information online. These findings have implications for UK Jewish BRCA programmes and those considering BRCA testing."
39000397,The Prognostic and Therapeutic Potential of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) Gene Expression in Prostate Adenocarcinoma: Insights into Survival Outcomes and Oncogenic Pathway Modulation.,"Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is the second most common tumor associated with death. The role and mechanisms of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene in PRAD remain unknown. We conducted an analysis of FMR1 expression in PRAD to determine its prognostic importance and connection to carcinogenic pathways such as PI3K_AKT_mTOR. Survival analyses were utilized to establish a correlation between FMR1 expression and patient outcomes. We used the integration of genomic data with bioinformatic predictions to predict the regulatory factors of the FMR1 gene in PRAD. Our data revealed that individuals with higher levels of FMR1 expression experience worse survival outcomes compared to those with lower expression (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 - 24, p = 0.0412). FMR1 expression was significantly higher in patients with advanced pathological tumor stages, particularly in the pT3 and pT4 combined stages and the pN1 nodal stage. Furthermore, patients with high Gleason scores (GSs) (combined GSs 8 and 9) exhibited increased levels of FMR1 expression. Our results further identify a possible regulatory link between FMR1 and key oncogenic pathways, including PI3K_AKT_mTOR, and predict the possible mechanism by which FMR1 is regulated in PRAD. Our data suggest that the FMR1 gene could serve as a biomarker for PRAD progression. However, in-depth investigations, including those with large patient samples and in vitro studies, are needed to validate this finding and understand the mechanisms involved."
39000020,"Purine-Rich Element Binding Protein Alpha, a Nuclear Matrix Protein, Has a Role in Prostate Cancer Progression.","Solid tumors as well as leukemias and lymphomas show striking changes in nuclear structure including nuclear size and shape, the number and size of nucleoli, and chromatin texture. These alterations have been used in cancer diagnosis and might be related to the altered functional properties of cancer cells. The nuclear matrix (NM) represents the structural composition of the nucleus and consists of nuclear lamins and pore complexes, an internal ribonucleic protein network, and residual nucleoli. In the nuclear microenvironment, the NM is associated with multi-protein complexes, such as basal transcription factors, signaling proteins, histone-modifying factors, and chromatin remodeling machinery directly or indirectly through scaffolding proteins. Therefore, alterations in the composition of NM could result in altered DNA topology and changes in the interaction of various genes, which could then participate in a cascade of the cancer process. Using an androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, and its androgen-independent derivative, LN96, conventional 2D-proteomic analysis of the NM proteins revealed that purine-rich element binding protein alpha (PURalpha) was detected in the NM proteins and differentially expressed between the cell lines. In this article, we will review the potential role of the molecule in prostate cancer."
38997745,Does metformin really reduce prostate cancer risk: an up-to-date comprehensive genome-wide analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between metformin use and prostate cancer (PCa) risk has yet to be clear despite more than a decade of debate on this topic. Hence, we aimed to investigate the causal role of metformin in reducing PCa risk through an up-to-date comprehensive genome-wide analysis. METHODS: We employed validated instrument variables of metformin use derived from a prior high-quality study, including five potential targets (AMPK, GCG, GDF15, MCI and MG3). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to harmonize genetically predicted metformin use and PCa phenotypes. PCa phenotypes were from two large genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) and the FinnGen cohort. Seven methods were applied to generate MR results: the inverse variance weighted (IVW), IVW with multiplicative random effects, MR-Egger, MR-Egger (bootstrap), weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode. Strict sensitivity analysis was conducted to satisfy core assumptions of MR design. RESULTS: We enrolled 32 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that involved with metformin use. Nearly all targets yielded insignificant primary results (IVW with multiplicative random effects), except that AMPK target posed a positive effect on PCa risk from FinnGen cohort [odds ratio (OR): 6.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-33.53, P value: 0.038]. The general effect of metformin use, comprising all 5 targets, also yielded negative results (random-effect meta-analysis with OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.76-1.58, P value: 0.637 for PRACTICAL; OR: 2.55, 95% CI: 0.58-11.16, P value: 0.215 for FinnGen). None of the sensitivity analyses provided support for a causal association between metformin use and PCa risk. CONCLUSION: This up-to-date study did not support the protective role of metformin in reducing PCa risk, considering each target, overall effect, and sensitivity analysis. It is imperative to reflect on the presumed ""almighty medicine"" and ongoing phase III trials are anticipated to assess the anti-neoplasm effect of metformin."
38997466,Tumor evolution metrics predict recurrence beyond 10 years in locally advanced prostate cancer.,"Cancer evolution lays the groundwork for predictive oncology. Testing evolutionary metrics requires quantitative measurements in controlled clinical trials. We mapped genomic intratumor heterogeneity in locally advanced prostate cancer using 642 samples from 114 individuals enrolled in clinical trials with a 12-year median follow-up. We concomitantly assessed morphological heterogeneity using deep learning in 1,923 histological sections from 250 individuals. Genetic and morphological (Gleason) diversity were independent predictors of recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.12 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.34-7.3; HR = 2.24 and 95% CI = 1.28-3.92). Combined, they identified a group with half the median time to recurrence. Spatial segregation of clones was also an independent marker of recurrence (HR = 2.3 and 95% CI = 1.11-4.8). We identified copy number changes associated with Gleason grade and found that chromosome 6p loss correlated with reduced immune infiltration. Matched profiling of relapse, decades after diagnosis, confirmed that genomic instability is a driving force in prostate cancer progression. This study shows that combining genomics with artificial intelligence-aided histopathology leads to the identification of clinical biomarkers of evolution."
38996041,Breast Cancer is Increased in Women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency.,"CONTEXT: DNA damage/repair gene variants are associated with both primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and cancer risk. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a subset of women with POI and family members would have increased risk for cancer. DESIGN: Case-control population-based study using records from 1995-2022. SETTING: Two major Utah academic healthcare systems serving 85% of the state. SUBJECTS: Women with POI (n=613) were identified using ICD codes and reviewed for accuracy. Relatives were linked using the Utah Population Database. INTERVENTION: Cancer diagnoses were identified using the Utah Cancer Registry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relative risk of cancer in women with POI and relatives was estimated by comparison to population rates. Whole genome sequencing was performed on a subset of women. RESULTS: Breast cancer was increased in women with POI (OR [95%CI] 2.20 [1.30, 3.47]; p=0.0023) and there was a nominally significant increase in ovarian cancer. Probands with POI were 36.5+/-4.3 years and 59.5+/-12.7 years when diagnosed with POI and cancer, respectively. Causal and candidate gene variants for cancer and POI were identified.Among second-degree relatives of these women, there was an increased risk of breast (1.28 [1.08, 1.52]; p=0.0078) and colon cancer (1.50 [1.14, 1.94]; p=0.0036). Prostate cancer was increased in first- (1.64 [1.18, 2.23]; p=0.0026), second- (1.54 [1.32, 1.79]; p<0.001), and third-degree relatives (1.33 [1.20, 1.48]; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest common genetic risk for POI and reproductive cancers. Tools are needed to predict cancer risk in women with POI and potentially to counsel about risks of hormone replacement therapy."
38993562,PiRNA-4447944 promotes castration-resistant growth and metastasis of prostate cancer by inhibiting NEFH expression through forming the piRNA-4447944-PIWIL2-NEFH complex.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the leading cause of prostate cancer (PCa)-related death in males, which occurs after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are crucial regulators in many human cancers, but their expression patterns and roles in CRPC remain unknown. In this study, we performed small RNA sequencing to explore CRPC-associated piRNAs using 10 benign prostate tissues, and 9 paired hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPCa) and CRPC tissues from the same patients. PiRNA-4447944 (piR-4447944) was discovered to be highly expressed in CRPC group compared with HSPCa and benign groups. Functional analyses revealed that piR-4447944 overexpression endowed PCa cells with castration resistance ability in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of piR-4447944 using anti-sense RNA suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRPC cells. Additionally, enforced piR-4447944 expression promoted in vitro migration and invasion of PCa cells, and reduced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, piR-4447944 bound to PIWIL2 to form a piR-4447944/PIWIL2 complex and inhibited tumor suppressor NEFH through direct interaction at the post-transcriptional level. Collectively, our study indicates that piR-4447944 is essential for prostate tumor-propagating cells and mediates androgen-independent growth of PCa, which extends current understanding of piRNAs in cancer biology and provides a potential approach for CRPC treatment."

38992170,A genetic variant in the TAPBP gene enhances cervical cancer susceptibility by increasing m(6)A modification.,"Genetic variants can affect gene expression by altering the level of N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications. A better understanding of the association of these genetic variants with susceptibility to cervical cancer (CC) can promote advances in disease screening and treatment. Genome-wide identification of m(6)A-associated functional SNPs for CC was performed using the TCGA and JENGER databases, incorporating the data from RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq. The screened risk-associated SNP rs1059288 (A>G), which is located in the 3' UTR of TAPBP, was further validated in a case-control study involving 921 cases and 1077 controls. The results revealed a significant association between rs1059288 and the risk of CC (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13-1.92). Mechanistically, the presence of the risk G allele of rs1059288 was associated with increased m(6)A modification of TAPBP compared with the A allele. This modification was facilitated by the m(6)A methyltransferase METTL14 and the reading protein YTHDF2. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays containing 61 CC and 45 normal tissues showed an overexpression of TAPBP in CC. Furthermore, the upregulation of TAPBP promoted the growth and migration of CC cells as well as tumor-forming ability, inhibited apoptosis, and conferred increased resistance to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as bleomycin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. Knockdown of TAPBP inhibited the JAK/STAT/MICB signaling pathway in CC cells and upregulated certain immune genes including ISG15, IRF3, PTPN6, and HLA-A. These findings offer insights into the involvement of genetic variations in TAPBP in the development and progression of CC."
38991018,A Zwitterionic Detergent and Catalyst-Based Single-Cell Proteomics Using a Loss-Free Microhole-Collection Disc.,"Recent advances in single-cell proteomics have solved many bottlenecks, such as throughput, sample recovery, and scalability via nanoscale sample handling. In this study, we aimed for a sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) analysis capable of handling single cells with a conventional mass spectrometry workflow without additional equipment. We achieved seamless cell lysis and TMT labeling in a micro-HOLe Disc (microHOLD) by developing a mass-compatible single solution based on a zwitterionic detergent and a catalyst for single-cell lysis and tandem mass tag labeling without a heat incubation step. This method was developed to avoid peptide loss by surface adsorption and buffer or tube changes by collecting tandem mass tag-labeled peptide through microholes placed in the liquid chromatography injection vials in a single solution. We successfully applied the microHOLD single-cell proteomics method for the analysis of proteome reprogramming in hormone-sensitive prostate cells to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. This novel single-cell proteomics method is not limited by cutting-edge nanovolume handling equipment and achieves high throughput and ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of limited samples, such as single cells."
38990856,Seroepidemiological assessment of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among 25 and 28 year-old adult women in Finland between March 2020-June 2022.,"INTRODUCTION: Serological surveys of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 are instrumental to understanding the course of the COVID-19 epidemic. We evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among young adult Finnish females residing in 25 communities all over Finland from 2020 until 2022. METHODS: Between 1st March 2020 and 30th June 2022, 3589 blood samples were collected from 3583 women born in 1992-95 when aged 25 or 28 years old attending the follow-up of an ongoing population-based trial of cervical screening strategies. The crude and population standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was measured using nucleocapsid (induced by infection) and spike wild-type (WT) protein (induced both by infection and by vaccination) antigens over time and stratified by place of residence (inside or outside the Helsinki metropolitan region). RESULTS: During 2020 (before vaccinations), spike-WT and nucleocapsid IgG antibodies followed each other closely, at very low levels (<5%). Spike-WT seropositivity increased rapidly concomitant with mass vaccinations in 2021 and reached 96.3% in the 2nd quartile of 2022. Antibodies to nucleocapsid IgG remained relatively infrequent throughput 2020-2021, increasing rapidly in the 1st and 2nd quartiles of 2022 (to 19.7% and 56.6% respectively). The nucleocapsid IgG seropositivity increased more profoundly in participants residing in the Helsinki metropolitan region (4.5%, 8.4% and 43.9% in 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively) compared to those residing in communities outside the capital region (4.5%, 4.3% and 34.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Low SARS-CoV-2 infection-related seroprevalence during 2020-2021 suggest a comparatively successful infection control. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 WT spike protein became extremely common among young women by the end of 2021, in line with the high uptake of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Finally, the rapid increase of seroprevalences to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein during the first and second quartile of 2022, imply a high incidence of infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants able to escape vaccine-induced protection."
38990734,An Atlas of Accessible Chromatin in Advanced Prostate Cancer Reveals the Epigenetic Evolution during Tumor Progression.,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a lethal disease that resists therapy targeting androgen signaling, the primary driver of prostate cancer. mCRPC resists androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors by amplifying AR signaling or by evolving into therapy-resistant subtypes that do not depend on AR. Elucidation of the epigenetic underpinnings of these subtypes could provide important insights into the drivers of therapy resistance. In this study, we produced chromatin accessibility maps linked to the binding of lineage-specific transcription factors (TF) by performing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing on 70 mCRPC tissue biopsies integrated with transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing. mCRPC had a distinct global chromatin accessibility profile linked to AR function. Analysis of TF occupancy across accessible chromatin revealed 203 TFs associated with mCRPC subtypes. Notably, ZNF263 was identified as a putative prostate cancer TF with a significant impact on gene activity in the double-negative subtype (AR- neuroendocrine-), potentially activating MYC targets. Overall, this analysis of chromatin accessibility in mCRPC provides valuable insights into epigenetic changes that occur during progression to mCRPC. Significance: Integration of a large cohort of transcriptome, whole-genome, and ATAC sequencing characterizes the chromatin accessibility changes in advanced prostate cancer and identifies therapy-resistant prostate cancer subtype-specific transcription factors that modulate oncogenic programs."
38990246,"Feasibility study of ADCs targeting TROP-2, HER2, and CD46 in Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Intraductal Carcinoma of the prostate.","BACKGROUND: Ductal Adenocarcinoma (DAC) and Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate (IDC-P) respond poorly to all the currently available conventional therapies. Given their accurate and efficient elimination of cancer cells, Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have become one of the most promising anticancer treatments. However, no ADCs have so far been approved for Prostate Cancer (PCa) treatment. This study investigated TROP-2, HER2, and CD46 expression in DAC/IDC-P samples, indirectly analyzing their preliminary feasibility as therapeutic targets for future treatment of the two conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving 184 participants (87 DAC/IDC-P patients and 97 Prostatic Acinar Adenocarcinoma (PAC) patients with a Gleason score >/= 8) without prior treatment between August 2017 and August 2022. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to detect the differential protein expressions of TROP-2, HER2, and CD46 in DAC/IDC-P, PAC, and normal prostate tissues. RESULTS: Compared to pure PAC tissues, TROP-2 expression was significantly higher in DAC/IDC-P and DAC/IDC-P-adjacent PAC tissues (H-score 68.8 vs. 43.8, p < 0.001, and 59.8 vs. 43.8, p = 0.022, respectively). No significant differences in HER2 expression were observed across different cancer tissues. Compared to both DAC/IDC-P-adjacent PAC and pure PAC tissues, CD46 expression was significantly higher in DAC/IDC-P tissues (42.3 vs. 28.6, p = 0.041, and 42.3 vs. 24.3, p = 0.0035, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Herein, TROP-2 and CD46 expression was higher in DAC/IDC-P tissues than in pure PAC and normal prostate tissues. This finding implies that ADCs targeting the two proteins hold significant promise as potential future treatments for DAC/IDC-P."

38988817,Ultrasensitive detection of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in genomic DNA using a graphene-based sensor modified with biotin and gold nanoparticles.,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins orchestrate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation-demethylation dynamics by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and are frequently inactivated in various cancers. Due to the significance of 5hmC as an epigenetic biomarker for cancer diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment, its rapid and precise quantification is essential. Here, we report a highly sensitive electrochemical method for quantifying genomic 5hmC using graphene sheets that were electrochemically exfoliated and functionalized with biotin and gold nanoparticles (Bt-AuNPs) through a single-step electrical method. The attachment of Bt-AuNPs to graphene enhances the specificity of 5hmC-containing DNA and augments the oxidation of 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine in DNA. When coupled to a gold electrode, the Bt-AuNP-graphene-based sensor exhibits exceptional sensitivity and specificity for detecting 5hmC, with a detection limit of 63.2 fM. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable capacity to measure 5hmC levels across a range of biological samples, including preclinical mouse tissues with varying 5hmC levels due to either TET gene disruption or oncogenic transformation, as well as human prostate cancer cell lines. Therefore, our sensing strategy has substantial potential for cancer diagnostics and prognosis."
38988627,Characteristics of the immune environment in prostate cancer as an adjunct to immunotherapy.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts an important role in carcinogenesis and progression. Several investigations have suggested that immune cell infiltration (ICI) is of high prognostic importance for tumor progression and patient survival in many tumors, particularly prostate cancer. The pattern of immune infiltration of PCa, on the other hand, has not been thoroughly understood. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets on PCa were obtained, and several datasets were merged into one data set using the ""ComBat"" algorithm. The ICI profiles of PCa patients were then to be uncovered by two computer techniques. The unsupervised clustering method was utilized to identify three ICI patterns in tumor samples, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to estimate the ICI score. RESULTS: Three different clusters of three ICIs were identified in 1341 PCa samples, which also correlated with different clinical features/characteristics and biological pathways. Patients with PCa are classified into high and low subtypes based on the ICI scores extracted from immune-associated signature genes. High ICI score subtypes are associated with a worse prognosis, which may intrigue the activation of cancer-related and immune-related pathways such as pathways involving Toll-like receptors, T-cell receptors, JAK-STAT, and natural killer cells. The ICI score was linked to tumor mutation load and immune/cancer-relevant signaling pathways, which explain prostate cancer's poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study not only advanced our knowledge of the mechanism of immune response in the prostate tumor microenvironment but also provided a novel biomarker, that is, the ICI score, for disease prognosis and guiding precision immunotherapy."
38988485,Clinical and molecular significance of homologous recombination deficiency positive non-small cell lung cancer in Chinese population: An integrated genomic and transcriptional analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical significance of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer has been established, but the value of HRD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been fully investigated. This study aimed to systematically analyze the HRD status of untreated NSCLC and its relationship with patient prognosis to further guide clinical care. METHODS: A total of 355 treatment-naive NSCLC patients were retrospectively enrolled. HRD status was assessed using the AmoyDx Genomic Scar Score (GSS), with a score of >/=50 considered HRD-positive. Genomic, transcriptomic, tumor microenvironmental characteristics and prognosis between HRD-positive and HRD-negative patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the patients, 25.1% (89/355) were HRD-positive. Compared to HRD-negative patients, HRD-positive patients had more somatic pathogenic homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations, higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) (P<0.001), and fewer driver gene mutations (P<0.001). Furthermore, HRD-positive NSCLC had more amplifications in PI3K pathway and cell cycle genes, MET and MYC in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutant NSCLC, and more PIK3CA and AURKA in EGFR/ALK wild-type NSCLC. HRD-positive NSCLC displayed higher tumor proliferation and immunosuppression activity. HRD-negative NSCLC showed activated signatures of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, interferon (IFN)-gamma and effector memory CD8+ T cells. HRD-positive patients had a worse prognosis and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) to targeted therapy (first- and third-generation EGFR-TKIs) (P=0.042). Additionally, HRD-positive, EGFR/ALK wild-type patients showed a numerically lower response to platinum-free immunotherapy regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Unique genomic and transcriptional characteristics were found in HRD-positive NSCLC. Poor prognosis and poor response to EGFR-TKIs and immunotherapy were observed in HRD-positive NSCLC. This study highlights potential actionable alterations in HRD-positive NSCLC, suggesting possible combinational therapeutic strategies for these patients."
38988108,Identifying Comprehensive Genomic Alterations and Potential Neoantigens for Cervical Cancer Immunotherapy in a Cohort of Chinese Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Cervix.,"OBJECTIVE: Genomic alterations and potential neoantigens for cervical cancer immunotherapy were identified in a cohort of Chinese patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify genomic alterations and potential neoantigens for CSCC immunotherapy. RNA Sequencing was performed to analyze neoantigen expression. RESULTS: Systematic bioinformatics analysis showed that C>T/G>A transitions/transversions were dominant in CSCCs. Missense mutations were the most frequent types of somatic mutation in the coding sequence regions. Mutational signature analysis detected signature 2, signature 6, and signature 7 in CSCC samples. PIK3CA, FBXW7, and BICRA were identified as potential driver genes, with BICRA as a newly reported gene. Genomic variation profiling identified 4,960 potential neoantigens, of which 114 were listed in two neoantigen-related databases. CONCLUSION: The present findings contribute to our understanding of the genomic characteristics of CSCC and provide a foundation for the development of new biotechnology methods for individualized immunotherapy in CSCC."
38987584,The Hippo pathway transcription factors YAP and TAZ play HPV-type dependent roles in cervical cancer.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause most cervical cancers and an increasing number of anogenital and oral carcinomas, with most cases caused by HPV16 or HPV18. HPV hijacks host signalling pathways to promote carcinogenesis. Understanding these interactions could permit identification of much-needed therapeutics for HPV-driven malignancies. The Hippo signalling pathway is important in HPV+ cancers, with the downstream effector YAP playing a pro-oncogenic role. In contrast, the significance of its paralogue TAZ remains largely uncharacterised in these cancers. We demonstrate that TAZ is dysregulated in a HPV-type dependent manner by a distinct mechanism to that of YAP and controls proliferation via alternative cellular targets. Analysis of cervical cancer cell lines and patient biopsies revealed that TAZ expression was only significantly increased in HPV18+ and HPV18-like cells and TAZ knockdown reduced proliferation, migration and invasion only in HPV18+ cells. RNA-sequencing of HPV18+ cervical cells revealed that YAP and TAZ have distinct targets, suggesting they promote carcinogenesis by different mechanisms. Thus, in HPV18+ cancers, YAP and TAZ play non-redundant roles. This analysis identified TOGARAM2 as a previously uncharacterised TAZ target and demonstrates its role as a key effector of TAZ-mediated proliferation, migration and invasion in HPV18+ cancers."
38987116,A prognostic and predictive computational pathology immune signature for ductal carcinoma in situ: retrospective results from a cohort within the UK/ANZ DCIS trial.,"BACKGROUND: The density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be prognostic in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, manual TIL quantification is time-consuming and suffers from interobserver and intraobserver variability. In this study, we developed a TIL-based computational pathology biomarker and evaluated its association with the risk of recurrence and benefit of adjuvant treatment in a clinical trial cohort. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, a computational pathology pipeline was developed to generate a TIL-based biomarker (CPath TIL categories). Subsequently, the signature underwent a masked independent validation on H&E-stained whole-section images of 755 patients with DCIS from the UK/ANZ DCIS randomised controlled trial. Specifically, continuous biomarker CPath TIL score was calculated as the average TIL density in the DCIS microenvironment and dichotomised into binary biomarker CPath TIL categories (CPath TIL-high vs CPath TIL-low) using the median value as a cutoff. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast event (IBE; either recurrence of DCIS [DCIS-IBE] or invasive progression [I-IBE]). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). FINDINGS: CPath TIL-score was evaluable in 718 (95%) of 755 patients (151 IBEs). Patients with CPath TIL-high DCIS had a greater risk of IBE than those with CPath TIL-low DCIS (HR 2.10 [95% CI 1.39-3.18]; p=0.0004). The risk of I-IBE was greater in patients with CPath TIL-high DCIS than those with CPath TIL-low DCIS (3.09 [1.56-6.14]; p=0.0013), and the risk of DCIS-IBE was non-significantly higher in those with CPath TIL-high DCIS (1.61 [0.95-2.72]; p=0.077). A significant interaction (p(interaction)=0.025) between CPath TIL categories and radiotherapy was observed with a greater magnitude of radiotherapy benefit in preventing IBE in CPath TIL-high DCIS (0.32 [0.19-0.54]) than CPath TIL-low DCIS (0.40 [0.20-0.81]). INTERPRETATION: High TIL density is associated with higher recurrence risk-particularly of invasive recurrence-and greater radiotherapy benefit in patients with DCIS. Our TIL-based computational pathology signature has a prognostic and predictive role in DCIS.

38982928,Impact of homologous recombination repair/BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene alterations on survival in a real-world setting of metastatic prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate alterations of homologous recombination repair (HRR) and especially BReast CAncer 1/2 (BRCA1/2) gene on overall survival (OS). Moreover, to explore the effect of inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARPi) as systemic therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of all HRR-screened patients with metastatic prostate cancer, baseline characteristics were sampled. Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression models predicted the effect of HRR/BRCA1/2 alterations on OS. RESULTS: Of 196 eligible patients, 61 (31%) harboured any HRR and 40 (20%) BRCA1/2 alterations. Of HRR alterations, 40 (66%) vs six (10%) vs five (8.2%) vs four (6.6%) vs two (3.3%) vs four (6.6%) were BRCA1/2 vs Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) vs checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) vs cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) vs Fanconi anaemia complementation Group A (FANCA) vs positive for other mutations. Of these, 30% received a PARPi. OS differed significantly between HRR-positive vs -negative patients. Specifically in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the median OS was 63 (HRR positive) vs 57 (BRCA1/2 positive) vs 113 months (HRR negative) (P </= 0.01). In mCRPC, OS was 42 (HRR positive) vs 41 (BRCA1/2 positive) vs 70 months (HRR negative) (P </= 0.01). HRR and BRCA1/2 alterations were associated with worse OS after multivariable adjustment. Finally, patients with mCRPC with BRCA1/2 mutation treated without PARPi harboured worse OS than patients with BRCA1/2 mutation and PARPi therapy (median OS: 33 vs 48 months, P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: Incidence of HRR alteration in a clinical real-world setting is high when using blood- and tissue-based tests. Patients with HRR/BRCA alterations have worse outcomes resulting in significant OS differences between HRR/BRCA-positive patients with mCRPC with and without PARPi usage vs HRR/BRCA-negative patients."
38981440,Circulating tumor extracellular vesicles to monitor metastatic prostate cancer genomics and transcriptomic evolution.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by tumors are abundant in plasma, but their potential for interrogating the molecular features of tumors through multi-omic profiling remains widely unexplored. Genomic and transcriptomic profiling of circulating EV-DNA and EV-RNA isolated from in vitro and in vivo models of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) reveal a high contribution of tumor material to EV-loaded DNA/RNA, validating the findings in two cohorts of longitudinal plasma samples collected from patients during androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) or taxane-based therapy. EV-DNA genomic features recapitulate matched-patient biopsies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and associate with clinical progression. We develop a novel approach to enable transcriptomic profiling of EV-RNA (RExCuE). We report how the transcriptome of circulating EVs is enriched for tumor-associated transcripts, captures certain patient and tumor features, and reflects on-therapy tumor adaptation changes. Altogether, we show that EV profiling enables longitudinal transcriptomic and genomic profiling of mPC in liquid biopsy."
38981349,Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene signaling pathways in human cancers and their therapeutic implications.,"Cancer is a multifaceted disease driven by abnormal cell growth and poses a significant global health threat. The multifactorial causes, differences in individual susceptibility to therapeutic drugs, and induced drug resistance pose major challenges in addressing cancers effectively. One of the most important aspects in making cancers highly heterogeneous in their physiology lies in the genes involved and the changes occurring to some of these genes in malignant conditions. The Genetic factors have been implicated in the oncogenesis, progression, responses to treatment, and metastasis. One such gene that plays a key role in human cancers is the mutated form of the Ataxia-telangiectasia gene (ATM). ATM gene located on chromosome 11q23, plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability. Understanding the genetic basis of A-T is crucial for diagnosis, management, and treatment. Breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer exhibit varying relationships with the ATM gene and influence their pathways. Targeting the ATM pathway proves promising for enhancing treatment effectiveness, especially in conjunction with DNA damage response pathways. Analyzing the therapeutic consequences of ATM mutations, especially in these cancer types facilitates the approaches for early detection, intervention, development of personalized treatment approaches, and improved patient outcomes. This review emphasizes the role of the ATM gene in various cancers, highlighting its impact on DNA repair pathways and therapeutic responses."
38981309,Pan-cancer analysis of heterogeneity of tumor mutational burden and genomic mutation under treatment pressure.,"BACKGROUND: High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is one of the widely researched predictive biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been shown to be closely related with response to immunotherapy in multiple cancer types. However, for patients who have failed conventional therapy and are about to undergo immunotherapy, there is no consensus recommendation on the timing of tumor sampling for TMB analysis, and the effects of different therapies on TMB have not been clarified. This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of TMB and genomic mutation under the treatment pressure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected the available genomic and therapeutic information from 8051 samples across 15 tumor types (>50 samples/tumor) found in 30 published studies and investigated the distribution and heterogeneity of TMB under treatment across diverse cohorts. RESULTS: This integrated analysis has shown anticancer treatments increased TMB. Significant effects of treatment on TMB were more frequently observed in tumor types with lower treatment-naive TMB, including breast, prostate, and pediatric cancers. For different cancer therapies, chemotherapy was prone to be correlated with an increased TMB in most cancer types. Meanwhile, the fraction of the TMB-high category of breast, prostate, and bladder cancers and glioma increased significantly after chemotherapy. Several actionable genes including ERS1 and NF1 in breast cancer, as well as some prognostic markers including TERT in bladder cancer and IDH1 in glioma, were significantly changed in post-chemotherapy tumors compared to treatment-naive tumors. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals the heterogeneity of TMB under treatment across diverse cancer types and provides evidences that chemotherapy was associated with increases in TMB as well as the fraction of TMB-high category, suggesting that resampling tumor tissues for calculating post-chemotherapy TMB could be a better option for predicting the response to immunotherapy, especially for tumors with initially low TMB."
38980676,"Bone Pain and Survival Among Patients With Metastatic, Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of the SWOG-1216 Trial.","IMPORTANCE: The presence of bone pain is significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, there are few data regarding bone pain and survival outcomes in the context of metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (MHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To compare survival outcomes among patients with MHSPC by presence or absence of baseline bone pain at diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This post hoc secondary analysis, conducted from September 1 to December 31, 2023, used patient-level data from SWOG-1216, a phase 3, prospective randomized clinical trial that enrolled patients with newly diagnosed MHSPC from 248 academic and community centers across the US from March 1, 2013, to July 15, 2017. All patients in the intention-to-treat population who had available bone pain status were eligible and included in this secondary analysis. INTERVENTIONS: In the SWOG-1216 trial, patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with orteronel, 300 mg orally twice daily (experimental group), or ADT with bicalutamide, 50 mg orally daily (control group), until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or patient withdrawal. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival was the primary end point; progression-free survival (PFS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response were secondary end points. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for both univariable and multivariable analyses adjusting for age, treatment type, Gleason score, disease volume, Zubrod performance status, and PSA level. RESULTS: Of the 1279 male study participants, 301 (23.5%) had baseline bone pain at MHSPC diagnosis and 896 (70.1%) did not. Bone pain status was unavailable in 82 patients (6.4%). The median age of the 1197 patients eligible and included in this secondary analysis was 67.6 years (IQR, 61.8-73.6 years). Compared with patients who did not experience bone pain, those with baseline bone pain were younger (median age, 66.0 [IQR, 60.1-73.4] years vs 68.2 [IQR, 62.4-73.7] years; P = .02) and had a higher incidence of high-volume disease (212 [70.4%] vs 373 [41.6%]; P < .001). After adjustment, bone pain was associated with shorter PFS and OS. At a median follow-up of 4.0 years (IQR, 2.5-5.4 years), patients with bone pain had median PFS of 1.3 years (95% CI, 1.1-1.7 years) vs 3.7 years (95% CI, 3.3-4.2 years) in patients without initial bone pain (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.22-1.74; P < .001) and OS of 3.9 years (95% CI, 3.3-4.8 years) vs not reached (NR) (95% CI, 6.6 years to NR) in patients without initial bone pain (AHR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.34-2.05; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this post hoc secondary analysis of the SWOG-1216 randomized clinical trial, patients with baseline bone pain at MHSPC diagnosis had worse survival outcomes than those without bone pain. These data suggest prioritizing these patients for enrollment in clinical trials, may aid patient counseling, and indicate that the inclusion of bone pain in prognostic models of MHSPC may be warranted.

38979582,Promoter hypermethylation of Y-chromosome gene PRKY as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.,"Aim: To develop a methylation marker of Y-chromosome gene in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa).Materials & methods: We utilized bioinformatics analysis to identify the expression and promoter methylation of Y-chromosome gene PRKY in PCa and other common malignancies. Single-center experiments were conducted to validate the diagnostic value of PRKY promoter methylation in PCa.Results:  PRKY expression was significantly down-regulated in PCa and its mechanism may be related to promoter methylation. PRKY promoter methylation is highly specific for the diagnosis of early PCa, which may be superior to prostate-specific antigen, mpMRI and other excellent molecular biomarkers.Conclusion:  PRKY promoter methylation may be a potential marker for the early and accurate diagnosis of PCa."
38979250,Human cancer genomes harbor the mutational signature of tobacco-specific nitrosamines NNN and NNK.,"Tobacco usage is linked to multiple cancer types and accounts for a quarter of all cancer-related deaths. Tobacco smoke contains various carcinogenic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), though the mutagenic potential of many tobacco-related chemicals remains largely unexplored. In particular, the highly carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines NNN and NNK form pre-mutagenic pyridyloxobutyl (POB) DNA adducts. In the study presented here, we identified genome-scale POB-induced mutational signatures in cell lines and rat tumors, while also investigating their role in human cancer. These signatures are characterized by T>N and C>T mutations forming from specific POB adducts damaging dT and dC residues. Analysis of 2,780 cancer genomes uncovered POB signatures in  approximately 180 tumors; from cancer types distinct from the ones linked to smoking-related signatures SBS4 and SBS92. This suggests that, unlike PAH compounds, the POB pathway may contribute uniquely to the mutational landscapes of certain hematological malignancies and cancers of the kidney, breast, prostate and pancreas."
38978854,Human Leucocyte Antigen Class II Risk and Protective Alleles in Women with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.,"BACKGROUND: Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a necessary cause for development of cervical precancerous lesions and cervical cancer, however, only a small percentage of women progress to cervical cancer. The local immune response, determined, among other factors, by Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, is thought to be significant. Still the results of genome studies are inconsistent and differ between ethnical populations. The aim of the study was to assess an association between HLA-DQA1*; DQB1*; DRB1* allele's genetic variants between women with cervical precancerous lesions and healthy controls in Latvia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January until April 2017 we enrolled 84 consecutive patients referred for colposcopy to Riga East University Hospital (Latvia) due to abnormal cervical cytology results. 57 women who came for a regular check-up and had normal cytology smears were included in the control group. Material from the cervix was taken for subsequent HLA genotyping of 13 DRB1*, 8 DQA1*, and 12 DQB1* alleles. Colposcopy was performed on all participants. In case of visual suspicion for CIN cervical biopsy was done. RESULTS: There were 57 ""no CIN"" patients, 23 histologically proven CIN 1 and 61 CIN2+ cases in the study population. CIN2+ was more often associated with DQA1*0401 (OR 6.68, 95% CI 1.47-30.29, p=0.014), DRB*15 (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.22-7.39, p=0.017), DQB1*0401 (OR 2.91, 95%CI 1.11-7.68, p=0.03), DQA1*0103 (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.21, p=0.045), DRB1*11 (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.33, p=0.029) and DQB1*0301 (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.12-3.38, p=0.018). Women with ""no CIN"" more often had DQB1*0501 (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.81, p=0.026), DRB1*16 (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.78, p=0.019), DQA1*0301 (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.87, p=0.024) and DRB1*14 (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.01-0.46, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study we have demonstrated a strong association with risk and protective HLA class II alleles that are determined by the HLA-DRB1*; DQA1*; DQB1*."
38978663,Variants in Vitamin D-related Genes and Prostate Cancer Risk in Black Men.,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer has primarily been characterized among White men. However, Black men have higher prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, chronically low circulating vitamin D levels, and ancestry-specific genetic variants in vitamin D-related genes. Here, we examine six critical genes in the vitamin D pathway and prostate cancer risk in Black men. METHODS: We assessed a total of 69 candidate variants in six genes ( GC, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR , and RXRA ) including functional variants previously associated with prostate cancer and circulating 25(OHD) in White men. Associations with prostate cancer risk were examined using genome-wide association study data for approximately 10,000 prostate cancer cases and 10,000 controls among Black men and over 85,000 cases and 91,000 controls among White men. A statistical significance threshold of 0.000724 was used to account for the 69 variants tested. RESULTS: None of the variants examined were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk among Black men after multiple comparison adjustment. Four variants tested P<0.05 in Black men, including two in RXRA (rs41400444 OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.17, P = 0.024 and rs10881574 OR = 0.93, 0.87-1.00, P = 0.046) and two in VDR (rs2853563 OR = 1.07, 1.01-1.13, P = 0.017 and rs1156882 OR = 1.06, 1.00-1.12, P = 0.045). Two variants in VDR were also positively associated with risk in White men (rs11568820 OR = 1.04, 1.02-1.06, P = 0.00024 and rs4516035 OR = 1.03, 1.01-1.04, P = 0.00055). CONCLUSION: We observed suggestive non-significant associations between genetic variants in RXRA and VDR and prostate cancer risk in Black men. Future research exploring the relationship of vitamin D with cancer risk in Black men will need larger sample sizes to identify ancestry-specific variants relevant to risk in this population."
38978580,Kataegis associated mutational processes linked to adverse prostate cancer presentation in African men.,"Kataegis, the focal hypermutation of single base substitutions (SBS) in tumour genomes, has received little attention with respect to prostate cancer (PCa) associated molecular and clinical features. Most notably, data is lacking with regards to this tumour evolutionary phenomenon and PCa racial disparities, with African men disproportionately impacted. Here through comparison between African (n = 109) and non-African (n = 79) whole genome sequenced treatment naive primary tumours, using a single analytical workflow we assessed for shared and unique features of kataegis. Linking kataegis to aggressive presentation, structural variant burden and copy number loss, we attributed APOBEC3 activity through higher rates of SBS2 to high-risk African tumours. While kataegis positive African patients presented with elevated prostate specific antigen levels, their tumours showed evolutionary unique trajectories marked by increased subclonal and structural variant-independent kataegis. The potential to exacerbate tumour heterogeneity emphases the significance of continued exploration of biological behaviours and environmental exposures for African patients."
38977982,"Relationships between nine neuropsychiatric disorders and cervical cancer: insights from genetics, causality and shared gene expression patterns.","BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric disorders and cervical cancer exert substantial influences on women's health. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric disorders frequently manifest as common symptoms in cancer patients, potentially increasing the risk of malignant neoplasms. This study aimed to identify neuropsychiatric disorders that are genetically and causally related to cervical cancer and to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations. METHODS: GWAS data related to nine neuropsychiatric disorders, namely, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, depression, and alcohol dependence, were obtained to calculate heritability (h(2)) and genetic correlation (r(g)) with cervical cancer using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of the two cohorts was employed to assess the causal effects. Shared gene expression pattern analysis was subsequently conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying these significant associations. RESULTS: Anxiety, mood disorders, depression, and alcohol dependence were genetically correlated with cervical cancer (all adjusted P < 0.05). Only depression was causally related to cervical cancer in both the discovery (OR(IVW): 1.41, P(IVW) = 0.02) and replication cohorts (OR(IVW): 1.80, P(IVW) = 0.03) in the MR analysis. Gene expression pattern analysis revealed that 270 genes related to depression and cervical cancer, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF), were significantly upregulated in cervical cancer patients, while vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), transcription factor AP-1 (JUN), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were associated with prognosis in cervical cancer patients (all P < 0.05). These overlapping genes implicated the involvement of multiple biological mechanisms, such as neuron death, the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, and human papillomavirus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic, causal and molecular evidence indicates that depression increases the risk of cervical cancer. The TNF, VEGFA, JUN, and IGF-1 genes and the neuron death, PI3K-Akt, and human papillomavirus infection signalling pathways may possibly explain this association."
38977132,Phenotypic and genomic characterization of a small colony variant of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from urine of a prostate cancer case.,"Small colony variants (SCVs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae are rare and understudied. We report an SCV of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the urine of a prostate cancer patient undergoing prolonged radiotherapy. The strain was non-lactose fermenting, non-mucoid, slow-growing, multi-drug resistant, and showed atypical biochemical reactions and biofilm formation. On whole genome sequencing, it showed low-level virulence, sequence type 231 and gene CTX-M-15. Three major porins OmpK35, OmpK36 and OmpK37 were found. SCVs pose challenges like difficulties in identification, altered metabolism, and increased biofilm formation, which contribute to persistent infections. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may have led to the formation of the SCV phenotype."
38972832,"Use of Decipher Prostate Biopsy Test in Patients with Favorable-risk Disease Undergoing Conservative Management or Radical Prostatectomy in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The extent of prostate cancer found on biopsy, as well as prostate cancer grade and genomic tests, can affect clinical decision-making. The impact of these factors on the initial management approach and subsequent patient outcomes for men with favorable-grade prostate cancer has not yet been determined on a population level. Our objective was to explore the association of Decipher 22-gene genomic classifier (GC) biopsy testing on the initial use of conservative management versus radical prostatectomy (RP) and to determine the independent effect of GC scores on RP pathologic outcomes. METHODS: A total of 87 140 patients diagnosed with grade group 1 and 2 prostate cancer between 2016 and 2018 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data were linked to GC testing results (2576 tested and 84 564 untested with a GC). The primary endpoints of interest were receipt of conservative management or RP, pathologic upgrading (pathologic grade group 3-5), upstaging (pathologic >/=T3b), and adverse pathologic features (pathologic upgrading, upstaging, or lymph node invasion). Multivariable logistic regressions quantified the association of variables with outcomes of interest. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: GC tested patients were more likely to have grade group 2 on biopsy (51% vs 46%, p < 0.001) and lower prostate-specific antigen (6.1 vs 6.3, p = 0.016). Conservative management increased from 37% to 39% and from 22% to 24% during 2016-2018 for the GC tested and untested populations, respectively. GC testing was significantly associated with increased odds of conservative management (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-2.4, p < 0.001). The distribution of biopsy GC risk was as follows: 45% low risk, 30% intermediate risk, and 25% high risk. In adjusted analyses, higher GC (per 0.1 increment) scores (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.31, p < 0.001) and percent positive cores (1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with the receipt of RP. A higher GC score was significantly associated with all adverse outcomes (pathologic upgrading [OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.49, p < 0.001], upstaging [OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.62, p = 0.020], and adverse pathology [OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12-1.45, p < 0.001]). Limitations include observational biases associated with the retrospective study design. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Men who underwent GC testing were more likely to undergo conservative management. GC testing at biopsy is prognostic of adverse pathologic outcomes in a large population-based registry. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this population analysis of men with favorable-risk prostate cancer, those who underwent genomic testing at biopsy were more likely to undergo conservative management. Of men who initially underwent radical prostatectomy, higher genomic risk but not tumor volume was associated with adverse pathologic outcomes. The use of genomic testing at prostate biopsy improves risk stratification and may better inform treatment decisions than the use of tumor volume alone."
38972247,Transcriptomics analysis identified ezrin as a potential druggable target in cervical and gastric cancer cells.,"OBJECTIVE: Cancer genomics and transcriptomics studies have provided a large volume of data that enables to test of hypotheses based on real data from cancer patients. Ezrin (encoded by the EZR gene) is a highly expressed protein in cancer that contributes to linking the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane and signal transduction pathways involved in oncogenesis and disease progression. NSC305787 is a pharmacological ezrin inhibitor with potential antineoplastic effects. In the present study, the authors prospected EZR mRNA levels in a pan-cancer analysis and identified potential cancers that could benefit from anti-EZR therapies. METHODS: This study analyzed TCGA data for 32 cancer types, emphasizing cervical squamous cell carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. It investigated the impact of EZR transcript levels on clinical outcomes and identified differentially expressed genes. Cell lines were treated with NSC305787, and its effects were assessed through various cellular and molecular assays. RESULTS: EZR mRNA levels are highly expressed, and their expression is associated with biologically relevant molecular processes in cervical squamous carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. In cellular models of cervical and gastric cancer, NSC305787 reduces cell viability and clonal growth (p < 0.05). Molecular analyses indicate that the pharmacological inhibition of EZR induces molecular markers of cell death and DNA damage, in addition, to promoting the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of genes related to survival and proliferation. CONCLUSION: The present findings provide promising evidence that ezrin may be a molecular target in the treatment of cervical and gastric carcinoma."
38970292,Prostate cancer cancer-associated fibroblasts with stable markers post-androgen deprivation therapy associated with tumor progression and castration resistant prostate cancer.,"The specificity and clinical relevance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in prostate cancer (PCa), as well as the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on CAFs, remain to be fully elucidated. Using cell lineage diversity and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we pinpointed a unique CAF signature exclusive to PCa. The specificity of this CAF signature was validated through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), cell line RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. This signature associates CAFs with tumor progression, elevated Gleason scores, and the emergence of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using scRNA-seq on collected samples, we demonstrated that the CAF-specific signature is not altered by ADT, maintaining its peak signal output. Identifying a PCa-specific CAF signature and observing signaling changes in CAFs after ADT lay essential groundwork for further PCa studies."
38970106,NSUN6-mediated 5-methylcytosine modification of NDRG1 mRNA promotes radioresistance in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Radioresistance is the leading cause of death in advanced cervical cancer (CC). Dysregulation of RNA modification has recently emerged as a regulatory mechanism in radiation and drug resistance. We aimed to explore the biological function and clinical significance of 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) in cervical cancer radiosensitivity. METHODS: The abundance of RNA modification in radiotherapy-resistant and sensitive CC specimens was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The essential RNA modification-related genes involved in CC radiosensitivity were screened via RNA sequencing. The effect of NSUN6 on radiosensitivity was verified in CC cell lines, cell-derived xenograft (CDX), and 3D bioprinted patient-derived organoid (PDO). The mechanisms of NSUN6 in regulating CC radiosensitivity were investigated by integrative m(5)C sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and RNA immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: We found a higher abundance of m(5)C modification in resistant CC samples, and NSUN6 was the essential m(5)C-regulating gene concerning radiosensitivity. NSUN6 overexpression was clinically correlated with radioresistance and poor prognosis in cervical cancer. Functionally, higher NSUN6 expression was associated with radioresistance in the 3D PDO model of cervical cancer. Moreover, silencing NSUN6 increased CC radiosensitivity in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, NDRG1 was one of the downstream target genes of NSUN6 identified by integrated m(5)C-seq, mRNA-seq, and functional validation. NSUN6 promoted the m(5)C modification of NDRG1 mRNA, and the m(5)C reader ALYREF bound explicitly to the m(5)C-labeled NDRG1 mRNA and enhanced NDRG1 mRNA stability. NDRG1 overexpression promoted homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, which in turn led to radioresistance in cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant m(5)C hypermethylation and NSUN6 overexpression drive resistance to radiotherapy in cervical cancer. Elevated NSUN6 expression promotes radioresistance in cervical cancer by activating the NSUN6/ALYREF-m(5)C-NDRG1 pathway. The low expression of NSUN6 in cervical cancer indicates sensitivity to radiotherapy and a better prognosis."
38970097,Population-Specific gene expression profiles in prostate cancer: insights from Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).,"This study investigates the genetic factors contributing to the disparity in prostate cancer incidence and progression among African American men (AAM) compared to European American men (EAM). The research focuses on employing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) on public microarray data obtained from prostate cancer patients. The study employed WGCNA to identify clusters of genes with correlated expression patterns, which were then analyzed for their connection to population backgrounds. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to understand the significance of the identified gene modules in prostate cancer pathways. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) methods were utilized for selection of biomarker genes. The results revealed 353 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AAM and EAM. Six significant gene expression modules were identified through WGCNA, showing varying degrees of correlation with prostate cancer. LASSO and CFS methods pinpointed critical genes, as well as six common genes between both approaches, which are indicative of their vital role in the disease. The XGBoost classifier validated these findings, achieving satisfactory prediction accuracy. Genes such as APRT, CCL2, BEX2, MGC26963, and PLAU were identified as key genes significantly associated with cancer progression. In conclusion, the research underlines the importance of incorporating AAM and EAM population diversity in genomic studies, particularly in cancer research. In addition, the study highlights the effectiveness of integrating machine learning techniques with gene expression analysis as a robust methodology for identifying critical genes in cancer research."
38968660,Metaproteomic analysis from cervical biopsies and cytologies identifies proteinaceous biomarkers representing both human and microbial species.,"The detection of HPV infection and microbial colonization in cervical lesions is currently done through PCR-based viral or bacterial DNA amplification. Our objective was to develop a methodology to expand the metaproteomic landscape of cervical disease and determine if protein biomarkers from both human and microbes could be detected in distinct cervical samples. This would lead to the development of multi-species proteomics, which includes protein-based lateral flow diagnostics that can define patterns of microbes and/or human proteins relevant to disease status. In this study, we collected both non-frozen tissue biopsy and exfoliative non-fixed cytology samples to assess the consistency of detecting human proteomic signatures between the cytology and biopsy samples. Our results show that proteomics using biopsies or cytologies can detect both human and microbial organisms. Across patients, Lumican and Galectin-1 were most highly expressed human proteins in the tissue biopsy, whilst IL-36 and IL-1RA were most highly expressed human proteins in the cytology. We also used mass spectrometry to assess microbial proteomes known to reside based on prior 16S rRNA gene signatures. Lactobacillus spp. was the most highly expressed proteome in patient samples and specific abundant Lactobacillus proteins were identified. These methodological approaches can be used in future metaproteomic clinical studies to interrogate the vaginal human and microbiome structure and metabolic diversity in cytologies or biopsies from the same patients who have pre-invasive cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive cervical cancer, as well as in healthy controls to assess how human and pathogenic proteins may correlate with disease presence and severity."
38968485,The role of gut microbiota in prostate cancer progression: A Mendelian randomization study of immune mediation.,"The potential relationship between the gut microbiota and prostate cancer, possibly influenced by immune cells, remains unclear. This study employed the mediation Mendelian randomization (MR) technique to investigate the causal link between the gut microbiota, immune cells, and prostate cancer. Data on immune cell activity were sourced from Valeria Orru's research, whereas the genome-wide association study outcome dataset was obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit database. The bidirectional MR analysis utilized 5 different methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode. In addition, the mediating effect of immune cells on the gut microbiota and prostate cancer was explored using mediation analysis. Eighty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer were screened as instrumental variables. In a positive MR analysis with gut microbiota as the exposure factor, IVW showed an association between 8 gut microbiota and prostate cancer. Additionally, 9 types of immune cells have been found to be associated with prostate cancer using methods such as IVW. MR analysis of the gut microbiota on immune cells (beta1) revealed a negative correlation between Bifidobacterium and CD39+ T regulatory cells (Tregs; odds ratio [OR] = 0.785, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.627-0.983, P = .03). Furthermore, MR analysis of immune cells in prostate cancer disease (beta2) showed that CD39+Tregs are a risk factor for prostate cancer (OR = 1.215, 95% CI = 1.027-1.354, P = .04). Moreover, MR analysis of gut microbiota in prostate cancer (total effect) indicated that Bifidobacterium is a protective factor for prostate cancer (OR = 0.905, 95% CI = 0.822-0.977, P = .04). The sensitivity analysis verified the robustness of the above results. Mediation analysis demonstrated that CD39+Tregs partially mediate the causal relationship between Bifidobacterium and prostate cancer. This study demonstrates that Bifidobacterium inhibits prostate cancer progression through CD39+Tregs as mediators, providing new ideas and approaches for the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer."
38965558,GNA13 suppresses proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells via ERalpha dependent upregulation of the MYC oncogene.,"GNA13 (Galpha13) is one of two alpha subunit members of the G12/13 family of heterotrimeric G-proteins which mediate signaling downstream of GPCRs. It is known to be essential for embryonic development and vasculogenesis and has been increasingly shown to be involved in mediating several steps of cancer progression. Recent studies found that Galpha13 can function as an oncogene and contributes to progression and metastasis of multiple tumor types, including ovarian, head and neck and prostate cancers. In most cases, Galpha12 and Galpha13, as closely related alpha-subunits in the subfamily, have similar cellular roles. However, in recent years their differences in signaling and function have started to emerge. We previously identified that Galpha13 drives invasion of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro. As a highly heterogenous disease with various well-defined molecular subtypes (ER+ /Her2-, ER+ /Her2+, Her2+, TNBC) and subtype associated outcomes, the function(s) of Galpha13 beyond TNBC should be explored. Here, we report the finding that low expression of GNA13 is predictive of poorer survival in breast cancer, which challenges the conventional idea of Galpha12/13 being universal oncogenes in solid tumors. Consistently, we found that Galpha13 suppresses the proliferation in multiple ER+ breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and T47D). Loss of GNA13 expression drives cell proliferation, soft-agar colony formation and in vivo tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. To evaluate the mechanism of Galpha13 action, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis on these cell lines and found that loss of GNA13 results in the upregulation of MYC signaling pathways in ER+  breast cancer cells. Simultaneous silencing of MYC reversed the proliferative effect from the loss of GNA13, validating the role of MYC in Galpha13 regulation of proliferation. Further, we found Galpha13 regulates the expression of MYC, at both the transcript and protein level in an ERalpha dependent manner. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence for a tumor suppressive role for Galpha13 in breast cancer cells and demonstrates for the first time the direct involvement of Galpha13 in ER-dependent regulation of MYC signaling. With a few exceptions, elevated Galpha13 levels are generally considered to be oncogenic, similar to Galpha12. This study demonstrates an unexpected tumor suppressive role for Galpha13 in ER+ breast cancer via regulation of MYC, suggesting that Galpha13 can have subtype-dependent tumor suppressive roles in breast cancer."
38965538,"Analysis of human papillomavirus type 16 E4, E5 and L2 gene variations among women with cervical infection in Xinjiang, China.","BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of cervical cancer in Xinjiang. Genetic variation in human papillomavirus may increase its ability to invade, spread, and escape host immune response. METHODS: HPV16 genome was sequenced for 90 positive samples of HPV16 infection. Sequences of the E4, E5 and L2 genes were analysed to reveal sequence variation of HPV16 in Xinjiang and the distribution of variation among the positive samples of HPV16 infection. RESULTS: Eighty-one of the 90 samples of HPV16 infection showed variation in HPV16 E4 gene with 18 nucleotide variation sites, of which 8 sites were synonymous variations and 11 missense variations. 90 samples of HPV16 infection showed variation in HPV16 E5 and L2 genes with 16 nucleotide variation sites (6 synonymous, 11 missense variations) in the E5 gene and 100 nucleotide variation sites in L2 gene (37 synonymous, 67 missense variations). The frequency of HPV16 L2 gene missense variations G3377A, G3599A, G3703A, and G3757A was higher in the case groups than in the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that 87 samples were European strains, 3 cases were Asian strains, there were no other variations, and G4181A was related to Asian strains. HPV16 L2 gene missense variations G3377A, G3599A, G3703A, and G3757A were significantly more frequent in the case groups than in the control groups."
38964997,PTEN Loss Is Associated with Adverse Outcomes in the Setting of Salvage Radiation Therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Salvage radiation therapy (SRT) is a mainstay of treatment for biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy; however, few studies have examined genomic biomarkers in this context. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the prognostic impact of previously identified deleterious molecular phenotypes-loss of PTEN, ERG expression, and TP53 mutation-for patients undergoing SRT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We leveraged an institutional database of 320 SRT patients with available tissue and follow-up. Tissue microarrays were used for genetically validated immunohistochemistry assays. INTERVENTION: All men underwent SRT with or without androgen deprivation therapy OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Univariable and multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models assessed the association of molecular phenotypes with biochemical recurrence-free (bRFS) and metastasis-free (MFS) survival after SRT. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Loss of PTEN (n = 123, 43%) and ERG expression (n = 118, 39%) were common in this cohort, while p53 overexpression (signifying TP53 missense mutation) was infrequent (n = 21, 7%). In univariable analyses, any loss of PTEN portended worse bRFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86; 95% confidence interval 1.36-2.57) and MFS (HR 1.89; 1.21-2.94), with homogeneous PTEN loss being associated with the highest risk of MFS (HR 2.47; 1.54-3.95). Similarly, p53 overexpression predicted worse bRFS (HR 1.95; 1.14-3.32) and MFS (HR 2.79; 1.50-5.19). ERG expression was associated with worse MFS only (HR 1.6; 1.03-2.48). On the multivariable analysis adjusting for known prognostic features, homogeneous PTEN loss remained predictive of adverse bRFS (HR 1.82; 1.12-2.96) and MFS (HR 2.08; 1.06-4.86). The study is limited by its retrospective and single-institution design. CONCLUSIONS: PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry is an independent adverse prognostic factor for bRFS and MFS in prostate cancer patients treated with SRT. Future trials will determine the optimal approach to treating SRT patients with adverse molecular prognostic features. PATIENT SUMMARY: Loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein is associated with worse outcomes after salvage radiotherapy, independent of other clinical or pathologic patient characteristics."
38964723,Network toxicological and molecular docking to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity of agricultural chemical Thiabendazole.,"Food safety is closely linked to human health. Thiabendazole is widely used as a fungicide and deodorant on agricultural products like vegetables and fruits to prevent fungal infections during transport and storage. This study aims to investigate the toxicity and potential mechanisms of Thiabendazole using novel network toxicology and molecular docking techniques. First, the ADMETlab2.0 and ADMETsar databases, along with literature, predicted Thiabendazole's potential to induce cancer and liver damage. Disease target libraries were constructed using GeneCards and TCMIP databases, while Thiabendazole target libraries were constructed using Swiss Target Prediction and TCMIP databases. The Venn database identified potential targets associated with Thiabendazole-induced cancer and liver injury. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were derived from the STRING database, and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways were obtained from the DAVID database. Molecular docking assessed the binding affinity between Thiabendazole and core targets. The study revealed 29 potential targets for Thiabendazole-induced cancer and 30 potential targets for liver injury. PPI identified 5 core targets for Thiabendazole-induced cancers and 4 core targets for induced liver injury. KEGG analysis indicated that Thiabendazole might induce gastric and prostate cancer via cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targets, and liver injury through the same targets, with the p53 signaling pathway being central. GO analysis indicated that Thiabendazole-induced cancers and liver injuries were related to mitotic cell cycle G2/M transition and DNA replication. Molecular docking showed stable binding of Thiabendazole with core targets including CDK1, CDK2, EGFR, and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1). These findings suggest Thiabendazole may affect the G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle through the p53 signaling pathway, potentially inducing cancer and liver injury. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the potential molecular mechanisms underlying Thiabendazole toxicity, aiding in the prevention and treatment of related diseases. Additionally, the network toxicology approach accelerates the elucidation of toxic pathways for uncharacterized agricultural chemicals."
38962952,piRNA PROPER Suppresses DUSP1 Translation by Targeting N(6)-Methyladenosine-Mediated RNA Circularization to Promote Oncogenesis of Prostate Cancer.,"Genetic and epigenetic alterations occur in many physiological and pathological processes. The existing knowledge regarding the association of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their genetic variants on risk and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is limited. In this study, three genome-wide association study datasets are combined, including 85,707 PCa cases and 166,247 controls, to uncover genetic variants in piRNAs. Functional investigations involved manipulating piRNA expression in cellular and mouse models to study its oncogenetic role in PCa. A specific genetic variant, rs17201241 is identified, associated with increased expression of PROPER (piRNA overexpressed in prostate cancer) in tumors and are located within the gene, conferring an increased risk and malignant progression of PCa. Mechanistically, PROPER coupled with YTHDF2 to recognize N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and facilitated RNA-binding protein interactions between EIF2S3 at 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and YTHDF2/YBX3 at 3'-UTR to promote DUSP1 circularization. This m(6)A-dependent mRNA-looping pattern enhanced DUSP1 degradation and inhibited DUSP1 translation, ultimately reducing DUSP1 expression and promoting PCa metastasis via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of PROPER expression using antagoPROPER effectively suppressed xenograft growth, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Thus, targeting piRNA PROPER-mediated genetic and epigenetic fine control is a promising strategy for the concurrent prevention and treatment of PCa."
38962453,A causal link between circulating leukocytes and three major urologic cancers: a mendelian randomization investigation.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the influence of serum leukocytes on urologic cancers (UC) using observation-based investigations. In the present study, Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to assess the link between leukocyte count (LC) and the risk of UC development. METHODS: Five LC and three major UC patient prognoses were obtained for MR analysis from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Furthermore, in order to evaluate reverse causality, bidirectional studies were conducted. Finally, a sensitivity analysis using multiple methods was carried out. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation found in the genetic assessment of differential LC between the co-occurrence of bladder cancer (BCA) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Conversely, an individual 1-standard deviation (SD) rise in neutrophil count was strongly linked to a 9.3% elevation in prostate cancer (PCA) risk ([odd ratio]OR = 1.093, 95% [confidence interval]CI = 0.864-1.383, p = 0.002). Reverse MR analysis suggested that PCA was unlikely to cause changes in neutrophil count. Additional sensitivity studies revealed that the outcomes of all MR evaluations were similar, and there was no horizontal pleiotropy. Primary MR analysis using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) revealed that differential lymphocyte count significantly influenced RCC risk (OR = 1.162, 95%CI = 0.918-1.470, p = 0.001). Moreover, altered basophil count also affected BCA risk (OR = 1.249, 95% CI = 0.904-1.725, p = 0.018). Nonetheless, these causal associations were not significant in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: In summary, the results revealed that increased neutrophil counts represent a significant PCA risk factor. The current research indicates a significant relationship between immune cell activity and the cause of UC."
38962407,Treatment escalation and de-escalation of de-novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.,"Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors combined with androgen deprivation therapy have become the standard of care for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), regardless of tumor volume or risk. However, survival of approximately one-third of these patients has not improved, necessitating further treatment escalation. On the other hand, for patients with oligometastatic mCSPC, there is an emerging role for local radiation therapy. Although data remain scarce, it is expected that treatment of both primary tumor as well as metastasis-directed therapy may improve survival outcomes. In these patients, systemic therapy may be de-escalated to intermittent therapy. However, precise risk stratification is necessary for risk-based treatment escalation or de-escalation. In addition to risk stratification based on clinical parameters, research has been conducted to incorporate genomic and/or transcriptomic data into risk stratification. In future, an integrated risk model is expected to precisely stratify patients and guide treatment strategies. Here, we first review the transition of the standard treatment for mCSPC over the last decade and further discuss the newest concept of escalating or de-escalating treatment using a multi-modal approach based on the currently available literature."
38961106,Bergenin inhibits growth of human cervical cancer cells by decreasing Galectin-3 and MMP-9 expression.,"Cervical cancer is still the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide even after introduction of vaccine against Human papillomavirus (HPV), due to low vaccine coverage, especially in the developing world. Cervical cancer is primarily treated by Chemo/Radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage, with Carboplatin/Cisplatin-based drug regime. These drugs being non-specific, target rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells, so safer options are needed for lower off-target toxicity. Natural products offer an attractive option compared to synthetic drugs due to their well-established safety profile and capacity to target multiple oncogenic hallmarks of cancer like inflammation, angiogenesis, etc. In the current study, we investigated the effect of Bergenin (C-glycoside of 4-O-methylgallic acid), a natural polyphenol compound that is isolated from medicinal plants such as Bergenia crassifolia, Caesalpinia digyna, and Flueggea leucopyrus. Bergenin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, and wound healing properties but its anticancer potential has been realized only recently. We performed a proteomic analysis of cervical carcinoma cells treated with bergenin and found it to influence multiple hallmarks of cancers, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor suppressor proteins. It was also involved in many different cellular processes unrelated to cancer, as shown by our proteomic analysis. Further analysis showed bergenin to be a potent-angiogenic agent by reducing key angiogenic proteins like Galectin 3 and MMP-9 (Matrix Metalloprotease 9) in cervical carcinoma cells. Further understanding of this interaction was carried out using molecular docking analysis, which indicated MMP-9 has more affinity for bergenin as compared to Galectin-3. Cumulatively, our data provide novel insight into the anti-angiogenic mechanism of bergenin in cervical carcinoma cells by modulation of multiple angiogenic proteins like Galectin-3 and MMP-9 which warrant its further development as an anticancer agent in cervical cancer."
38960143,"DNA methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3, HTERT and FAM19A4 are useful for detection of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or worse: Analysis of individual CpG-sites outperforms averaging.","Global methylation analysis of gene promoters is promising for detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+) in high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-positive women. However, diagnostic performance of methylation data at individual CpG-sites is limited. We explored methylation for predicting HSIL+ in self- and clinician-collected samples from Papua New Guinea. Methylation of EPB41L3 (1-6 CpG-sites), hTERT (1-10 CpG-sites) and FAM19A4 (1-5 CpG-sites) was assessed through pyrosequencing from 44 HPV+ samples (4 cancers, 19 HSIL, 4 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 17 normal). New primers were designed for FAM19A4 directed to the first exon region not explored previously. In clinician-collected samples, methylation at CpG-sites 4 and 5 of EPB41L3 were the best HSIL predictors (AUC >0.83) and CpG-site 4 for cancer (0.925). Combination of EPB41L3 sites 2/4 plus FAM19A4 site 1 were the best HSIL+ markers [100% sensitivity, 63.2% specificity]. Methylation at CpG-site 5 of FAM19A4 was the best HSIL predictor (0.67) in self-collected samples, and CpG-sites 1 and 3 of FAM19A4 for cancer (0.77). Combined, FAM19A4 site 1 plus HPV 16/18 detection yielded sensitivity of 82.6% and specificity of 61.9%. In conclusion, methylation at individual CpG-sites of EPB41L3 and FAM19A4 outperformed global analysis and improved HSIL+ detection, warranting further investigation."
38959543,"Dissecting prostate Cancer: Single-Cell insight into Macrophage Diversity, molecular Prognosticators, and the role of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase F.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains a prominent challenge in oncology, with advanced stages showing poor prognosis. The tumor microenvironment (TME), and particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), plays a crucial role in disease progression. This study explores the single-cell transcriptomics of prostate cancer, determines macrophage heterogeneity, identifies prognostic gene markers, and assesses the role of PPIF in TAMs. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database (GSE176031) and transcriptome data from the TCGA were processed to characterize cell populations and identify prognostic genes in prostate cancer. Macrophage subpopulations were examined through clustering, followed by gene set scoring based on migration, activation, and proliferation. PPIF expression in macrophages was investigated using multiplex immunofluorescence staining on matched prostate cancer and adjacent non-tumoral tissues. RESULTS: The single-cell analysis identified 9,178 cells, categorized into 10 principal cell types, with macrophages constituting a significant part of the immune microenvironment. Four macrophage subgroups demonstrated distinct functional pathways: phagocytic, immune-regulatory, and proliferative. A total of 39 genes correlated with prostate cancer prognosis were identified, of which 10 carried the most significant prognostic information. Peptidylprolyl Isomerase F (PPIF) expression was significantly higher in TAMs from tumor tissue than normal tissue, indicating its potential regulatory role in the immune microenvironment. CONCLUSION: The intricate cellular architecture of the prostate cancer TME has been elucidated, with a focus on macrophage heterogeneity and functional specialization. Prognostic genes, including PPIF, were associated with survival outcomes, providing potential therapeutic targets. PPIF's prominent expression in TAMs may serve as a lever in cancer progression, warranting further investigation as a biomarker and a molecule of interest for therapeutic targeting within the prostate cancer milieu."
38956684,Transcriptomic response of prostate cancer cells to carbon ion and photon irradiation with focus on androgen receptor and TP53 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is essential in the treatment of prostate cancer. An alternative to conventional photon radiotherapy is the application of carbon ions, which provide a superior intratumoral dose distribution and less induced damage to adjacent healthy tissue. A common characteristic of prostate cancer cells is their dependence on androgens which is exploited therapeutically by androgen deprivation therapy in the advanced prostate cancer stage. Here, we aimed to analyze the transcriptomic response of prostate cancer cells to irradiation by photons in comparison to carbon ions, focusing on DNA damage, DNA repair and androgen receptor signaling. METHODS: Prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (functional TP53 and androgen receptor signaling) and DU145 (dysfunctional TP53 and androgen receptor signaling) were irradiated by photons or carbon ions and the subsequent DNA damage was assessed by immuno-cytofluorescence. Furthermore, the cells were treated with an androgen-receptor agonist. The effects of irradiation and androgen treatment on the gene regulation and the transcriptome were investigated by RT-qPCR and RNA sequencing, followed by bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Following photon or carbon ion irradiation, both LNCaP and DU145 cells showed a dose-dependent amount of visible DNA damage that decreased over time, indicating occurring DNA repair. In terms of gene regulation, mRNAs involved in the TP53-dependent DNA damage response were significantly upregulated by photons and carbon ions in LNCaP but not in DU145 cells, which generally showed low levels of gene regulation after irradiation. Both LNCaP and DU145 cells responded to photons and carbon ions by downregulation of genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle, partially resembling the transcriptome response to the applied androgen receptor agonist. Neither photons nor carbon ions significantly affected canonical androgen receptor-dependent gene regulation. Furthermore, certain genes that were specifically regulated by either photon or carbon ion irradiation were identified. CONCLUSION: Photon and carbon ion irradiation showed a significant congruence in terms of induced signaling pathways and transcriptomic responses. These responses were strongly impacted by the TP53 status. Nevertheless, irradiation mode-dependent distinct gene regulations with undefined implication for radiotherapy outcome were revealed. Androgen receptor signaling and irradiations shared regulation of certain genes with respect to DNA-repair and cell-cycle."
38956663,Comparative analysis of genetic risk scores for predicting biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has identified risk variants related to complex diseases, but most genetic variants have less impact on phenotypes. To solve the above problems, methods that can use variants with low genetic effects, such as genetic risk score (GRS), have been developed to predict disease risk. METHODS: As the GRS model with the most incredible prediction power for complex diseases has not been determined, our study used simulation data and prostate cancer data to explore the disease prediction power of three GRS models, including the simple count genetic risk score (SC-GRS), the direct logistic regression genetic risk score (DL-GRS), and the explained variance weighted GRS based on directed logistic regression (EVDL-GRS). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We used 26 SNPs to establish GRS models to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Combining clinical variables such as age at diagnosis, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, pathologic T stage, and surgical margin and GRS models has better predictive power for BCR. The results of simulation data (statistical power = 0.707) and prostate cancer data (area under curve = 0.8462) show that DL-GRS has the best prediction performance. The rs455192 was the most relevant locus for BCR (p = 2.496 x 10(-6)) in our study."
38954116,Role of ZNF334 in cervical cancer: implications for EMT reversal and tumor suppression.,"Zinc-finger proteins are involved in many biological processes. However, the role of Zinc-finger protein 334 (ZNF334) in cervical cancer remains unidentified. This study showed that promoter methylation of ZNF334 was responsible for its reduced expression. ZNF334 suppressed malignant biological behaviors in cervical cancer. Notably, ZNF334 reversed the EMT process both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq coupled with bioinformatics analysis caught P3H3 which is upregulated by ZNF334. Dual-luciferase reporter and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays illustrated that ZNF334 directly regulate P3H3. Knockdown of P3H3 attenuated the reversal of EMT induced by ZNF334. Additionally, ZNF334 overexpression sensitized cervical cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel, cyclosporine and sunitinib. In conclusions, this study illustrated that DNA methylation-based silencing ZNF334 played a vital role in cervical cancer, by regulating P3H3 in turn affects EMT. ZNF334 has the potential to become a novel diagnostic biomarker and a potential treatment target for cervical cancer."
38953550,Association of Genomic Prostate Score at positive margin with recurrence after radical prostatectomy.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of the 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score(R) (GPS; MDxHealth, Irvine, CA, USA) performed on prostate cancer at the positive margin of the radical prostatectomy (RP) for its association with risk of subsequent biochemical recurrence (BCR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We designed a case-cohort for the outcome of BCR, selecting 223 from a cohort of 813 RP patients treated at Johns Hopkins from 2008 to 2017 with positive margins and available clinical data; of these, 213 had available tissue and clinical data. RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue adjacent to the positive surgical margin and the GPS was evaluable in 203 of these patients with a score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher risk. All patients underwent RP with or without adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). The statistical analysis employed Cox proportional hazards regression models for outcome of BCR weighted for case-cohort design. RESULTS: In univariable analysis, every 20-unit increase in the GPS was associated with a nearly threefold increase in risk of BCR (hazard ratio [HR] per 20 units 2.82, P < 0.001). In a multivariable Cox model adjusted for age, race, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical score, Grade Group at the positive margin, and ART, the GPS was significantly associated with BCR (HR 1.56 per 20 units; 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.19; P = 0.011). The study is limited by its retrospective and single institution design. CONCLUSIONS: The GPS at the positive surgical margin could help stratify prognosis and inform clinical decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy after RP."
38952985,Labeled-free quantitative proteomic analysis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma identifies potential protein biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a prevalent cancer among women, and reliance on surgical and radio-chemical therapies can irreversibly affect patients' life span and quality of life. Thus, early diagnosis and further exploration into the pathogenesis of cervical cancer are crucial. Mass spectrometry technology is widely applied in clinical practice and can be used to further investigate the protein alterations during the onset of cervical cancer. METHODS: Employing labeled-free quantitative proteomics technology and bioinformatics tools, we analyzed and compared the differential protein expression profiles between normal cervical squamous cell tissues and cervical squamous cell cancer tissues. GEPIA is an online website for analyzing the RNA sequencing expression data of tumor and normal tissue data from the TCGA and the GTEx databases. This approach aided in identifying qualitative and quantitative changes in key proteins related to the progression of cervical cancer. RESULTS: Compared to normal samples, a total of 562 differentially expressed proteins were identified in cervical cancer samples, including 340 up-regulated and 222 down-regulated proteins. Gene ontology functional annotation, and KEGG pathway, and enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins mainly participated in metabolic pathways, spliceosomes, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesion signaling pathways. Specifically, desmoplakin (DSP), protein phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 13 like (PPP1R13L) and ANXA8 may be involved in cervical tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptotic signal transmission. Moreover, we used GEPIA database to validate the expression of DSP, PPP1R13L and ANXA8 in human cancers and normal cervix. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified 562 differentially expressed proteins, and there were three proteins expressed higher in the cervical cancer tissues. The functions and signaling pathways of these differentially expressed proteins lay a theoretical foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cervical cancer."
38950902,Machine learning enables pan-cancer identification of mutational hotspots at persistent CTCF binding sites.,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an insulator protein that binds to a highly conserved DNA motif and facilitates regulation of three-dimensional (3D) nuclear architecture and transcription. CTCF binding sites (CTCF-BSs) reside in non-coding DNA and are frequently mutated in cancer. Our previous study identified a small subclass of CTCF-BSs that are resistant to CTCF knock down, termed persistent CTCF binding sites (P-CTCF-BSs). P-CTCF-BSs show high binding conservation and potentially regulate cell-type constitutive 3D chromatin architecture. Here, using ICGC sequencing data we made the striking observation that P-CTCF-BSs display a highly elevated mutation rate in breast and prostate cancer when compared to all CTCF-BSs. To address whether P-CTCF-BS mutations are also enriched in other cell-types, we developed CTCF-INSITE-a tool utilising machine learning to predict persistence based on genetic and epigenetic features of experimentally-determined P-CTCF-BSs. Notably, predicted P-CTCF-BSs also show a significantly elevated mutational burden in all 12 cancer-types tested. Enrichment was even stronger for P-CTCF-BS mutations with predicted functional impact to CTCF binding and chromatin looping. Using in vitro binding assays we validated that P-CTCF-BS cancer mutations, predicted to be disruptive, indeed reduced CTCF binding. Together this study reveals a new subclass of cancer specific CTCF-BS DNA mutations and provides insights into their importance in genome organization in a pan-cancer setting."
38949888,"Microsatellite Instability, Tumor Mutational Burden, and Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Patients with Prostate Cancer.","PURPOSE: Patients with microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) and high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H) prostate cancers are candidates for pembrolizumab. We define the genomic features, clinical course, and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H prostate cancers without MSI [TMB-H/microsatellite stable (MSS)]. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequenced 3,244 tumors from 2,257 patients with prostate cancer. MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancer was defined as an MSIsensor score >/=10 or MSIsensor score >/=3 and <10 with a deleterious MMR alteration. TMB-H was defined as >/=10 mutations/megabase. PSA50 and RECIST responses were assigned. Overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were compared using log-rank test. RESULTS: Sixty-three (2.8%) men had MSI-H/dMMR, and 33 (1.5%) had TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers. Patients with MSI-H/dMMR and TMB-H/MSS tumors more commonly presented with grade group 5 and metastatic disease at diagnosis. MSI-H/dMMR tumors had higher TMB, indel, and neoantigen burden compared with TMB-H/MSS. Twenty-seven patients with MSI-H/dMMR and 8 patients with TMB-H/MSS tumors received ICB, none of whom harbored polymerase epsilon (polE) catalytic subunit mutations. About 45% of patients with MSI-H/dMMR had a RECIST response, and 65% had a PSA50 response. No patient with TMB-H/MSS had a RECIST response, and 50% had a PSA50 response. rPFS tended to be longer in patients with MSI-H/dMMR than in patients with TMB-H/MSS who received immunotherapy. Pronounced differences in genomics, TMB, or MSIsensor score were not detected between MSI-H/dMMR responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancers have greater TMB, indel, and neoantigen burden than TMB-H/MSS prostate cancers, and these differences may contribute to profound and durable responses to ICB."
38948854,Identify Regulatory eQTLs by Multiome Sequencing in Prostate Single Cells.,"While genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis have made significant progress in identifying noncoding variants associated with prostate cancer risk and bulk tissue transcriptome changes, the regulatory effect of these genetic elements on gene expression remains largely unknown. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing have made it possible to perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq profiling simultaneously to capture functional associations between chromatin accessibility and gene expression. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that this multiome single-cell approach allows for mapping regulatory elements and their target genes at prostate cancer risk loci. We applied a 10X Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform to encapsulate Tn5 transposase-tagged nuclei from multiple prostate cell lines for a total of 65,501 high quality single cells from RWPE1, RWPE2, PrEC, BPH1, DU145, PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines. To address data sparsity commonly seen in the single-cell sequencing, we performed targeted sequencing to enrich sequencing data at prostate cancer risk loci involving 2,730 candidate germline variants and 273 associated genes. Although not increasing the number of captured cells, the targeted multiome data did improve eQTL gene expression abundance by about 20% and chromatin accessibility abundance by about 5%. Based on this multiomic profiling, we further associated RNA expression alterations with chromatin accessibility of germline variants at single cell levels. Cross validation analysis showed high overlaps between the multiome associations and the bulk eQTL findings from GTEx prostate cohort. We found that about 20% of GTEx eQTLs were covered within the significant multiome associations (p-value </= 0.05, gene abundance percentage >/= 5%), and roughly 10% of the multiome associations could be identified by significant GTEx eQTLs. We also analyzed accessible regions with available heterozygous SNP reads and observed more frequent association in genomic regions with allelically accessible variants (p = 0.0055). Among these findings were previously reported regulatory variants including rs60464856-RUVBL1 (multiome p-value = 0.0099 in BPH1) and rs7247241-SPINT2 (multiome p-value = 0.0002- 0.0004 in 22Rv1). We also functionally validated a new regulatory SNP and its target gene rs2474694-VPS53 (multiome p-value = 0.00956 in BPH1 and 0.00625 in DU145) by reporter assay and SILAC proteomics sequencing. Taken together, our data demonstrated the feasibility of the multiome single-cell approach for identifying regulatory SNPs and their regulated genes."
38947889,Cardio-oncology in advanced prostate cancer.,"Treatment intensification with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPi) have led to improved survival in advanced prostate cancer. However, ADT is linked to significant cardiovascular toxicity, and ARPi also negatively impacts cardiovascular health. Together with a higher prevalence of baseline cardiovascular risk factors reported among prostate cancer survivors at diagnosis, there is a pressing need to prioritise and optimise cardiovascular health in this population. Firstly, While no dedicated cardiovascular toxicity risk calculators are available, other tools such as SCORE2 can be used for baseline cardiovascular risk assessment. Next, selected patients on combination therapy may benefit from de-escalation of ADT to minimise its toxicities while maintaining cancer control. These patients can be characterised by an exceptional PSA response to hormonal treatment, favourable disease characteristics and competing comorbidities that warrant a less aggressive treatment regime. In addition, emerging molecular and genomic biomarkers hold the potential to identify patients who are suited for a de-escalated treatment approach either with ADT or with ARPi. One such biomarker is AR-V7 splice variant that predicts resistance to ARPi. Lastly, optimization of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors for patients through a coherent framework (ABCDE) and exercise therapy is equally important. This article aims to comprehensively review the cardiovascular impact of hormonal manipulation in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, propose overarching strategies to mitigate cardiovascular toxicity associated with hormonal treatment, and, most importantly, raise awareness about the detrimental cardiovascular effects inherent in our current management strategies involving hormonal agents."
38947033,The Gene Expression Landscape of Disease Genes.,"Fine-mapping and gene-prioritisation techniques applied to the latest Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results have prioritised hundreds of genes as causally associated with disease. Here we leverage these recently compiled lists of high-confidence causal genes to interrogate where in the body disease genes operate. Specifically, we combine GWAS summary statistics, gene prioritisation results and gene expression RNA-seq data from 46 tissues and 204 cell types in relation to 16 major diseases (including 8 cancers). In tissues and cell types with well-established relevance to the disease, the prioritised genes typically have higher absolute and relative (i.e. tissue/cell specific) expression compared to non-prioritised 'control' genes. Examples include brain tissues in psychiatric disorders (P-value < 1x10(-7)), microglia cells in Alzheimer's Disease (P-value = 9.8x10(-3)) and colon mucosa in colorectal cancer (P-value < 1x10(-3)). We also observe significantly higher expression for disease genes in multiple tissues and cell types with no established links to the corresponding disease. While some of these results may be explained by cell types that span multiple tissues, such as macrophages in brain, blood, lung and spleen in relation to Alzheimer's disease (P-values < 1x10(-3)), the cause for others is unclear and motivates further investigation that may provide novel insights into disease etiology. For example, mammary tissue in Type 2 Diabetes (P-value < 1x10(-7)); reproductive tissues such as breast, uterus, vagina, and prostate in Coronary Artery Disease (P-value < 1x10(-4)); and motor neurons in psychiatric disorders (P-value < 3x10(-4)). In the GTEx dataset, tissue type is the major predictor of gene expression but the contribution of each predictor (tissue, sample, subject, batch) varies widely among disease-associated genes. Finally, we highlight genes with the highest levels of gene expression in relevant tissues to guide functional follow-up studies. Our results could offer novel insights into the tissues and cells involved in disease initiation, inform drug target and delivery strategies, highlighting potential off-target effects, and exemplify the relative performance of different statistical tests for linking disease genes with tissue and cell type gene expression."
38947031,Rare pathogenic structural variants show potential to enhance prostate cancer germline testing for African men.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is highly heritable, with men of African ancestry at greatest risk and associated lethality. Lack of representation in genomic data means germline testing guidelines exclude for African men. Established that structural variations (SVs) are major contributors to human disease and prostate tumourigenesis, their role is under-appreciated in familial and therapeutic testing. Utilising a clinico-methodologically matched African (n = 113) versus European (n = 57) deep-sequenced PCa resource, we interrogated 42,966 high-quality germline SVs using a best-fit pathogenicity prediction workflow. We identified 15 potentially pathogenic SVs representing 12.4% African and 7.0% European patients, of which 72% and 86% met germline testing standard-of-care recommendations, respectively. Notable African-specific loss-of-function gene candidates include DNA damage repair MLH1 and BARD1 and tumour suppressors FOXP1, WASF1 and RB1. Representing only a fraction of the vast African diaspora, this study raises considerations with respect to the contribution of kilo-to-mega-base rare variants to PCa pathogenicity and African associated disparity."
38946889,mRNA-lncRNA gene expression signature in HPV-associated neoplasia and cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in women and is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) in 70 % of cases. Cervical cancer occurs because of progression of low-differentiated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia through grade 2 and 3 lesions. Along with the protein-coding genes, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of malignant cell transformation. Although human papillomavirus is widespread, there is currently no well-characterized transcriptomic signature to predict whether this tumor will develop in the presence of HPV-associated neoplastic changes in the cervical epithelium. Changes in gene activity in tumors reflect the biological diversity of cellular phenotype and physiological functions and can be an important diagnostic marker. We performed comparative transcriptome analysis using open RNA sequencing data to assess differentially expressed genes between normal tissue, neoplastic epithelium, and cervical cancer. Raw data were preprocessed using the Galaxy platform. Batch effect correction, identification of differentially expressed genes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using R programming language packages. Subcellular localization of lncRNA was analyzed using Locate-R and iLoc-LncRNA 2.0 web services. 1,572 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were recorded in the ""cancer vs. control"" comparison, and 1,260 DEGs were recorded in the ""cancer vs. neoplasia"" comparison. Only two genes were observed to be differentially expressed in the ""neoplasia vs. control"" comparison. The search for common genes among the most strongly differentially expressed genes among all comparison groups resulted in the identification of an expression signature consisting of the CCL20, CDKN2A, CTCFL, piR-55219, TRH, SLC27A6 and EPHA5 genes. The transcription level of the CCL20 and CDKN2A genes becomes increased at the stage of neoplastic epithelial changes and stays so in cervical cancer. Validation on an independent microarray dataset showed that the differential expression patterns of the CDKN2A and SLC27A6 genes were conserved in the respective gene expression comparisons between groups."
38946034,WGCNA reveals a biomarker for cancer-associated fibroblasts to predict prognosis in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are crucial components of the cervical cancer tumor microenvironment, playing a significant role in cervical cancer progression, treatment resistance, and immune evasion, but whether the expression of CAF-related genes can predict clinical outcomes in cervical cancer is still unknown. In this study, we sought to analyze genes associated with CAFs through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and to create a predictive model for CAFs in cervical cancer. METHODS: We acquired transcriptome sequencing data and clinical information on cervical cancer patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases. WGCNA was conducted to identify genes related to CAFs. We developed a prognostic model based on CAF genes in cervical cancer using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Single-cell sequencing data analysis and in vivo experiments for validation of hub genes in CAFs. RESULTS: A prognostic model for cervical cancer was developed based on CAF genes including COL4A1 , LAMC1 , RAMP3 , POSTN , and SERPINF1 . Cervical cancer patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on the optimal cutoff value. Patients in the high-risk group had a significantly worse prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that hub genes in the CAFs risk model were expressed mainly in fibroblasts. The real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results revealed a significant difference in the expression levels of COL4A1 , LAMC1 , POSTN , and SERPINF1 between the cancer group and the normal group ( p < 0.05). Consistently, the results of the immunohistochemical tests exhibited notable variations in COL4A1, LAMC1, RAMP3, POSTN, and SERPINF1 expression between the cancer and normal groups ( p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The CAF risk model for cervical cancer constructed in this study can be used to predict prognosis, while the CAF hub genes can be utilized as crucial markers for cervical cancer prognosis."
38944914,GRIN3A: A biomarker associated with a cribriform pattern and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer with a cribriform pattern, including invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC) and/or intraductal carcinoma (IDC) is associated with a poor prognosis, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to identify biomarkers for this feature. Using a radical prostatectomy cohort, we performed within-patient differential expression analyses with RNA sequencing data to compare samples with a cribriform pattern to those with non-cribriform Gleason pattern 4 (NcGP4; n=13). ACSM1, GRIN3A, PCDHB2, and REG4 were identified as differentially expressed, and validation was performed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (n=99; 321 RNA samples) and RNA in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays (n=479; 2047 tissue cores). GRIN3A was significantly higher expressed in cribriform pattern vs. NcGP4, when assessed within the same patient (n=27; p=0.005) and between different patients (n=83; p=0.001). Tissue cores with IDC more often expressed GRIN3A compared to ICC, NcGP4, and benign tissue (52 % vs. </= 32 %). When IDC and NcGP4 was compared within the same patient (173 pairs of tissue cores; 54 patients), 38 (22 %) of the tissue microarray core pairs had GRIN3A expression in only IDC, 33 (19 %) had expression in both IDC and NcGP4, 14 (8 %) in only NcGP4 and 88 (51 %) were negative in both entities (p=0.001). GRIN3A was as well associated with biochemical recurrence (log-rank, p=0.002). In conclusion, ectopic GRIN3A expression is an RNA-based biomarker for the presence of cribriform prostate cancer, particularly for IDC."
38944419,"CEACAM6 Promotes Lung Metastasis via Enhancing Proliferation, Migration and Suppressing Apoptosis of Prostate Cancer Cells.","BACKGROUND/AIM: Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) results in high morbidity and mortality. Visceral metastases in particular are associated with a shortened survival. Our aim was to unravel the molecular mechanisms that underly pulmonary spread in mPCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of PCa lung metastases, followed by functional validation of candidate genes. Digital gene expression analysis utilizing the NanoString technology was performed on mRNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from PCa lung metastases. The gene expression data from primary PCa and PCa lung metastases were compared, and several publicly available bioinformatic analysis tools were used to annotate and validate the data. RESULTS: In PCa lung metastases, 234 genes were considerably up-regulated, and 78 genes were significantly down-regulated when compared to primary PCa. Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) was identified as suitable candidate gene for further functional validation. CEACAM6 as a cell adhesion molecule has been implicated in promoting metastatic disease in several solid tumors, such as colorectal or gastric cancer. We showed that siRNA knockdown of CEACAM6 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells resulted in decreased cell viability and migration as well as enhanced apoptosis. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses identified several genes of interest that might promote metastatic spread to the lung. CONCLUSION: Functional validation revealed that CEACAM6 might play an important role in fostering metastatic spread to the lung of PCa patients via enhancing proliferation, migration and suppressing apoptosis in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. CEACAM6 might pose an attractive therapeutic target to prevent metastatic disease."
38943346,Taxonomy of introns and the evolution of minor introns.,"Classification of introns, which is crucial to understanding their evolution and splicing, has historically been binary and has resulted in the naming of major and minor introns that are spliced by their namesake spliceosome. However, a broad range of intron consensus sequences exist, leading us to here reclassify introns as minor, minor-like, hybrid, major-like, major and non-canonical introns in 263 species across six eukaryotic supergroups. Through intron orthology analysis, we discovered that minor-like introns are a transitory node for intron conversion across evolution. Despite close resemblance of their consensus sequences to minor introns, these introns possess an AG dinucleotide at the -1 and -2 position of the 5' splice site, a salient feature of major introns. Through combined analysis of CoLa-seq, CLIP-seq for major and minor spliceosome components, and RNAseq from samples in which the minor spliceosome is inhibited we found that minor-like introns are also an intermediate class from a splicing mechanism perspective. Importantly, this analysis has provided insight into the sequence elements that have evolved to make minor-like introns amenable to recognition by both minor and major spliceosome components. We hope that this revised intron classification provides a new framework to study intron evolution and splicing."
38942821,Down-regulation of SLC14A1 in prostate cancer activates CDK1/CCNB1 and mTOR pathways and promotes tumor progression.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men in the United States and the leading cause of cancer-related death. The Solute Carrier Family 14 Member 1 (SLC14A1) is a member of urea transporters which are important for the regulation of urine concentration. However, the physiological significance of SLC14A1 in PCa still remains unclear. In the present study, via bioinformatics analysis and experiments, we found that expression of SLC14A1 is significantly decreased in PCa progression, which could be attributed to hypermethylation on SLC14A1 promoter region. Moreover, its low expression and hypermethylation on SLC14A1 promoter are closely related to the poor prognosis of PCa patients. On the other hand, overexpression of SLC14A1 inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis while its overexpression also suppressed CDK1/CCNB1 pathway and mTOR/MMP-9 signaling pathway. Additionally, SLC14A1 expression is enriched in prostate basal-type cells. In summary, our study indicates that its low expression level and promoter hypermethylation of SLC14A1 may represent novel indicators for PCa progression and prognosis, and SLC14A1 could inhibit the progression of PCa."
38940339,A Linear Relationship between the Number of Cancers among First-Degree Relatives and the Risk of Multiple Primary Cancers.,"With advances in the early detection and treatment of cancer, the incidence of multiple primary cancers (MPC) or second primary cancers has increased over time. Characterization of etiologic risk factors, including family history of cancer, within the general population is critical for assessing MPC risk in patients. We examined the association between family history of cancer among first-degree relatives and MPC risk in a prospective study of 139,958 participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusting for potential confounders. Over a median follow-up of 16 years (IQR: 11-19 years), 6,170 participants were diagnosed with MPC. Having a family history of cancer increased the risk of MPC by 18% (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.24). A positive linear trend was observed between the reported number of cancers in the family history and MPC risk with HRs (95% CI) of 1.13 (1.07-1.20), 1.23 (1.14-1.33), 1.29 (1.15-1.45), and 1.42 (1.20-1.70) for one, two, three, and four or more cancers among first-degree relatives, respectively (Ptrend = 2.36 x 10-13). No significant differences were observed by cancer histology or specific cancer types reported in the family history. Our study demonstrates that the family history of cancer is an important risk factor for the development of MPCs and that a comprehensive assessment of the number of cancers reported among first-degree relatives may identify those at higher risk who may benefit from targeted cancer prevention and screening strategies. Prevention Relevance: Our study makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of risk factors for MPCs in the general population. It demonstrates that individuals with a strong family history of cancer are at higher risk for MPCs and may benefit from more targeted cancer prevention and screening interventions."
38938900,Cancer cell invasion alters the protein profile of extracellular vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of intercellular communication involved in local and long-range signalling of cancer metastasis. The onset of invasion is the key step of the metastatic cascade, but the secretion of EVs has remained unexplored at that stage due to technical challenges. In this study, we present a platform to track EVs over the course of invasive development of human prostate cancer cell (PC3) tumoroids utilizing in vivo-mimicking extracellular matrix-based 3D cultures. Using this EV production method, combined with proteomic profiling, we show that PC3 tumoroids secrete EVs with previously undefined protein cargo. Intriguingly, an increase in EV amounts and extensive changes in the EV protein composition were detected upon invasive transition of the tumoroids. The changes in EV protein cargo were counteracted by chemical inhibition of invasion. These results reveal the impact of the tumoroids' invasive status on EV secretion and cargo, and highlight the necessity of in vivo-mimicking conditions for uncovering novel cancer-derived EV components."
38938675,Identification of stable reference genes for relative quantification of long RNA expression in urinary extracellular vesicles.,"Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are rich in valuable biomolecule information which are increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers for various diseases. uEV long RNAs are among the critical cargos capable of providing unique transcriptome information of the source cells. However, consensus regarding ideal reference genes for relative long RNAs quantification in uEVs is not available as of date. Here we explored stable reference genes through profiling the long RNA expression by RNA-seq following unsupervised analysis and validation studies. Candidate reference genes were identified using four algorithms: NormFinder, GeNorm, BestKeeper and the Delta Ct method, followed by validation. RNA profile showed uEVs contained abundant long RNAs information and the core transcriptome was related to cellular structures, especially ribosome which functions mainly as translation, protein and RNA binding molecules. Analysis of RNA-seq data identified RPL18A, RPL11, RPL27, RACK1, RPSA, RPL41, H1-2, RPL4, GAPDH, RPS27A as candidate reference genes. RT-qPCR validation revealed that RPL41, RPSA and RPL18A were reliable reference genes for long RNA quantification in uEVs from patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic nephropathy (DN), IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and prostate cancer (PCA). Interestingly, RPL41 also outperformed traditional reference genes in renal tissues of DN and IgAN, as well as in plasma EVs of several types of cancers. The stable reference genes identified in this study may facilitate development of uEVs as novel biomarkers and increase the accuracy and comparability of biomarker studies."
38937754,Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) gene signatures predict outcomes in breast and prostate tumor patients.,"BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, tumor-derived RNA expression signatures have been developed for the two most commonly diagnosed tumors worldwide, namely prostate and breast tumors, in order to improve both outcome prediction and treatment decision-making. In this context, molecular signatures gained by main components of the tumor microenvironment, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been explored as prognostic and therapeutic tools. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the significance of CAFs-related gene signatures in breast and prostate cancers still remains to be disclosed. METHODS: RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) was employed to profile and compare the transcriptome of CAFs isolated from patients affected by breast and prostate tumors. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) characterizing breast and prostate CAFs were intersected with data from public datasets derived from bulk RNA-seq profiles of breast and prostate tumor patients. Pathway enrichment analyses allowed us to appreciate the biological significance of the DEGs. K-means clustering was applied to construct CAFs-related gene signatures specific for breast and prostate cancer and to stratify independent cohorts of patients into high and low gene expression clusters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were employed to predict differences in the outcome parameters of the clusters of patients. Decision-tree analysis was used to validate the clustering results and boosting calculations were then employed to improve the results obtained by the decision-tree algorithm. RESULTS: Data obtained in breast CAFs allowed us to assess a signature that includes 8 genes (ITGA11, THBS1, FN1, EMP1, ITGA2, FYN, SPP1, and EMP2) belonging to pro-metastatic signaling routes, such as the focal adhesion pathway. Survival analyses indicated that the cluster of breast cancer patients showing a high expression of the aforementioned genes displays worse clinical outcomes. Next, we identified a prostate CAFs-related signature that includes 11 genes (IL13RA2, GDF7, IL33, CXCL1, TNFRSF19, CXCL6, LIFR, CXCL5, IL7, TSLP, and TNFSF15) associated with immune responses. A low expression of these genes was predictive of poor survival rates in prostate cancer patients. The results obtained were significantly validated through a two-step approach, based on unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification) learning techniques, showing a high prediction accuracy (>/= 90%) in independent RNA-seq cohorts. CONCLUSION: We identified a huge heterogeneity in the transcriptional profile of CAFs derived from breast and prostate tumors. Of note, the two novel CAFs-related gene signatures might be considered as reliable prognostic indicators and valuable biomarkers for a better management of breast and prostate cancer patients."
38937672,Causal relationship between prostatic diseases and prostate cancer: a mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Although it is thought that prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is related to prostate cancer (PCa), the underlying causal effects of these diseases are unclear. METHODS: We assessed the causal relationship between prostatitis or BPH and PCa using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. The data utilized in this study were sourced from genome-wide association study. The association of genetic variants from cohorts of prostatitis or BPH and PCa patients was determined using inverse-variance weighted and MR Egger regression techniques. The direction of chance was determined using independent genetic variants with genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-6)). The accuracy of the results was confirmed using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: MR analysis showed that BPH had a significant causal effect on PCa (Odds Ratio = 1.209, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.098-0.281, P = 5.079 x 10(- 5)) while prostatitis had no significant causal effect on PCa (P > 0.05). Additionally, the pleiotropic test and leave-one-out analysis showed the two-sample MR analyses were valid and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: This MR study supports that BPH has a positive causal effect on PCa, while genetically predicted prostatitis has no causal effect on PCa. Nonetheless, further studies should explore the underlying biochemical mechanism and potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of these diseases."
38937536,Should systematic prostatic biopsies be discontinued?,"INTRODUCTION: The use of systematic biopsies in addition to targeted biopsies is based on multiple studies showing that 15-20% of ""clinically significant"" cancers are missed on targeted biopsies. Concern about these 'missed' cancers drives many interventions. This includes systematic biopsies in men with negative imaging and in men having targeted biopsies, and drives a preference for total gland treatment in men who may be candidates for partial gland ablation. This article summarizes recent genomic and clinical data indicating that, despite ""clinically significant"" histology, MRI invisible lesions are genomically and clinically favorable. These studies have demonstrated that the genetic aberrations associated with cancer visibility are the same aberrations that drive cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Thus invisible cancers, even if undiagnosed at baseline, are in most cases indolent and pose little threat to the patient. The implications are that patients should be monitored with imaging rather than systematic biopsy, and subject to repeat targeted biopsy for evidence of MR progression. Patients prefer this strategy. It has many advantages in terms of reduced burden of care, cost, psychological benefits, and less diagnosis of insignificant cancer. CONCLUSION: It is now appropriate to abandon systematic biopsies in most patients."
38937531,Causal role of immune cells on cervical cancer onset revealed by two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a prevalent gynecological cancer worldwide that significantly impacts the quality of life and the physical and mental well-being of women. However, there have been limited studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the connection between immune cells and CC. This study is to investigate the causal effects of immune traits on CC and non-neoplastic conditions of the cervix. The GWAS data for 731 immunophenotypes and six GWAS data for CC from the FinnGen database were downloaded. Subsequently, a two-sample MR analysis was conducted using the MR Egger, Weighted median, Inverse variance weighted (IVW), Simple mode, and Weighted mode methods. Our study has identified the potential causal effects of immune traits on inflammatory diseases of the cervix, other noninflammatory disorders of the cervix uteri, carcinoma in situ of cervix uteri, adenocarcinomas of cervix, squamous cell neoplasms and carcinoma of cervix, as well as malignant neoplasm of the cervix uteri, with the respective numbers being 8, 6, 11, 8, 23, and 12, respectively. A strong correlation between classic monocytes and various cervical diseases was revealed. Furthermore, we discovered that B cells expressing BAFF-R have the ability to impede the advancement of malignant CC, specifically squamous cell neoplasms and carcinoma of cervix. Our study has demonstrated a significant association between immune traits and both CC and non-neoplastic conditions of the cervix through two-sample Mendelian randomization, providing valuable insights for future clinical research."
38936897,Ovarian Metastasis from Human Papillomavirus-associated Usual-type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma: Clinicopathological Characteristics for Distinguishing from Primary Ovarian Mucinous or Endometrioid Tumor.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Distinguishing ovarian metastasis of usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (UEA) from primary ovarian tumors is often challenging because of several overlapping features. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of patients with metastatic ovarian UEA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological information was collected from eight patients with metastatic ovarian UEA. Immunostaining was also performed. RESULTS: Most patients presented with adnexal masses that were suspected to be primary ovarian tumors. All examined cases showed block p16 positivity in paired primary and metastatic tumors. Five patients who completed post-operative chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) did not experience recurrence. In contrast, one patient who refused further treatment after the first CCRT cycle experienced ovarian and peritoneal metastases. One patient with isolated ovarian metastasis left untreated and developed peritoneal metastasis during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients with UEA who received proper management for ovarian metastases showed favorable outcomes. Given that ovarian metastatic UEA can mimic primary ovarian borderline tumor or carcinoma of the mucinous or endometrioid type, pathologists should be aware of this unusual but distinctive morphology to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment."
38936774,HPV16 genome structure analysis in oropharyngeal cancer PDXs identifies tumors with integrated and episomal genomes.,"HPV + oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) incidence recently surpassed cervical cancer and is the most common HPV-related cancer in the developed world. HPV16 is in  approximately 90 % of HPV + OPCs, with episomal genomes in the majority of cases. Most existing HPV16+ cancer cell lines derive from outside the oropharynx and harbor integrated HPV genomes. Thus, there is need for OPC preclinical models to evaluate standard and experimental therapeutics in the presence of episomal HPV16 oncogenic drivers. Here we characterize HPV genome structures in eight HPV16+ OPC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and evaluate their responses to standard chemotherapy. HPV genome state was investigated by combining Southern blot, T5 exonuclease assay, whole genome sequencing, and RNAseq data. This analysis revealed complexity and variation in integrated vs. episomal HPV forms across PDXs and demonstrated that four PDXs predominantly contain episomal HPV16. Episomal status did not ensure favorable in vivo responses to cisplatin therapy, despite the more favorable prognosis previously attributed to episomal HPV + tumors; this could be due to the small number present in the dataset. Our analysis establishes PDX models as test platforms for novel therapies designed to target maintenance of the episomal forms of HPV16 that commonly appear in OPC."
38935882,Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Prostate Cancer Care: A Path to Enhanced Efficiency and Outcomes.,"The landscape of prostate cancer care has rapidly evolved. We have transitioned from the use of conventional imaging, radical surgeries, and single-agent androgen deprivation therapy to an era of advanced imaging, precision diagnostics, genomics, and targeted treatment options. Concurrently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has dramatically transformed the paradigm for artificial intelligence (AI). This convergence of advancements in prostate cancer management and AI provides a compelling rationale to comprehensively review the current state of AI applications in prostate cancer care. Here, we review the advancements in AI-driven applications across the continuum of the journey of a patient with prostate cancer from early interception to survivorship care. We subsequently discuss the role of AI in prostate cancer drug discovery, clinical trials, and clinical practice guidelines. In the localized disease setting, deep learning models demonstrated impressive performance in detecting and grading prostate cancer using imaging and pathology data. For biochemically recurrent diseases, machine learning approaches are being tested for improved risk stratification and treatment decisions. In advanced prostate cancer, deep learning can potentially improve prognostication and assist in clinical decision making. Furthermore, LLMs are poised to revolutionize information summarization and extraction, clinical trial design and operations, drug development, evidence synthesis, and clinical practice guidelines. Synergistic integration of multimodal data integration and human-AI integration are emerging as a key strategy to unlock the full potential of AI in prostate cancer care."
38933923,Decoding the immune landscape: a comprehensive analysis of immune-associated biomarkers in cervical carcinoma and their implications for immunotherapy strategies.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cervical cancer, a prevalent gynecological malignant tumor, poses a significant threat to women's health and lives. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for treating cervical cancer. For patients with persistent or recurrent metastatic cervical cancer, If the sequence of dead receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) is positive, ICI show significant clinical efficacy. PD-L1 expression serves as a valuable biomarker for assessing ICI therapeutic efficacy. However, the complex tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), encompassing immune cell composition and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) status, also exerts a profound influence on tumor immunity and prognosis. Given the remarkable strides made by ICI treatments in improving the survival rates of cervical cancer patients, it becomes essential to identify a comprehensive biomarker that integrates various TIME aspects to enhance the effectiveness of ICI treatment. Therefore, the quest for biomarkers linked to multiple facets of TIME in cervical cancer is a vital pursuit. METHODS: In this study, we have developed an Immune-Associated Gene Prognostic Index (IRGPI) with remarkable prognostic value specifically for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). The Cancer Genome Atlas CESC dataset (n = 305) was meticulously analyzed to pinpoint key immune-related genes via weighted gene co-expression network analysis and differential gene expression assays. Subsequently, we employed Cox regression analysis to construct the IRGPI. Furthermore, the composition of immune cells and TIL status were examined using CIBERSORT and TIDE. Tumor expression of Epigen, LCN10, and P73 were determined with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The resulting IRGPI, composed of EPGN, LCN10, and TP73 genes, displayed a strong negative correlation with patient survival. The discovery was validated with a patient cohort from our hospital. The IRGPI not only predicts the composition of immune cell subtypes such as Macrophages M1, NK cells, Mast cells, Plasma cells, Neutrophils, Dendritic cells, T cells CD8, and T cells CD4 within CESC, but also indicates TIL exclusion, dysfunction, and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression. Therefore, the IRGPI emerges as a promising biomarker not only for prognostic assessment but also for characterizing multiple immune features in CESC. Additionally, our results underscored the significant associations between the IRGPI and immune cell composition, TIL exclusion, and dysfunction, along with PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in the TIME. CONCLUSION: Consequently, the IRGPI stands out as a biomarker intimately connected to both the survival and TIME status of CESC patients, offering potential insights into immunotherapy strategies for CESC."
38932701,ONECUT2 acts as a lineage plasticity driver in adenocarcinoma as well as neuroendocrine variants of prostate cancer.,"Androgen receptor- (AR-) indifference is a mechanism of resistance to hormonal therapy in prostate cancer (PC). Here we demonstrate that ONECUT2 (OC2) activates resistance through multiple drivers associated with adenocarcinoma, stem-like and neuroendocrine (NE) variants. Direct OC2 gene targets include the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; NR3C1) and the NE splicing factor SRRM4, which are key drivers of lineage plasticity. Thus, OC2, despite its previously described NEPC driver function, can indirectly activate a portion of the AR cistrome through epigenetic activation of GR. Mechanisms by which OC2 regulates gene expression include promoter binding, enhancement of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, and super-enhancer reprogramming. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 suppresses lineage plasticity reprogramming induced by the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide. These results demonstrate that OC2 activation promotes a range of drug resistance mechanisms associated with treatment-emergent lineage variation in PC and support enhanced efforts to therapeutically target OC2 as a means of suppressing treatment-resistant disease."
38932482,Identification of transcriptionally-active human papillomavirus integrants through nanopore sequencing reveals viable targets for gene therapy against cervical cancer.,"Integration of the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome into the cellular genome is a key event that leads to constitutive expression of viral oncoprotein E6/E7 and drives the progression of cervical cancer. However, HPV integration patterns differ on a case-by-case basis among related malignancies. Next-generation sequencing technologies still face challenges for interrogating HPV integration sites. In this study, utilizing Nanopore long-read sequencing, we identified 452 and 108 potential integration sites from the cervical cancer cell lines (CaSki and HeLa) and five tissue samples, respectively. Based on long Nanopore chimeric reads, we were able to analyze the methylation status of the HPV long control region (LCR), which controls oncogene E6/E7 expression, and to identify transcriptionally-active integrants among the numerous integrants. As a proof of concept, we identified an active HPV integrant in between RUNX2 and CLIC5 on chromosome 6 in the CaSki cell line, which was supported by ATAC-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analysis. Knockout of the active HPV integrant, by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, dramatically crippled cell proliferation and induced cell senescence. In conclusion, identifying transcriptionally-active HPV integrants with Nanopore sequencing can provide viable targets for gene therapy against HPV-associated cancers."
38932472,An Inherited Allele Confers Prostate Cancer Progression and Drug Resistance via RFX6/HOXA10-Orchestrated TGFbeta Signaling.,"Genetic and epigenetic alterations are cancer hallmark characteristics. However, the role of inherited cancer predisposition alleles in co-opting lineage factor epigenetic reprogramming and tumor progression remains elusive. Here the FinnGen cohort phenome-wide analysis, along with multiple genome-wide association studies, has consistently identified the rs339331-RFX6/6q22 locus associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk across diverse populations. It is uncovered that rs339331 resides in a reprogrammed androgen receptor (AR) binding site in PCa tumors, with the T risk allele enhancing AR chromatin occupancy. RFX6, an AR-regulated gene linked to rs339331, exhibits synergistic prognostic value for PCa recurrence and metastasis. This comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the oncogenic functions of RFX6 in promoting PCa cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, RFX6 upregulates HOXA10 that profoundly correlates with adverse PCa outcomes and is pivotal in RFX6-mediated PCa progression, facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and modulating the TGFbeta/SMAD signaling axis. Clinically, HOXA10 elevation is associated with increased EMT scores, tumor advancement and PCa recurrence. Remarkably, reducing RFX6 expression restores enzalutamide sensitivity in resistant PCa cells and tumors. This findings reveal a complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance, centered around disrupted prostate lineage AR signaling and abnormal RFX6 expression."
38932266,Short Communication: Understanding the Barriers to Cervical Cancer Prevention and HPV Vaccination in Saudi Arabia.,"Cervical cancer, along with other sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) conditions, poses a significant burden in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Despite the availability of effective preventive methods such as vaccinations, particularly against the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), awareness about such preventive methods and HPV vaccination remains alarmingly low in the KSA, even with governmental effort and support. While many women are aware of the risks, the uptake of the HPV vaccine remains below 10% (7.6%) at the country level. This highlights the urgent need for Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) at the community level to raise awareness, dispel misconceptions, and empower women to embrace vaccinations. Additionally, there is a need to revitalize the cancer registry system to better track and monitor cervical cancer cases. This short communication aims to map these barriers while identifying opportunities for impactful research. Drawing from the scientific literature, government reports, and expert insights, we highlight the challenges surrounding the tackling of HPV. By exploring diverse sources of knowledge, this paper not only highlights current obstacles but also proposes actionable solutions for future interventions."
38932197,HPV16 Phylogenetic Variants in Anogenital and Head and Neck Cancers: State of the Art and Perspectives.,"HPV16 is responsible for approximately 60% and 90% of global HPV-induced cervical and oropharyngeal cancers, respectively. HPV16 intratype variants have been identified by HPV genome sequencing and classified into four phylogenetic lineages (A-D). Our understanding of HPV16 variants mostly derives from epidemiological studies on cervical cancer (CC) in which HPV16 B, C, and D lineages (previously named ""non-European"" variants) were mainly associated with high-grade cervical lesions and cancer. Although a predominance of HPV16 lineage A (previously named ""European variants"") has been observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), epidemiological and in vitro biological studies are still limited for this tumor site. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the entire HPV genome has deepened our knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of HPV variants in CC and HNSCC. Research on cervical cancer has shown that certain HPV16 sublineages, such as D2, D3, A3, and A4, are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, and sublineages A4, D2, and D3 are linked to a higher risk of developing adenocarcinomas. Additionally, lineage C and sublineages D2 or D3 of HPV16 show an elevated risk of developing premalignant cervical lesions. However, it is still crucial to conduct large-scale studies on HPV16 variants in different HPV-related tumor sites to deeply evaluate their association with disease development and outcomes. This review discusses the current knowledge and updates on HPV16 phylogenetic variants distribution in HPV-driven anogenital and head and neck cancers."
38932179,Findings and Challenges in Replacing Traditional Uterine Cervical Cancer Diagnosis with Molecular Tools in Private Gynecological Practice in Mexico.,"We have been encouraging practicing gynecologists to adopt molecular diagnostics tests, PCR, and cancer biomarkers, as alternatives enabled by these platforms, to traditional Papanicolaou and colposcopy tests, respectively. An aliquot of liquid-based cytology was used for the molecular test [high-risk HPV types, (HR HPV)], another for the PAP test, and one more for p16/Ki67 dual-stain cytology. A total of 4499 laboratory samples were evaluated, and we found that 25.1% of low-grade samples and 47.9% of high-grade samples after PAP testing had a negative HR HPV-PCR result. In those cases, reported as Pap-negative, 22.1% had a positive HR HPV-PCR result. Dual staining with p16/Ki67 biomarkers in samples was positive for HR HPV, and 31.7% were also positive for these markers. Out of the PCR results that were positive for any of these HR HPV subtypes, n 68.3%, we did not find evidence for the presence of cancerous cells, highlighting the importance of performing dual staining with p16/Ki67 after PCR to avoid unnecessary colposcopies. The encountered challenges are a deep-rooted social reluctance in Mexico to abandon traditional Pap smears and the opinion of many specialists. Therefore, we still believe that colposcopy continues to be a preferred procedure over the dual-staining protocol."
38927984,"Circulating Tumor DNA in Genitourinary Cancers: Detection, Prognostics, and Therapeutic Implications.","CtDNA is emerging as a non-invasive clinical detection method for several cancers, including genitourinary (GU) cancers such as prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). CtDNA assays have shown promise in early detection of GU cancers, providing prognostic information, assessing real-time treatment response, and detecting residual disease and relapse. The ease of obtaining a ""liquid biopsy"" from blood or urine in GU cancers enhances its potential to be used as a biomarker. Interrogating these ""liquid biopsies"" for ctDNA can then be used to detect common cancer mutations, novel genomic alterations, or epigenetic modifications. CtDNA has undergone investigation in numerous clinical trials, which could address clinical needs in GU cancers, for instance, earlier detection in RCC, therapeutic response prediction in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and monitoring for recurrence in bladder cancers. The utilization of liquid biopsy for ctDNA analysis provides a promising method of advancing precision medicine within the field of GU cancers."
38927930,Bioinformatics Analysis of Human Papillomavirus 16 Integration in Cervical Cancer: Changes in MAGI-1 Expression in Premalignant Lesions and Invasive Carcinoma.,"HPV 16 integration is crucial for the onset and progression of premalignant lesions to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC) because it promotes the amplification of proto-oncogenes and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes; some of these are proteins with PDZ domains involved in homeostasis and cell polarity. Through a bioinformatics approach based on interaction networks, a group of proteins associated with HPV 16 infection, PDZ domains, and direct physical interaction with E6 and related to different hallmarks of cancer were identified. MAGI-1 was selected to evaluate the expression profile and subcellular localization changes in premalignant lesions and ISCC with HPV 16 in an integrated state in cervical cytology; the profile expression of MAGI-1 diminished according to lesion grade. Surprisingly, in cell lines CaSki and SiHa, the protein localization was cytoplasmic and nuclear. In contrast, in histological samples, a change in subcellular localization from the cytoplasm in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) to the nucleus in the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was observed; in in situ carcinomas and ISCC, MAGI-1 expression was absent. In conclusion, MAGI-1 expression could be a potential biomarker for distinguishing those cells with normal morphology but with HPV 16 integrated from those showing morphology-related uterine cervical lesions associated with tumor progression."
38927892,Multi-Cohort Transcriptomic Profiling of Medical Gas Plasma-Treated Cancers Reveals the Role of Immunogenic Cell Death.,"The therapeutic potential of cold physical gas plasma operated at atmospheric pressure in oncology has been thoroughly demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies. The cytotoxic effect on malignant cells has been attributed mainly to biologically active plasma-generated compounds, namely, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species interferes strongly with the antioxidant defense system of malignant cells, activating multiple signaling cascades and inevitably leading to oxidative stress-induced cell death. This study aims to determine whether plasma-induced cancer cell death operates through a universal molecular mechanism that is independent of the cancer cell type. Using whole transcriptome data, we sought to investigate the activation mechanism of plasma-treated samples in patient-derived prostate cell cultures, melanoma, breast, lymphoma, and lung cancer cells. The results from the standardized single-cohort gene expression analysis and parallel multi-cohort meta-analysis strongly indicate that plasma treatment globally induces cancer cell death through immune-mediated mechanisms, such as interleukin signaling, Toll-like receptor cascades, and MyD88 activation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine release and tumor antigen presentation."

38926832,Exploring molecular targets: herbal isolates in cervical cancer therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer (CxCa) stands as a significant global health challenge, ranking fourth in cancer-related mortality among the female population. While chemotherapy regimens have demonstrated incremental progress in extending overall survival, the outlook for recurrent CxCa patients remains disheartening. An imperative necessity arises to delve into innovative therapeutic avenues, with molecular targeted therapy emerging as a promising candidate. Previous investigations have shed light on the therapeutic effectiveness of five distinct herbal compounds, epicatechin, curcumin, myricetin, jatrorrhizine, and arborinine, within the context of CxCa. METHODS: A systems biology approach was employed to discern differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CxCa tissues relative to healthy cervical epithelial tissues. A protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) was constructed, anchored in the genes related to CxCa. The central genes were discerned within the PPIN, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves explored their prognostic significance. An assessment of the binding affinity of the selected herbal compounds to the master regulator of prognostic markers in CxCa was conducted. RESULTS: A significant correlation between the overexpression of MYC, IL6, JUN, RRM2, and VEGFA and an adverse prognosis in CxCa was indicated. The regulation of these markers is notably influenced by the transcription factor CEBPD. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the binding affinity between myricetin and the CEBPD DNA binding site was robust. CONCLUSION: The findings presented herein have unveiled pivotal genes and pathways that play a central role in the malignant transformation of CxCa. CEBPD has emerged as a potential target for harnessing the therapeutic potential of myricetin in this context."
38924839,"Enhancer demethylation-regulated gene score identified molecular subtypes, inspiring immunotherapy or CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: The 5-year survival rate of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is approximately 20%. The prognosis and drug response exhibit substantial heterogeneity in ESCC, impeding progress in survival outcomes. Our goal is to identify a signature for tumour subtype classification, enabling precise clinical treatments. METHODS: Utilising pre-treatment multi-omics data from an ESCC dataset (n = 310), an enhancer methylation-eRNA-target gene regulation network was constructed and validated by in vitro experiments. Four machine learning methods collectively identified core target genes, establishing an Enhancer Demethylation-Regulated Gene Score (EDRGS) model for classification. The molecular function of EDRGS subtyping was explored in scRNA-seq (n = 60) and bulk-seq (n = 310), and the EDRGS's potential to predict treatment response was assessed in datasets of various cancer types. FINDINGS: EDRGS stratified ESCCs into EDRGS-high/low subtypes, with EDRGS-high signifying a less favourable prognosis in ESCC and nine additional cancer types. EDRGS-high exhibited an immune-hot but immune-suppressive phenotype with elevated immune checkpoint expression, increased T cell infiltration, and IFNgamma signalling in ESCC, suggesting a better response to immunotherapy. Notably, EDRGS outperformed PD-L1 in predicting anti-PD-1/L1 therapy effectiveness in ESCC (n = 42), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC, n = 181), and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA, n = 348) cohorts. EDRGS-low showed a cell cycle-activated phenotype with higher CDK4 and/or CDK6 expression, demonstrating a superior response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, validated in ESCC (n = 26), melanoma (n = 18), prostate cancer (n = 15) cells, and PDX models derived from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 30). INTERPRETATION: Identification of EDRGS subtypes enlightens ESCC categorisation, offering clinical insights for patient management in immunotherapy (anti-PD-1/L1) and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy across cancer types. FUNDING: This study was supported by funding from the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFC2501000, 2020YFA0803300), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82030089, 82188102), the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (2021-I2M-1-018, 2022-I2M-2-001, 2021-I2M-1-067), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3332021091)."
38924078,Potential association between PSCA rs2976395 functional variant and pancreatic cancer risk.,"Correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIV) represent a small proportion of the human genome showing DNA methylation patterns that are the same in all human tissues, are different among individuals, and are partially regulated by genetic variants in cis. In this study we aimed at investigating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CoRSIVs and their involvement with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk. We analyzed 29,099 CoRSIV-SNPs and 133,615 CoRSIV-mQTLs in 14,394 cases and 247,022 controls of European and Asian descent. We observed that the A allele of the rs2976395 SNP was associated with increased PDAC risk in Europeans (p = 2.81 x 10(-5)). This SNP lies in the prostate stem cell antigen gene and is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a variant (rs2294008) that has been reported to be associated with risk of many other cancer types. The A allele is associated with the DNA methylation level of the gene according to the PanCan-meQTL database and with overexpression according to QTLbase. The expression of the gene has been observed to be deregulated in many tumors of the gastrointestinal tract including pancreatic cancer; however, functional studies are needed to elucidate the function relevance of the association."
38923577,Species-level characterization of the cervicovaginal microbiota and its role in human papillomavirus-associated cervical carcinogenesis.,"The cervicovaginal microbiome may contribute to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinogenesis, but studies have been limited by low-resolution analysis methods. Using a high-resolution bioinformatics pipeline, we evaluated the relationship of the cervicovaginal microbiome with HPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The cervicovaginal microbiome of 186 women was characterized by sequencing 16S rRNA regions (V3-V4 and V5-V6) and annotated with the high-resolution ANCHOR pipeline. Samples were genotyped for HPV using the Roche-Cobas 4800 assay. We fitted logistic regression models using stepwise forward selection to select species (presence/absence) as correlates of CIN1+ and constructed a linear microbiome-based score using the regression coefficients. An HPV-based score was calculated from a separate logistic regression model to detect CIN1+ . Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed; the area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared between scores. Overall, 66.7% of participants were HPV-positive. 77 unique species were identified: 8 using V3-V4, 48 using V5-V6, and 21 shared. Twelve species were retained via stepwise selection. The AUCs for the microbiome-, and HPV-based scores were 0.7656 (95% CI 0.6885-0.8426), and 0.7529 (95% CI 0.6855-0.8204), respectively. Bacterial species may be involved in cervical carcinogenesis as the microbiome- and HPV-based scores performed similarly for CIN1+ detection."
38920137,LINE-1 ORF1p is a Promising Biomarker in Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Degree Assessment.,"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents a spectrum of preinvasive squamous lesions within the cervical epithelium, whose identification is a diagnostic challenge due to subtle histomorphological differences among its categories. This study explores ORF1p, a nucleic acid-binding protein derived from long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), as a potential biomarker for enhancing CIN diagnosis. A comprehensive analysis of 143 cervical specimens, encompassing CIN I (n=20), CIN II (n=46), CIN III (n=14), invasive cancer (n=32), and nondysplastic cases (normal cervical epithelia (n=24) and atrophy (n=7) were conducted. ORF1p, Ki67, and p16 expressions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. ORF1p immunopositivity was detected in the vast majority [110/112 (98.2%)] of dysplastic and neoplastic (CIN and invasive cancer) specimens, whereas 19/24 (79.2%) of normal cervical specimens lacked ORF1p expression. The observed pattern of ORF1p expression showed a progressively increasing extent and intensity with advancing CIN grades. CIN I exhibited mild ORF1p expression in the lower one or two-thirds of the cervical epithelium [14/16 (87.5%)], whereas CIN II demonstrated moderate to strong ORF1p expression spanning the lower two-thirds [29/46 (63.0%)]. Pronounced transepithelial ORF1p immunopositivity characterized CIN III cases [13/14 (92.8%)] and cervical cancer [30/32 (93.8%)]. These findings propose ORF1p as a valuable indicator even for detecting CIN I, effectively discerning them from normal cervical tissue (p < 0.0001). Our findings underscore the potential of ORF1p as an early diagnostic marker for cervical neoplasia."
38918720,Proteomic profiling of prostate cancer reveals molecular signatures under antiandrogen treatment.,"BACKGROUND: Tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) are indispensably dependent on androgen receptor (AR). Antiandrogen treatment is the principal preference for patients with advanced PCa. However, the molecular characteristics of PCa with antiandrogen intervention have not yet been fully uncovered. METHODS: We first performed proteome analysis with 32 PCa tumor samples and 10 adjacent tissues using data-independent acquisition (DIA)- parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) proteomics. Then label-free quantification (LFQ) mass spectrometry was employed to analyze protein profiles in LNCaP and PC3 cells. RESULTS: M-type creatine kinase CKM and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP were demonstrated to have the potential to be diagnostic biomarkers for PCa at both mRNA and protein levels. Several E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) were significantly altered in PCa and PCa cells under enzalutamide treatment, and these proteins might reprogram proteostasis at protein levels in PCa. Finally, we discovered 127 significantly varied proteins in PCa samples with antiandrogen therapy and further uncovered 4 proteins in LNCaP cells upon enzalutamide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our research reveals new potential diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer and might help resensitize resistance to antiandrogen therapy."
38914027,Differential requirement of the transcription factor HOXC13 for the stable maintenance of human papillomavirus genome among high-risk genotypes.,"The viral genome of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), the causative agent of cervical cancer, is stably maintained as extrachromosomal episomes that establish persistent infection. We previously identified homeobox-transcription factor HOXC13 as an important host protein mediating the short-term retention of the HPV16 and HPV18 genomes in normal human immortalized keratinocytes (NIKS). Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to construct HOXC13 knockout (KO) NIKS cells to determine whether HOXC13 is required for the long-term maintenance of high-risk HPV genomes. HPV16, HPV18, HPV52, and HPV58 whole genomes were transfected into HOXC13 KO cells, and the copy number of viral genomes per cell was monitored over cell passages. Copy numbers of HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58 genomes decreased continuously in HOXC13 KO cells, whereas HPV18 genomes remained stable throughout passages. Thus, HOXC13 is critical for the stable maintenance of the viral genomes of HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58, but not HPV18."
38913213,Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Advances in Treatment and Symptom Management.,"The management of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has evolved in the past decade due to substantial advances in understanding the genomic landscape and biology underpinning this form of prostate cancer. The implementation of various therapeutic agents has improved overall survival but despite the promising advances in therapeutic options, mCRPC remains incurable. The focus of treatment should be not only to improve survival but also to preserve the patient's quality of life (QoL) and ameliorate cancer-related symptoms such as pain. The choice and sequence of therapy for mCRPC patients are complex and influenced by various factors, such as side effects, disease burden, treatment history, comorbidities, patient preference and, more recently, the presence of actionable genomic alterations or biomarkers. Docetaxel is the first-line treatment for chemo-naive patients with good performance status and those who have yet to progress on docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting. Novel androgen agents (NHAs), such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, are effective treatment options that are utilized as second-line options. These medications can be considered upfront in frail patients or patients who are NHA naive. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in mCRPC for mutations in DNA repair deficiency genes to inform treatment decisions, as for example in breast cancer gene mutation testing. Other potential biomarkers being investigated include phosphatase and tensin homologues and homologous recombination repair genes. Despite a growing number of studies incorporating biomarkers in their trial designs, to date, only olaparib in the PROFOUND study and lutetium-177 in the VISION trial have improved survival. This is an unmet need, and future trials should focus on biomarker-guided treatment strategies. The advent of novel noncytotoxic agents has enhanced targeted drug delivery and improved treatment responses with favourable toxicity profiling. Trials should continue to incorporate and report health-related QoL scores and functional assessments into their trial designs."
38912942,Use of TP4303 to identify prostate cancer cells in voided urine samples.,"INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in men worldwide. Genomic VPAC receptors are expressed on malignant prostate cancer cells and can be targeted and imaged optically by a peptide labeled fluorophore. The objective of our study was to assess the feasibility of detecting cancer of the prostate using a voided urine sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients >/= 40 years old, with lower urinary tract symptoms and serum PSA > 4 ng/mL formed the study group. The first 50 mL of voided urine sample was collected and processed. The cells that were shed in the voided urine were fixed and stained with a peptide TP4303 and incubated. The slide was then stained with DAPI which binds with the DNA in the nucleus. All patients underwent a standard 12-core TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. RESULTS: A total of 318 patients were included in the study, of these 158 were histologically confirmed cancers. Voided urine samples were positive for VPAC receptors in 154 (97.46%) of these. The remaining 160 patients had no cancer on the HPR examination and none of these patients were positive for VPAC receptors. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates our belief that patients with prostate cancer shed malignant cells in the urine that can be identified by targeting the VPAC receptors. If these results are further validated by multicentric studies, then this could form the basis for indications for a preliminary prostate biopsy in patients with elevated serum PSA but normal digital examination or in patients needing a repeat biopsy."
38912907,Characterization of Wnt Signaling Pathway Aberrations in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"Wnt (wingless-type) signaling pathway (WSP) alterations have been identified in patients with prostate cancer and are implicated in disease progression and hormonal resistance. In this study, we utilized a multi-institutional dataset to characterize molecular alterations in the canonical and noncanonical WSPs in prostate cancer. Patients with prostate cancer who underwent tissue-based genomic sequencing were investigated. Tumors with somatic activating mutations in CTNNB1 or RSPO2 or inactivating mutations in either APC or RNF43 were characterized as having aberrant canonical Wnt signaling (WSP-activated). Overall survival analyses were restricted to microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors lacking RNF43 G659fs* mutations. We also investigated noncanonical WSP by evaluation of ROR1, ROR2, and WNT5 in WSP-activated versus WSP wild-type (WSP-WT) tumors. Of 4,138 prostate cancer samples, 3,684 were MSS. Among MSS tumors, 42.4% were from metastatic sites, of which 19.1% were WSP activated, and 57.6% were from the prostate, of which 10.1% were WSP activated. WSP-activated tumors were more prevalent in metastatic sites than in primary prostate cancer. WSP-activated prostate cancer exhibited more SPOP mutations and higher expression of canonical WSP activators than WSP-WT tumors. ROR1 gene expression was elevated in WSP-activated tumors from both primary and metastatic sites. M2 macrophages predominated the tumor microenvironment in WSP-activated tumors. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients with WSP-activated and WSP-WT prostate cancer. WSP-activated prostate cancer demonstrated a more immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment and a pronounced upregulation of ROR1 gene expression, underscoring its potential involvement in the crosstalk between canonical and noncanonical WSPs. Implications: Our findings may provide a rationale for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting Wnt-activated prostate cancer."
38912901,Detecting Small Cell Transformation in Patients with Advanced EGFR Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma through Epigenomic cfDNA Profiling.,"PURPOSE: Histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a mechanism of treatment resistance in patients with advanced oncogene-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) that currently requires histologic review for diagnosis. Herein, we sought to develop an epigenomic cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based approach to noninvasively detect small cell transformation in patients with EGFR mutant (EGFRm) LUAD. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To characterize the epigenomic landscape of transformed (t)SCLC relative to LUAD and de novo SCLC, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to profile the histone modifications H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3; methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq); assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing; and RNA sequencing on 26 lung cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. We then generated and analyzed H3K27ac ChIP-seq, MeDIP-seq, and whole genome sequencing cfDNA data from 1 mL aliquots of plasma from patients with EGFRm LUAD with or without tSCLC. RESULTS: Analysis of 126 epigenomic libraries from the lung cancer PDXs revealed widespread epigenomic reprogramming between LUAD and tSCLC, with a large number of differential H3K27ac (n = 24,424), DNA methylation (n = 3,298), and chromatin accessibility (n = 16,352) sites between the two histologies. Tumor-informed analysis of each of these three epigenomic features in cfDNA resulted in accurate noninvasive discrimination between patients with EGFRm LUAD versus tSCLC [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.82-0.87]. A multianalyte cfDNA-based classifier integrating these three epigenomic features discriminated between EGFRm LUAD versus tSCLC with an AUROC of 0.94. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting small cell transformation in patients with EGFRm LUAD through epigenomic cfDNA profiling of 1 mL of patient plasma."
38909784,Androgen deprivation-induced senescence confers sensitivity to a senolytic strategy in prostate cancer.,"We have previously demonstrated that androgen-dependent prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines enter a state of senescence following exposure to androgen deprivation therapies (ADT). ADT-induced senescence was found to be transient, as senescent cells develop castration resistance and re-emerge into a proliferative state even under continuous androgen deprivation in vitro. Moreover, the BCL-X(L)/BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-263 (navitoclax), an established senolytic agent, promoted apoptosis of senescent PCa cells, suppressing proliferative recovery and subsequent tumor cell outgrowth. As this strategy has not previously been validated in vivo, we used a clinically relevant, syngeneic murine model of PCa, where mice were either castrated or castrated followed by the administration of ABT-263. Our results largely confirm the outcomes previously reported in vitro; specifically, castration alone results in a transient tumor growth suppression with characteristics of senescence, which is prolonged by exposure to ABT-263. Most critically, mice that underwent castration followed by ABT-263 experienced a statistically significant prolongation in survival, with an increase of 14.5 days in median survival time (56 days castration alone vs. 70.5 days castration + ABT-263). However, as is often the case in studies combining the promotion of senescence with a senolytic (the ""one-two"" punch approach), the suppression of tumor growth by the inclusion of the senolytic agent was transient, allowing for tumor regrowth once the drug treatment was terminated. Nevertheless, the results of this work suggest that the ""one-two"" punch senolytic strategy in PCa may effectively interfere with, diminish, or delay the development of the lethal castration-resistant phenotype."
38909779,"A peptide derived from sorting nexin 1 inhibits HPV16 entry, retrograde trafficking, and L2 membrane spanning.","High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for 99 % of cervical cancers and 5 % of all human cancers worldwide. HPV infection requires the viral genome (vDNA) to gain access to nuclei of basal keratinocytes of epithelium. After virion endocytosis, the minor capsid protein L2 dictates the subcellular retrograde trafficking and nuclear localization of the vDNA during mitosis. Prior work identified a cell-permeable peptide termed SNX1.3, derived from the BAR domain of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), that potently blocks the retrograde and nuclear trafficking of EGFR in triple negative breast cancer cells. Given the importance of EGFR and retrograde trafficking pathways in HPV16 infection, we set forth to study the effects of SNX1.3 within this context. SNX1.3 inhibited HPV16 infection by both delaying virion endocytosis, as well as potently blocking virion retrograde trafficking and Golgi localization. SNX1.3 had no effect on cell proliferation, nor did it affect post-Golgi trafficking of HPV16. Looking more directly at L2 function, SNX1.3 was found to impair membrane spanning of the minor capsid protein. Future work will focus on mechanistic studies of SNX1.3 inhibition, and the role of EGFR signaling and SNX1-mediated endosomal tubulation, cargo sorting, and retrograde trafficking in HPV infection."
38908022,HER2 overexpression in urothelial carcinoma with GATA3 and PPARG copy number gains.,"HER2, encoded by the ERBB2 gene, is an important druggable driver of human cancer gaining increasing importance as a therapeutic target in urothelial carcinoma (UC). The genomic underpinnings of HER2 overexpression in ERBB2 nonamplified UC are poorly defined. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated 172 UC tumors from patients treated at the University of California San Francisco, using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. We found that GATA3 and PPARG copy number gains individually predicted HER2 protein expression independently of ERBB2 amplification. To validate these findings, we interrogated the Memorial Sloan Kettering/The Cancer Genome Atlas (MSK/TCGA) dataset and found that GATA3 and PPARG copy number gains individually predicted ERBB2 mRNA expression independently of ERBB2 amplification. Our findings reveal a potential link between the luminal marker HER2 and the key transcription factors GATA3 and PPARG in UC and highlight the utility of examining GATA3 and PPARG copy number states to identify UC tumors that overexpress HER2 in the absence of ERBB2 amplification. In summary, we found that an increase in copy number of GATA3 and PPARG was independently associated with higher ERBB2 expression in patient samples of UC. This finding provides a potential explanation for HER2 overexpression in UC tumors without ERBB2 amplification and a way to identify these tumors for HER2-targeted therapies."
38907236,Rare histologic transformation of a CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutated prostate cancer with aggressive clinical course.,"BACKGROUND: Catenin (Cadherin-Associated Protein), Beta 1 (CTNNB1) genomic alterations are rare in prostate cancer (PCa). Gain-of-function mutations lead to overexpression of beta-catenin, with consequent hyperactivation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, implicated in PCa progression and treatment resistance. To date, successful targeted treatment options for Wnt/beta-catenin - driven PCa are lacking. METHODS: We report a rare histologic transformation of a CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutated metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), clinically characterized by highly aggressive disease course. We histologically and molecularly characterized the liver metastatic tumor samples, as well as successfully generated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a liver metastasis. We used the generated cell models for further molecular characterization and drug response assays. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of liver metastatic biopsies and PDX tumor showed lack of expression of typical PCa (e.g., AR, PSA, PSAP, ERG) or neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin), compatible with double-negative CRPC, but was positive for nuclear beta-catenin expression, keratin 7 and 34betaE12. ERG rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Drug response assays confirmed, in line with the clinical disease course, lack of sensitivity to common drugs used in mCRPC (e.g., enzalutamide, docetaxel). The casein kinase 1 (CK1) inhibitor IC261 and the tankyrase 1/2 inhibitor G700-LK showed modest activity. Moreover, despite harbouring a CTNNB1 mutation, PDOs were largely insensitive to SMARCA2/4- targeting PROTAC degraders and inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: The reported CTNNB1-mutated mCRPC case highlights the potential challenges of double-negative CRPC diagnosis and underlines the relevance of further translational research to enable successful targeted treatment of rare molecular subtypes of mCRPC."
38907210,Correlation between hemoglobin and the risk of common malignant tumors: a 1999-2020 retrospective analysis and causal association analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The role of hemoglobin (HGB) in common malignant tumors remains unclear. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to identify the correlation between HGB levels and risk of 15 malignant tumors using 50,085 samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Mendelian Randomization analyses (MRAs) were performed based on genome-wide association study data to assess the causal relationship between HGB levels and these malignant tumors using more than 700,000 samples. The robustness of the MRA results was confirmed through various analytical methods. Fifty-six in-house samples were used to investigate the correlation between HGB levels and the prognosis in prostate cancer (PRCA) using the Kaplan-Meier curve. RESULTS: High HGB levels were associated with a higher risk for patients with cervix cancer, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR > 1.000, p < 0.05). It served as a protective factor for colon cancer, esophagus cancer, stomach cancer, bone cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer, and PRCA (OR < 1.000, p < 0.05). Furthermore, MRAs suggested that elevated HGB levels were correlated with a reduced risk of PRCA (OR = 0.869, p < 0.05), with no significant association observed between this marker and the remaining 14 malignant tumors. No pleiotropy or heterogeneity was found in the ultimate results for MRAs (p-values > 0.05), suggesting the robustness of the results. The results derived from the in-house data revealed a relationship between higher HGB values and a more favorable prognosis in PRCA (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High circulating HGB levels may play a protective prognostic role for PRCA and serve as a protective factor against the occurrence of PRCA."
38906920,A Mendelian randomization study between metabolic syndrome and its components with prostate cancer.,"Previous research has produced inconsistent findings concerning the connection between metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer. It is challenging for observational studies to establish a conclusive causal relationship between the two. However, Mendelian randomization can provide stronger evidence of causality in this context. To examine the causal link between a metabolic composite and its components with prostate cancer, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing aggregated data from genome-wide association studies, followed by meta-analyses. In our study, we employed inverse variance weighting as the primary method for MR analysis. Additionally, we assessed potential sources of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy through the Cochran's Q test and MR-Egger regression. Moreover, we used multivariate MR to determine whether smoking versus alcohol consumption had an effect on the outcomes. We found no causal relationship between metabolic syndrome and its components and prostate cancer(MetS, odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.738-1.223, p = 0.691; TG, [OR] = 1.02, 95%[CI] = 0.96-1.08, p = 0.59); HDL, [OR] = 1.02, 95% [CI] = 0.97-1.07, p = 0.47; DBP, [OR] = 1.00, 95%[CI] = 0.99-1.01, p = 0.87; SBP, [OR] = 1.00, 95%[CI] = 0.99-1.00, p = 0.26; FBG [OR] = 0.92, 95%[CI] = 0.81-1.05, p = 0.23; WC, [OR] = 0.93, 95%[CI] = 0.84-1.03, p = 0.16). Finally, the MVMR confirms that the metabolic syndrome and its components are independent of smoking and alcohol consumption in prostate cancer. We didn't find significant evidence to determine a causal relationship between the metabolic syndrome and its components and prostate cancer through MR analysis. Further research is necessary to explore the potential pathogenesis between the two diseases."
38906115,2'-O-methylation at internal sites on mRNA promotes mRNA stability.,"2'-O-methylation (Nm) is a prominent RNA modification well known in noncoding RNAs and more recently also found at many mRNA internal sites. However, their function and base-resolution stoichiometry remain underexplored. Here, we investigate the transcriptome-wide effect of internal site Nm on mRNA stability. Combining nanopore sequencing with our developed machine learning method, NanoNm, we identify thousands of Nm sites on mRNAs with a single-base resolution. We observe a positive effect of FBL-mediated Nm modification on mRNA stability and expression level. Elevated FBL expression in cancer cells is associated with increased expression levels for 2'-O-methylated mRNAs of cancer pathways, implying the role of FBL in post-transcriptional regulation. Lastly, we find that FBL-mediated 2'-O-methylation connects to widespread 3' UTR shortening, a mechanism that globally increases RNA stability. Collectively, we demonstrate that FBL-mediated Nm modifications at mRNA internal sites regulate gene expression by enhancing mRNA stability."
38905345,Androgen deprivation therapy exacerbates Alzheimer's-associated cognitive decline via increased brain immune cell infiltration.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanistic connection between ADT and AD-related cognitive impairment in patients with prostate cancer remains elusive. We established a clinically relevant prostate cancer-bearing AD mouse model to explore this. Both tumor-bearing and ADT induce complex changes in immune and inflammatory responses in peripheral blood and in the brain. ADT disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and promotes immune cell infiltration into the brain, enhancing neuroinflammation and gliosis without affecting the amyloid plaque load. Moreover, treatment with natalizumab, an FDA-approved drug targeting peripheral immune cell infiltration, reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in this model. Our study uncovers an inflammatory mechanism, extending beyond amyloid pathology, that underlies ADT-exacerbated cognitive deficits, and suggests natalizumab as a potentially effective treatment in alleviating the detrimental effects of ADT on cognition."
38904040,Association between cathepsins and benign prostate diseases: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"OBJECTIVES: The relationship between cathepsins and prostate cancer (PCa) has been reported. However, there is a lack of research on cathepsins and benign prostate diseases (BPDs). This study investigated the potential genetic link between cathepsins and BPDs through the utilization of Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine if a causal relationship exists. METHODS: Publicly accessible summary statistics on BPDs were obtained from FinnGen Biobank. The data comprised 149,363 individuals, with 30,066 cases and 119,297 controls for BPH, and 123,057 individuals, with 3,760 cases and 119,297 controls for prostatitis. The IEU OpenGWAS provided the Genome-wide association data on ten cathepsins. To evaluate the causal relationship between BPDs and cathepsins, five distinct MR analyses were employed, with the primary method being the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity of the findings. RESULTS: The examination of IVW MR findings showed that cathepsin O had a beneficial effect on BPH (IVW OR=0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.98, P=0.0055), while cathepsin X posed a threat to prostatitis (IVW OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.16, P=0.047). Through reverse MR analysis, it was revealed that prostatitis had an adverse impact on cathepsin V (IVW OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99, P=0.035), while no favorable association was observed between BPH and cathepsins. The results obtained from MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods were consistent with the findings of the IVW approach. Based on sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy are unlikely to distort the results. CONCLUSION: This study offers the initial evidence of a genetic causal link between cathepsins and BPDs. Our findings revealed that cathepsin O was beneficial in preventing BPH, whereas cathepsin X posed a potential threat to prostatitis. Additionally, prostatitis negatively affected cathepsin V level. These three cathepsins could be targets of diagnosis and treatment for BPDs, which need further research."
38902353,Quality over quantity: powering neuroimaging samples in psychiatry.,"Neuroimaging has been widely adopted in psychiatric research, with hopes that these non-invasive methods will provide important clues to the underpinnings and prediction of various mental health symptoms and outcomes. However, the translational impact of neuroimaging has not yet reached its promise, despite the plethora of computational methods, tools, and datasets at our disposal. Some have lamented that too many psychiatric neuroimaging studies have been underpowered with respect to sample size. In this review, we encourage this discourse to shift from a focus on sheer increases in sample size to more thoughtful choices surrounding experimental study designs. We propose considerations at multiple decision points throughout the study design, data modeling and analysis process that may help researchers working in psychiatric neuroimaging boost power for their research questions of interest without necessarily increasing sample size. We also provide suggestions for leveraging multiple datasets to inform each other and strengthen our confidence in the generalization of findings to both population-level and clinical samples. Through a greater emphasis on improving the quality of brain-based and clinical measures rather than merely quantity, meaningful and potentially translational clinical associations with neuroimaging measures can be achieved with more modest sample sizes in psychiatry."
38901674,"Expression of L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule, a Nephronal Principal Cell Marker, in Nephrogenic Adenoma.","Nephrogenic adenoma (NA) is a benign, reactive lesion seen predominantly in the urinary bladder and often associated with antecedent inflammation, instrumentation, or an operative history. Its histopathologic diversity can create diagnostic dilemmas and pathologists use morphologic evaluation along with available immunohistochemical (IHC) markers to navigate these challenges. IHC assays currently do not designate or specify NA's potential putative cell of origin. Leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing technology, we nominated a principal (P) cell-collecting duct marker, L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), as a potential biomarker for NA. IHC characterization revealed L1CAM to be positive in all 35 (100%) patient samples of NA; negative expression was seen in the benign urothelium, benign prostatic glands, urothelial carcinoma (UCA) in situ, prostatic adenocarcinoma, majority of high-grade UCA, and metastatic UCA. In the study, we also used single-cell RNA sequencing to nominate a novel compendium of biomarkers specific for the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule (DT) (including P and intercalated cells), which can be used to perform nephronal mapping using RNA in situ hybridization and IHC technology. Employing this technique on NA we found enrichment of both the P-cell marker L1CAM and, the proximal tubule type-A and -B cell markers, PDZKI1P1 and PIGR, respectively. The cell-type markers for the intercalated cell of DTs (LINC01187 and FOXI1), and the loop of Henle (UMOD and IRX5), were found to be uniformly absent in NA. Overall, our findings show that based on cell type-specific implications of L1CAM expression, the shared expression pattern of L1CAM between DT P cells and NA. L1CAM expression will be of potential value in assisting surgical pathologists toward a diagnosis of NA in challenging patient samples."
38901247,The role of serum interleukins in Cancer: A Multi-center Mendelian Randomization study.,"The occurrence of cancer is often accompanied by immune evasion and tumor-promoting inflammation, with interleukins (IL) playing a pivotal role in the immune-inflammatory mechanism. However, the precise contribution of serum interleukins in cancer remains elusive. We obtained GWAS summary data for 35 interleukins from eight independent large-scale serum proteome studies of European ancestry populations and for 23 common cancers from the FinnGen Consortium. We then conducted a multicenter Mendelian Randomization (MR) study to explore the relationship between systemic inflammatory status and cancers. 24 causal associations between interleukins and cancers were supported by multicenter data, 18 of which were reported for the first time. Our results indicated that IL-1alpha (Hodgkin lymphoma), IL-5 (bladder cancer), IL-7 (prostate cancer), IL-11 (bone malignant tumor), IL-16 (lung cancer), IL-17A (pancreatic cancer), IL-20 (bladder cancer), IL-22 (lymphocytic leukemia), IL-34 (breast cancer), IL-36beta (prostate cancer), and IL-36gamma (liver cancer) were risk factors for related cancers. Conversely, IL-9 (malignant neoplasms of the corpus uteri), IL-17C (liver cancer), and IL-31 (colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cutaneous melanoma) exhibited protective effects against related cancers. Notably, the dual effects of serum interleukins were also observed. IL-18 acted as a risk factor for prostate cancer, however, was a protective factor against laryngeal cancer. Similarly, IL-19 promoted the development of lung cancer and myeloid leukemia, while conferring protection against Breast, cervical, and thyroid cancers. Our study confirmed the genetic association between multiple serum interleukins and cancers. Immune and anti-inflammatory strategies targeting these associations provide opportunities for prevention and treatment."
38900386,TOPK Inhibition Enhances the Sensitivity of Colorectal Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy by Reducing the DNA Damage Response.,"OBJECTIVE: Abnormal expression of T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) was reported to be closely related to the resistance of prostate cancer to radiotherapy and to targeted drug resistance in lung cancer. However, the role of TOPK inhibition in enhancing radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the radiosensitization of TOPK knockdown in CRC cells. METHODS: The expression of TOPK was detected in CRC tissues by immunohistochemistry, and the effect of TOPK knockdown was detected in CRC cells by Western blotting. CCK-8 and clonogenic assays were used to detect the growth and clonogenic ability of CRC cells after TOPK knockdown combined with radiotherapy in CRC cells. Furthermore, proteomic analysis showed that the phosphorylation of TOPK downstream proteins changed after radiotherapy. DNA damage was detected by the comet assay. Changes in the DNA damage response signaling pathway were analyzed by Western blotting, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of TOPK was significantly greater in CRC tissues at grades 2-4 than in those at grade 1. After irradiation, CRC cells with genetically silenced TOPK had shorter comet tails and reduced expression levels of DNA damage response-associated proteins, including phospho-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (p-CDK1), phospho-ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (p-ATM), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and meiotic recombination 11 homolog 1 (MRE11). CONCLUSIONS: TOPK was overexpressed in patients with moderately to poorly differentiated CRC. Moreover, TOPK knockdown significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of CRC cells by reducing the DNA damage response."

38898312,Characterization and Genome Analysis of the Delftia lacustris Strain LzhVag01 Isolated from Vaginal Discharge.,"Delftia has been separated from freshwater, sludge, and soil and has emerged as a novel opportunistic pathogen in the female vagina. However, the genomic characteristics, pathogenicity, and biotechnological properties still need to be comprehensively investigated. In this study, a Delftia strain was isolated from the vaginal discharge of a 43-year-old female with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN III), followed by whole-genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis demonstrated that it belongs to Delftia lacustris, named D. lacustris strain LzhVag01. LzhVag01 was sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, and tetracyclines but exhibited resistance to lincoamines, nitroimidazoles, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Its genome is a single, circular chromosome of 6,740,460 bp with an average GC content of 66.59%. Whole-genome analysis identified 16 antibiotic resistance-related genes, which match the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of this strain, and 11 potential virulence genes. These pathogenic factors may contribute to its colonization in the vaginal environment and its adaptation and accelerate the progression of cervical cancer. This study sequenced and characterized the whole-genome of Delftia lacustris isolated from vaginal discharge, which provides investigators and clinicians with valuable insights into this uncommon species."
38898085,Structure and transcription of integrated HPV DNA in vulvar carcinomas.,"HPV infections are associated with a fraction of vulvar cancers. Through hybridization capture and DNA sequencing, HPV DNA was detected in five of thirteen vulvar cancers. HPV16 DNA was integrated into human DNA in three of the five. The insertions were in introns of human NCKAP1, C5orf67, and LRP1B. Integrations in NCKAP1 and C5orf67 were flanked by short direct repeats in the human DNA, consistent with HPV DNA insertions at sites of abortive, staggered, endonucleolytic incisions. The insertion in C5orf67 was present as a 36 kbp, human-HPV-hetero-catemeric DNA as either an extrachromosomal circle or a tandem repeat within the human genome. The human circularization/repeat junction was defined at single nucleotide resolution. The integrated viral DNA segments all retained an intact upstream regulatory region and the adjacent viral E6 and E7 oncogenes. RNA sequencing revealed that the only HPV genes consistently transcribed from the integrated viral DNAs were E7 and E6*I. The other two HPV DNA+ tumors had coinfections, but no evidence for integration. HPV-positive and HPV-negative vulvar cancers exhibited contrasting human, global gene expression patterns partially overlapping with previously observed differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. A substantial fraction of the differentially expressed genes involved immune system function. Thus, transcription and HPV DNA integration in vulvar cancers resemble those in other HPV-positive cancers. This study emphasizes the power of hybridization capture coupled with DNA and RNA sequencing to identify a broad spectrum of HPV types, determine human genome integration status of viral DNAs, and elucidate their structures."
38898043,Disulfidptosis-related genes serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and indicate tumor microenvironment characteristics and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer.,"Disulfidptosis, a newly identified programmed cell death pathway in prostate cancer (PCa), is closely associated with intracellular disulfide stress and glycolysis. This study aims to elucidate the roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in the pathogenesis and progression of PCa, with the goal of improving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We analyzed PCa datasets and normal tissue transcriptome data from TCGA, GEO, and MSKCC. Using consensus clustering analysis and LASSO regression, we developed a risk scoring model, which was validated in an independent cohort. The model's predictive accuracy was confirmed through Kaplan-Meier curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and nomograms. Additionally, we explored the relationship between the risk score and immune cell infiltration, and examined the tumor microenvironment and somatic mutations across different risk groups. We also investigated responses to immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. Our analysis identified two disulfidosis subtypes with significant differences in survival, immune environments, and treatment responses. According to our risk score, the high-risk group exhibited poorer progression-free survival (PFS) and higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), associated with increased immune suppression. Functional enrichment analysis linked high-risk features to key cancer pathways, including the IL-17 signaling pathway. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis revealed varied responses to chemotherapy, suggesting the potential for disulfidosis-based personalized treatment strategies. Notably, we identified PROK1 as a crucial prognostic marker in PCa, with its reduced expression correlating with disease progression. In summary, our study comprehensively assessed the clinical implications of DRGs in PCa progression and prognosis, offering vital insights for tailored precision medicine approaches."
38896642,Rho GTPase activating protein 21-mediated regulation of prostate cancer associated 3 gene in prostate cancer cell.,"The overexpression of the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) gene is well-defined as a marker for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Although widely used in clinical research, PCA3 molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein we used phage display technology to identify putative molecules that bind to the promoter region of PCA3 gene and regulate its expression. The most frequent peptide PCA3p1 (80%) was similar to the Rho GTPase activating protein 21 (ARHGAP21) and its binding affinity was confirmed using Phage Bead ELISA. We showed that ARHGAP21 silencing in LNCaP prostate cancer cells decreased PCA3 and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional levels and increased prune homolog 2 (PRUNE2) coding gene expression, indicating effective involvement of ARHGAP21 in androgen-dependent tumor pathway. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the interaction between PCA3 promoter region and ARHGAP21. This is the first study that described the role of ARHGAP21 in regulating the PCA3 gene under the androgenic pathway, standing out as a new mechanism of gene regulatory control during prostatic oncogenesis."
38895460,A prostate cancer gastrointestinal transcriptional phenotype may be associated with diminished response to AR-targeted therapy.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogenous disease, but once it becomes metastatic it eventually becomes treatment resistant. One mechanism of resistance to AR-targeting therapy is lineage plasticity, where the tumor undergoes a transformation to an AR-indifferent phenotype, most studied in the context of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). However, activation of additional de- or trans-differentiation programs, including a gastrointestinal (GI) gene expression program, has been suggested as an alternative method of resistance. In this study, we explored the previously identified GI prostate cancer phenotype (PCa-GI) in a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patient biopsy samples. METHODS: We analyzed a dataset of 634 mCRPC samples with batch effect corrected gene expression data from the West Coast Dream Team (WCDT), the East Coast Dream Team (ECDT), the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and the Weill Cornell Medical center (WCM). Survival data was available from the WCDT and ECDT cohorts. We calculated a gene expression GI score using the sum of z-scores of genes from a published set of PCa-GI-defining genes (N=38). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression with endpoint overall survival from time of biopsy to death of any cause. RESULTS: We found that the PCa-GI score had a bimodal distribution, identifying a distinct set of tumors with an activated GI expression pattern. Approximately 35% of samples were classified as PCa-GI high, which was concordant with prior reports. Liver metastases had the highest median score but after excluding liver samples, 29% of the remaining samples were still classified as PCa-GI high, suggesting a distinct phenotype not exclusive to liver metastases. No correlation was observed between GI score and proliferation, AR signaling, or NEPC scores. Furthermore, the PCa-GI score was not associated with genomic alterations in AR, FOXA1, RB1, TP53 or PTEN. However, tumors with MYC amplifications showed significantly higher GI scores (p=0.0001). Patients with PCa-GI tumors had a shorter survival (HR=1.5 [1.1-2.1], p=0.02), but this result was not significant after adjusting for the liver as metastatic site (HR=1.2 [0.82-1.7], p=0.35). Patients with PCa-GI low samples had a better outcome after androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ASI, abiraterone or enzalutamide) than other therapies (HR=0.37 [0.22-0.61], p=0.0001) while the benefit of ASI was smaller and non-significant for PCa-GI high samples (HR=0.55 [0.29-1.1], p=0.07). A differential pathway analysis identified FOXA2 signaling to be upregulated PCa-GI high tumors (FDR = 3.7 x 10(-13)). CONCLUSIONS: The PCa-GI phenotype is prevalent in clinical mCRPC samples and may represent a distinct biological entity. PCa-GI tumors may respond less to ASI and could offer a strategy to study novel therapeutic targets."
38895434,Human Brain Aging is Associated with Dysregulation of Cell-Type Epigenetic Identity.,"Significant links between aging and DNA methylation are emerging from recent studies. On the one hand, DNA methylation undergoes changes with age, a process termed as epigenetic drift. On the other hand, DNA methylation serves as a readily accessible and accurate biomarker for aging. A key missing piece of information, however, is the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes, and how they are related, if any. Addressing the limitations of previous research due to the limited number of investigated CpGs and the heterogeneous nature of tissue samples, here we have examined DNA methylation of over 20 million CpGs across a broad age span in neurons and non-neuronal cells, primarily oligodendrocytes. We show that aging is a primary predictor of DNA methylation variation, surpassing the influence of factors such as sex and schizophrenia diagnosis, among others. On the genome-wide scale, epigenetic drift manifests as significant yet subtle trends that are influenced by the methylation level of individual CpGs. We reveal that CpGs that are highly differentiated between cell types are especially prone to age-associated DNA methylation alterations, leading to the divergence of epigenetic cell type identities as individuals age. On the other hand, CpGs that are included in commonly used epigenetic clocks tend to be those sites that are not highly cell type differentiated. Therefore, dysregulation of epigenetic cell-type identities and current DNA epigenetic clocks represent distinct features of age-associated DNA methylation alterations."
38895181,Longer prostate stromal cell telomere length is associated with increased risk of death from other cancers.,"BACKGROUND: Telomeres are located at chromosomal termini and function to maintain genomic integrity. Telomere dysfunction is a well-recognized contributor to aging and age-related diseases, such as prostate cancer. Since telomere length is highly heritable, we postulate that stromal cell telomere length in the tissue of a particular solid organ may generally reflect constitutive stromal cell telomere length in other solid organs throughout the body. Even with telomere loss occurring with each round of cell replication, in general, telomere length in prostate stromal cells in mid-life would still be correlated with the telomere length in stromal cells in other organs. Thus, we hypothesize that prostate stromal cell telomere length and/or telomere length variability is a potential indicator of the likelihood of developing future solid cancers, beyond prostate cancer, and especially lethal cancer. METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a cohort study analysis of 1,175 men who were surgically treated for prostate cancer and were followed for death, including from causes other than their prostate cancer. RESULTS: In this cohort study with a median follow-up of 19 years, we observed that longer prostate stromal cell telomere length measured in tissue microarray spots containing prostate cancer was associated with an increased risk of death from other solid cancers. Variability in telomere length among these prostate stromal cells was possibly positively associated with risk of death from other solid cancers. CONCLUSION: Studying the link between stromal cell telomere length and cancer mortality may be important for guiding the development of cancer interception and prevention strategies."
38893112,Metabolic Response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy of Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PC) stands as the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer and ranks as the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. For those facing non-metastatic PC necessitating intervention, solely local treatments may not suffice, leading to a possible transition toward systemic therapies, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy, and therapies targeting androgen. Yet, these systemic treatments often bring about considerable adverse effects. Additionally, it is observed that overweight men are at a higher risk of developing aggressive forms of PC, advancing to metastatic stages, and succumbing to the disease. Consequently, there is a pressing demand for new treatment options that carry fewer side effects and enhance the current standard treatments, particularly for the majority of American men who are overweight or obese. In this article, we will review the metabolic response to ADT and how lifestyle modulation can mitigate these ADT-associated metabolic responses with a particular focus on the two clinical trials, Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 1 (CAPS1) and Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2), which tested the effects of low-carbohydrate diets on the metabolic side effects of ADT and PC progression, respectively. Furthermore, we will summarize the findings of serum metabolomic studies to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which ADT and low-carbohydrate diets can affect the metabolic response to mitigate the metabolic side effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy."
38893107,Diagnostic Accuracy of DNA-Methylation in Detection of Cervical Dysplasia: Findings from a Population-Based Screening Program.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic biomarkers in cancer have emerged as promising tools for early detection, prognosis, and treatment response prediction. In cervical cells, hypermethylation of the host and viral HPV-genome increases with the severity of lesions, providing a useful biomarker in the triage of hr-HPV-positive women and during treatment. The present study focuses on evaluating the clinical performance of the FAM19A4/miR124-2 methylation test in a population-based cervical screening program. METHODS: Previously collected cervical samples, after bisulfite-converted DNA, were analyzed by PreCursor-M+ kit (distributed by Fujirebio Europe), for DNA methylation. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative/positive predictive values of DNA methylation were compared to histology, colposcopy, the HPV-DNA test, and cytology results. RESULTS: Among the 61-sample set, the specificity of methylation vs. positive histology (>/=CIN2) and colposcopy (>/=G2) were 87% and 90%, whereas the sensitivity was 50% and 33.3%, respectively. The combination of methylation analysis with standard methods increases diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found a good specificity of DNA methylation in comparison to currently used techniques. Further larger studies could support the use of FAM19A4/miR124-2 as reliable biomarkers in the prevention of cervical cancer as triage in the screening protocol."
38892296,Genomic Characterization of Preclinical Prostate Cancer Cell Line Models.,"As we move into the era of precision medicine, the growing relevance of genetic alterations to prostate cancer (PCa) development and treatment demonstrates the importance of characterizing preclinical models at the genomic level. Our study investigated the genomic characterization of eight PCa cell lines to understand which models are clinically relevant. We designed a custom AmpliSeq DNA gene panel that encompassed key molecular pathways targeting AR signaling, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and PI3K/AKT/PTEN, in addition to tumor suppressor genes. We examined the relationship between cell line genomic alterations and therapeutic response. In addition, using DepMap's Celligner tool, we identified which preclinical models are most representative of specific prostate cancer patient populations on cBioPortal. These data will help investigators understand the genetic differences in preclinical models of PCa and determine which ones are relevant for use in their translational research."
38890593,Oral pimonidazole unveils clinicopathologic and epigenetic features of hypoxic tumour aggressiveness in localized prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Tumor hypoxia is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Pimonidazole (PIMO) is an investigational hypoxia probe used in clinical trials. A better understanding of the clinical significance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia is needed for future clinical application. Here, we investigated the clinical significance and molecular alterations underpinning PIMO-labeled tumor hypoxia in patients with localized PCa, in order to apply PIMO as a prognostic tool and to identify potential biomarkers for future clinical translation. METHODS: A total of 39 patients with localized PCa were recruited and administered oral PIMO before undergoing radical prostatectomy (RadP). Immunohistochemical staining for PIMO was performed on 37 prostatectomy specimens with staining patterns evaluated and clinical association analyzed. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed using laser-capture of microdissected specimen sections comparing PIMO positive and negative tumor areas. A hypoxia related methylation molecular signature was generated by integrating the differentially methylated regions with previously established RNA-seq datasets. RESULTS: Three PIMO staining patterns were distinguished: diffuse, focal, and comedo-like. The comedo-like staining pattern was more commonly associated with adverse pathology. PIMO-defined hypoxia intensity was positively correlated with advanced pathologic stage, tumor invasion, and cribriform and intraductal carcinoma morphology. The generated DNA methylation signature was found to be a robust hypoxia biomarker, which could risk-stratify PCa patients across multiple clinical datasets, as well as be applicable in other cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: Oral PIMO unveiled clinicopathologic features of disease aggressiveness in localized PCa. The generated DNA methylation signature is a novel and robust hypoxia biomarker that has the potential for future clinical translation."
38888513,Causal role of immune cells in prostate cancer: a bidirectional Mendelian-randomization analyses.,"BACKGROUND: Immune cell signatures have been implicated in cancer progression and response to treatment. However, the causal relationship between immune cell signatures and prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential causal associations between immune cell signatures and PCa using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHOD: This study utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics for PCa and immune cell signatures from publicly available datasets. MR analyses, including IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods, were performed to evaluate the causal associations between immune cell signatures and PCa. Multiple sensitivity analysis methods have been adopted to test the robustness of our results. RESULTS: After FDR correction, our findings suggested that specific immune cell signatures, such as HLA DR on CD33+ HLA DR+ CD14dim (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.92, p = 0.006), HLA DR on CD33+ HLA DR+ CD14- (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.05-1.67, p = 0.018), and HLA DR on monocyte (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03-1.47, p = 0.021), were significantly associated with PCa. PCa had no statistically significant effect on immunophenotypes. These results remained robust in sensitivity analyses, supporting the validity of the causal associations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of a potential causal relationship between certain immune cell signatures and PCa. We observed that immune cell signatures involving HLA DR expression on specific cell types are associated with an increased risk of PCa."
38887957,Hierarchical joint analysis of marginal summary statistics-Part II: High-dimensional instrumental analysis of omics data.,"Instrumental variable (IV) analysis has been widely applied in epidemiology to infer causal relationships using observational data. Genetic variants can also be viewed as valid IVs in Mendelian randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies. However, most multivariate IV approaches cannot scale to high-throughput experimental data. Here, we leverage the flexibility of our previous work, a hierarchical model that jointly analyzes marginal summary statistics (hJAM), to a scalable framework (SHA-JAM) that can be applied to a large number of intermediates and a large number of correlated genetic variants-situations often encountered in modern experiments leveraging omic technologies. SHA-JAM aims to estimate the conditional effect for high-dimensional risk factors on an outcome by incorporating estimates from association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-intermediate or SNP-gene expression as prior information in a hierarchical model. Results from extensive simulation studies demonstrate that SHA-JAM yields a higher area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), a lower mean-squared error of the estimates, and a much faster computation speed, compared to an existing approach for similar analyses. In two applied examples for prostate cancer, we investigated metabolite and transcriptome associations, respectively, using summary statistics from a GWAS for prostate cancer with more than 140,000 men and high dimensional publicly available summary data for metabolites and transcriptomes."
38887656,"Androgen receptor, PARP signaling, and tumor microenvironment: the 'perfect triad' in prostate cancer?","Aberrations in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway in prostate cancer (PCa) provide a unique opportunity to develop therapeutic strategies that take advantage of the reduced tumor ability to repair DNA damage. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown to prolong the survival of PCa patients with HRR defects, particularly in those with Breast Cancer type 1 susceptibility protein/Breast Cancer type 2 susceptibility protein alterations. To expand the benefit of PARPi to patients without detectable HRR alterations, multiple preclinical and clinical studies are addressing potential synergies between PARPi and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, and these strategies are also being evaluated in combination with other drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the effectiveness of these combining therapies could be hindered by multiple mechanisms of resistance, including also the role played by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this review, we summarize the use of PARPi in PCa and the potential synergies with different molecular pathways. However, numerous unanswered questions remain, including the identification of the patient population that could benefit most from PARPi, determining whether to use PARPi as monotherapy or in combination, and finding the optimal timing of PARPi, expanding the use of genomic tests, and optimizing combination therapies."
38886572,Tumor suppressor Par-4 activates autophagy-dependent ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis is a unique iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by devastating lipid peroxidation. Whilst growing evidence suggests that ferroptosis is a type of autophagy-dependent cell death, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating ferroptosis are largely unknown. In this study, through an unbiased RNA-sequencing screening, we demonstrate the activation of a multi-faceted tumor-suppressor protein Par-4/PAWR during ferroptosis. Functional studies reveal that genetic depletion of Par-4 effectively blocks ferroptosis, whereas Par-4 overexpression sensitizes cells to undergo ferroptosis. More importantly, we have determined that Par-4-triggered ferroptosis is mechanistically driven by the autophagic machinery. Upregulation of Par-4 promotes activation of ferritinophagy (autophagic degradation of ferritin) via the nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4), resulting in excessive release of free labile iron and, hence, enhanced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Inhibition of Par-4 dramatically suppresses the NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy signaling axis. Our results also establish that Par-4 activation positively correlates with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is critical for ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis. Furthermore, Par-4 knockdown effectively blocked ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression in the mouse xenograft models. Collectively, these findings reveal that Par-4 has a crucial role in ferroptosis, which could be further exploited for cancer therapy."
38883596,Cathepsins and cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous observational epidemiological studies reported an association between cathepsins and cancer, however, a causal relationship is uncertain. This study evaluated the causal relationship between cathepsins and cancer using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: We used publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for bidirectional MR analysis. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary MR method of MR analysis. RESULTS: After correction for the False Discovery Rate (FDR), two cathepsins were found to be significantly associated with cancer risk: cathepsin H (CTSH) levels increased the risk of lung cancer (OR = 1.070, 95% CI = 1.027-1.114, P = 0.001, P(FDR) = 0.009), and CTSH levels decreased the risk of basal cell carcinoma (OR = 0.947, 95% CI = 0.919-0.975, P = 0.0002, P (FDR) = 0.002). In addition, there was no statistically significant effect of the 20 cancers on the nine cathepsins. Some unadjusted low P-value phenotypes are worth mentioning, including a positive correlation between cathepsin O (CTSO) and breast cancer (OR = 1.012, 95% CI = 1.001-1.025, P = 0.041), cathepsin S (CTSS) and pharyngeal cancer (OR = 1.017, 95% CI = 1.001-1.034, P = 0.043), and CTSS and endometrial cancer (OR = 1.055, 95% CI = 1.012-1.101, P = 0.012); and there was a negative correlation between cathepsin Z and ovarian cancer (CTSZ) (OR = 0.970, 95% CI = 0.949-0.991, P = 0.006), CTSS and prostate cancer (OR = 0.947, 95% CI = 0.902-0.944, P = 0.028), and cathepsin E (CTSE) and pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.963, 95% CI = 0.938-0.990, P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our MR analyses showed a causal relationship between cathepsins and cancers and may help provide new insights for further mechanistic and clinical studies of cathepsin-mediated cancer."
38882441,PARP inhibitors in non-ovarian gynecologic cancers.,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) have transformed the treatment of ovarian cancer, particularly benefiting patients whose tumors harbor genomic events that result in impaired homologous recombination (HR) repair. The use of PARPi over recent years has expanded to include subpopulations of patients with breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Their potential to benefit patients with non-ovarian gynecologic cancers is being recognized. This review examines the underlying biological rationale for exploring PARPi in non-ovarian gynecologic cancers. We consider the clinical data and place this in the context of the current treatment landscape. We review the development of PARPi strategies for treating patients with endometrial, cervical, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and vulvar cancers. Furthermore, we discuss future directions and the importance of understanding HR deficiency in the context of each cancer type."
38881936,Unveiling the role of HACE1 in cervical cancer: implications for human papillomavirus infection and prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer, one of the prevalent malignancies among females, is closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 1 (HACE1) plays pivotal roles in various cancers. This study aimed to elucidate the expression of HACE1 in cervical cancer and its correlation with clinical features. METHODS: From The Cancer Genome Atlas Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, GSE6791) datasets, we obtained RNA-Seq profiles and associated clinical information. Differential gene analysis was conducted using the R ""limma"" package. Implications for HPV infection and the overall survival (OS) of cervical cancer were determined by performing differential expression analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Immunohistochemical analyses were used to validate the expression in cervical cancer and normal cervical tissue. Further, nomogram was constructed to predict OS in cervical cancer. Whether the model was credible was evaluated according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance curves. To further evaluate the potential functions of HACE1, we conducted functional enrichment analysis. Finally, we assessed methylation levels in HPV+ and HPV- patients in the TCGA-CESC dataset. RESULTS: Utilizing TCGA and GSE6791 datasets, we observed significant upregulation of HACE1 in cervical cancer patients, particularly linked to HPV infection. Immunohistochemical staining revealed enhanced HACE1 expression in tumor tissues. Further analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between elevated HACE1 and HPV-associated proteins (E1, E6, and E7). Moreover, high HACE1 expression was associated with adverse prognosis in cervical cancer patients. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that HACE1 could serve as an independent prognostic factor. We developed a prognostic model integrating HPV subtypes, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, and HACE1, exhibiting strong predictive efficacy for cervical cancer prognosis. Gene enrichment analysis indicated HACE1's potential involvement in multiple signaling pathways during cervical cancer progression, while the demethylation of cg03002526 in HPV-positive patients might contribute to HACE1 upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that HACE1 upregulation is associated with cervical cancer, particularly in HPV-positive patients. HACE1 emerges as an independent prognostic factor, linked to unfavorable outcomes."
38881031,A Review: Genetic Mutations as a Key to Unlocking Drug Resistance in Cervical Cancer.,"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women. Advanced stage and metastatic disease are often associated with poor clinical outcomes. This substantiates the absolute necessity for high-throughput diagnostic and treatment platforms that are patient and tumour specific. Cervical cancer treatment constitutes multimodal intervention. Systemic treatments such as chemotherapy and/or focal radiotherapy are typically applied as neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant strategies. Cisplatin constitutes an integral part of standard cervical cancer treatment approaches. However, despite initial patient response, de novo or delayed/acquired treatment resistance is often reported, and toxicity is of concern. Chemotherapy resistance is associated with major alterations in genomic, metabolomic, epigenetic and proteomic landscapes. This results in imbalanced homeostasis associated with pro-oncogenic and proliferative survival, anti-apoptotic benefits, and enhanced DNA damage repair processes. Although significant developments in cancer diagnoses and treatment have been made over the last two decades, drug resistance remains a major obstacle to overcome."
38881003,[Amplifiation of the c-MYC gene in acinar prostate adenocarcinoma. Morphogenic comparisons].,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate c-MYC gene amplification in the substrate of prostate acinar adenocarcinoma at various Gleason scores and various stages of the disease, taking into account the morphological characteristics of the tumor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of cases in the study was 82, including the control group - 12 cases. Morphological assessment included: determination of the total Gleason score, grading group, assessment of lymphovascular/perineural invasion, and architectural characteristics of the tumor. Gene amplification was assessed by FISH using the c-MYC (8q24)/SE8 probe. RESULTS: In all cases of the study group, amplification of the c-MYC gene was detected in the tumor, with a significant difference from the control group (p<0.05). When assessing cases with 4-6 fold copies of the gene, significant differences were established between patients with stages II and III of the disease and stage IV (10.0 and 13.5 versus 30.0) (p<0.05). Cluster amplification of the c-MYC gene was detected with equal frequency in groups of patients with stages III and IV of the disease, while in stage II of the disease, the event almost did not occur (p<0.05). A significant increase in the level of c-MYC gene amplification was found in groups with advanced stages of the disease (p<0.02). Non-cluster amplification significantly distinguishes T4M0 and T4M1 stage patients from the rest with a significant increase in the score (p<0.05). In the metastatic stage of the disease, there was an increase c-MYC gene amplification compared to the non-metastatic stage (p<0.02). The copy number of the c-MYC gene was significantly higher in cases with perineural and lymphovascular invasion, as well as in cases of cribriform tumor organization (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Amplification of the c-MYC gene in prostate tumor cells is associated with advanced stages of the disease (T4M0 and T4M1) with an increase in the copy number of the gene during the metastatic stage of the process. It was found that increased amplification of the c-MYC gene distinguishes groups of patients whose tumors exhibit perineural and lymphovascular invasion, as well as a cribriform pattern of tumor organization."
38878775,Integrated single-cell analysis defines the epigenetic basis of castration-resistant prostate luminal cells.,"Understanding prostate response to castration and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) is critical to improving long-term prostate cancer (PCa) patient survival. Here, we use a multi-omics approach on 229,794 single cells to create a mouse single-cell reference atlas for interpreting mouse prostate biology and castration response. Our reference atlas refines single-cell annotations and provides a chromatin context, which, when coupled with mouse lineage tracing, demonstrates that castration-resistant luminal cells are distinct from the pre-existent urethra-proximal stem/progenitor cells. Molecular pathway analysis and therapeutic studies further implicate AP1 (JUN/FOS), WNT/beta-catenin, FOXQ1, NF-kappaB, and JAK/STAT pathways as major drivers of castration-resistant luminal populations with relevance to human PCa. Our datasets, which can be explored through an interactive portal (https://visportal.roswellpark.org/data/tang/), can aid in developing combination treatments with ARSI for advanced PCa patients."
38878676,"Identifying proteomic risk factors for overall, aggressive, and early onset prostate cancer using Mendelian Randomisation and tumour spatial transcriptomics.","BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of circulating proteins in prostate cancer risk can reveal key biological pathways and identify novel targets for cancer prevention. METHODS: We investigated the association of 2002 genetically predicted circulating protein levels with risk of prostate cancer overall, and of aggressive and early onset disease, using cis-pQTL Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalisation. Findings for proteins with support from both MR, after correction for multiple-testing, and colocalisation were replicated using two independent cancer GWAS, one of European and one of African ancestry. Proteins with evidence of prostate-specific tissue expression were additionally investigated using spatial transcriptomic data in prostate tumour tissue to assess their role in tumour aggressiveness. Finally, we mapped risk proteins to drug and ongoing clinical trials targets. FINDINGS: We identified 20 proteins genetically linked to prostate cancer risk (14 for overall [8 specific], 7 for aggressive [3 specific], and 8 for early onset disease [2 specific]), of which the majority replicated where data were available. Among these were proteins associated with aggressive disease, such as PPA2 [Odds Ratio (OR) per 1 SD increment = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.54-2.93], PYY [OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.43-2.44] and PRSS3 [OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.89], and those associated with early onset disease, including EHPB1 [OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.99-4.21], POGLUT3 [OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.86] and TPM3 [OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64]. We confirmed an inverse association of MSMB with prostate cancer overall [OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.82], and also found an inverse association with both aggressive [OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.82-0.86] and early onset disease [OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.68-0.74]. Using spatial transcriptomics data, we identified MSMB as the genome-wide top-most predictive gene to distinguish benign regions from high grade cancer regions that comparatively had five-fold lower MSMB expression. Additionally, ten proteins that were associated with prostate cancer risk also mapped to existing therapeutic interventions. INTERPRETATION: Our findings emphasise the importance of proteomics for improving our understanding of prostate cancer aetiology and of opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we demonstrate the added benefit of in-depth functional analyses to triangulate the role of risk proteins in the clinical aggressiveness of prostate tumours. Using these integrated methods, we identify a subset of risk proteins associated with aggressive and early onset disease as priorities for investigation for the future prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

38877389,The vaginal microbial signatures of preterm birth woman.,"To explore the differences of vaginal microbes in women with preterm birth (PTB), and to construct prediction model. We searched for articles related to vaginal microbiology in preterm women and obtained four 16S rRNA-sequence datasets. We analyzed that for species diversity and differences, and constructed a random forest model with 20 differential genera. We introduce an independent whole genome-sequencing (WGS) data for validation. In addition, we collected vaginal and cervical swabs from 33 pregnant women who delivered spontaneously full-term and preterm infants, performed WGS in our lab to further validate the model. Compared to term birth (TB) samples, PTB women vagina were characterized by a decrease in Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, and an increase in diversity accompanied by the colonization of pathogenic bacteria such as Gardnerella, Atopobium and Prevotella. Twenty genus markers, including Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Gardnerella performed well in predicting PTB, with study-to-study transfer validation and LODO validation, different gestation validation showing good results, and in two independent cohorts (external WGS cohorts and woman samples WGS cohorts) in which the accuracy was maintained. PTB women have unique vaginal microbiota characteristics. A predictive model of PTB was constructed and its value validated from multiple perspectives."
38877335,Brucine Suppresses Malignant Progression of Prostate Cancer by Decreasing Sarcosine Accumulation via Downregulation of GNMT in the Glycine/sarcosine Metabolic Pathway.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related incidence and mortality in men. Disruptions in amino acid (AA) metabolism contribute to the disease progression, with brucine, a glycine antagonist, exhibiting antitumor effects. This study explores the antitumor impact of brucine on PCa and investigates its mechanisms in regulating AA metabolic pathways. The study employed the PCa cell line DU-145, characterized by high sarcosine (Sar) levels, for various assays including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), wound healing, Transwell, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU), TdT mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL), flow cytometry, Western blot, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Network pharmacological analysis determined the anticancer mechanisms of brucine. Sar levels in DU-145 cells were significantly higher than in normal prostatic epithelial cells RWPE-1. Treatment with brucine resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration, while promoting apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Sar levels decreased with increasing brucine concentration. Network pharmacology analysis linked brucine's anticancer effect to the AA metabolism and glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) pathways. GNMT expression in prostate cancer tissues and The Cancer Genome Atlas database was significantly elevated compared to controls. Treatment with brucine led to downregulation of GNMT expression in DU-145 cells without significant effect on sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH). Addition of recombinant GNMT partially reversed the inhibitory effects of brucine on DU-145 cells. Treatment with brucine downregulates GNMT expression in DU-145 cells, reducing Sar accumulation and inhibiting tumor progression. These findings provide new insights into the antitumor mechanisms of brucine in PCa."
38875382,Study on the mechanism of inhibition of Escherichia coli by Polygonum capitatum based on network pharmacology and molecular docking technology: A review.,"This study aims to analyze the effective components of Polygonum capitatum (PC) inhibiting Escherichia coli based on network pharmacology methods and predict its molecular mechanism of action. PC compounds and targets were collected from the TCMSP database, Swiss Target Prediction, and the literature. E coli targets were searched using the GeneCards database. The targets of E coli and the targets of the active ingredients of PC were taken as intersections to obtain the intersecting targets. The resulting overlapping targets were uploaded to the STRING database to construct the protein interaction network diagram of E coli target inhibition. The key targets for the inhibitory effect of PC on E coli were obtained. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed by uploading key targets into the DAVID database. The results showed that there were 50 targets for PC to inhibit E coli. Among them, there are 5 core targets, mainly including AKT1, TNF, EGFR, JUN, and ESR1. A total of 196 gene ontology functional analysis results and 126 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis results were obtained. These include cellular response to cadmium-ion, cellular response to reactive oxygen species, pathways in cancer, prostate cancer, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Molecular docking results indicate that Lutedin, Hirsutin, Flazin, and Ellagic acid in PC have high affinity for the target genes AKT1, TNF, MAPK3 and EGFR. PC exerts its inhibitory effect on E coli through multi-targets and multi-pathways, which provides a new basis for the new use of PC as an old medicine."
38874922,Development of a Longitudinal Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic and Clinical Data Linkage.,"IMPORTANCE: Although tissue-based gene expression testing has become widely used for prostate cancer risk stratification, its prognostic performance in the setting of clinical care is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To develop a linkage between a prostate genomic classifier (GC) and clinical data across payers and sites of care in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, clinical and transcriptomic data from clinical use of a prostate GC between 2016 and 2022 were linked with data aggregated from insurance claims, pharmacy records, and electronic health record (EHR) data. Participants were anonymously linked between datasets by deterministic methods through a deidentification engine using encrypted tokens. Algorithms were developed and refined for identifying prostate cancer diagnoses, treatment timing, and clinical outcomes using diagnosis codes, Common Procedural Terminology codes, pharmacy codes, Systematized Medical Nomenclature for Medicine clinical terms, and unstructured text in the EHR. Data analysis was performed from January 2023 to January 2024. EXPOSURE: Diagnosis of prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were biochemical recurrence and development of prostate cancer metastases after diagnosis or radical prostatectomy (RP). The sensitivity of the linkage and identification algorithms for clinical and administrative data were calculated relative to clinical and pathological information obtained during the GC testing process as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 92 976 of 95 578 (97.2%) participants who underwent prostate GC testing were successfully linked to administrative and clinical data, including 53 871 who underwent biopsy testing and 39 105 who underwent RP testing. The median (IQR) age at GC testing was 66.4 (61.0-71.0) years. The sensitivity of the EHR linkage data for prostate cancer diagnoses was 85.0% (95% CI, 84.7%-85.2%), including 80.8% (95% CI, 80.4%-81.1%) for biopsy-tested participants and 90.8% (95% CI, 90.5%-91.0%) for RP-tested participants. Year of treatment was concordant in 97.9% (95% CI, 97.7%-98.1%) of those undergoing GC testing at RP, and 86.0% (95% CI, 85.6%-86.4%) among participants undergoing biopsy testing. The sensitivity of the linkage was 48.6% (95% CI, 48.1%-49.1%) for identifying RP and 50.1% (95% CI, 49.7%-50.5%) for identifying prostate biopsy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study established a national-scale linkage of transcriptomic and longitudinal clinical data yielding high accuracy for identifying key clinical junctures, including diagnosis, treatment, and early cancer outcome. This resource can be leveraged to enhance understandings of disease biology, patterns of care, and treatment effectiveness."
38874503,Genetically predicted 91 circulating inflammatory proteins in relation to risk of urological malignancies: a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Urological malignancies, including kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer, are major health concerns worldwide. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these cancers, and circulating inflammatory proteins may play a role in their development. However, the causal relationship between specific plasma proteins and urological malignancies remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Instrumental variables representing genetic variants associated with circulating inflammatory proteins were used to infer causality on the risk of kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer. Four MR methods were utilized to provide robust effect estimates. RESULTS: Our analysis identified several plasma proteins associated with a lower risk of kidney and bladder cancer, including Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, Caspase 8, Natural killer cell receptor 2B4, and Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12. However, after adjusting for multiple testing, these associations did not remain statistically significant. For prostate cancer, CUB domain-containing protein 1 and Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta were found to be protective, while Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and SIR2-like protein 2 were identified as risk factors. After FDR adjustment, none of the inflammatory proteins were found to be significantly associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that certain plasma proteins may be involved in the development of urological malignancies. Mendelian randomization provides a useful framework for investigating causal relationships between inflammatory proteins and urological cancers, offering potential insights into their underlying biology and therapeutic targets."
38872215,Developing an optimal stratification model for colorectal cancer screening and reducing racial disparities in multi-center population-based studies.,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of colorectal neoplasms can reduce the colorectal cancer (CRC) burden by timely intervention for high-risk individuals. However, effective risk prediction models are lacking for personalized CRC early screening in East Asian (EAS) population. We aimed to develop, validate, and optimize a comprehensive risk prediction model across all stages of the dynamic adenoma-carcinoma sequence in EAS population. METHODS: To develop precision risk-stratification and intervention strategies, we developed three trans-ancestry PRSs targeting colorectal neoplasms: (1) using 148 previously identified CRC risk loci (PRS(148)); (2) SNPs selection from large-scale meta-analysis data by clumping and thresholding (PRS(183)); (3) PRS-CSx, a Bayesian approach for genome-wide risk prediction (PRS(Genomewide)). Then, the performance of each PRS was assessed and validated in two independent cross-sectional screening sets, including 4600 patients with advanced colorectal neoplasm, 4495 patients with non-advanced adenoma, and 21,199 normal individuals from the ZJCRC (Zhejiang colorectal cancer set; EAS) and PLCO (the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; European, EUR) studies. The optimal PRS was further incorporated with lifestyle factors to stratify individual risk and ultimately tested in the PLCO and UK Biobank prospective cohorts, totaling 350,013 participants. RESULTS: Three trans-ancestry PRSs achieved moderately improved predictive performance in EAS compared to EUR populations. Remarkably, the PRSs effectively facilitated a thorough risk assessment across all stages of the dynamic adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Among these models, PRS(183) demonstrated the optimal discriminatory ability in both EAS and EUR validation datasets, particularly for individuals at risk of colorectal neoplasms. Using two large-scale and independent prospective cohorts, we further confirmed a significant dose-response effect of PRS(183) on incident colorectal neoplasms. Incorporating PRS(183) with lifestyle factors into a comprehensive strategy improves risk stratification and discriminatory accuracy compared to using PRS or lifestyle factors separately. This comprehensive risk-stratified model shows potential in addressing missed diagnoses in screening tests (best NPV = 0.93), while moderately reducing unnecessary screening (best PPV = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive risk-stratified model in population-based CRC screening trials represents a promising advancement in personalized risk assessment, facilitating tailored CRC screening in the EAS population. This approach enhances the transferability of PRSs across ancestries and thereby helps address health disparity."
38871824,Integrative analysis of ultra-deep RNA-seq reveals alternative promoter usage as a mechanism of activating oncogenic programmes during prostate cancer progression.,"Transcription factor (TF) proteins regulate gene activity by binding to regulatory regions, most importantly at gene promoters. Many genes have alternative promoters (APs) bound by distinct TFs. The role of differential TF activity at APs during tumour development is poorly understood. Here we show, using deep RNA sequencing in 274 biopsies of benign prostate tissue, localized prostate tumours and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, that AP usage increases as tumours progress and APs are responsible for a disproportionate amount of tumour transcriptional activity. Expression of the androgen receptor (AR), the key driver of prostate tumour activity, is correlated with elevated AP usage. We identified AR, FOXA1 and MYC as potential drivers of AP activation. DNA methylation is a likely mechanism for AP activation during tumour progression and lineage plasticity. Our data suggest that prostate tumours activate APs to magnify the transcriptional impact of tumour drivers, including AR and MYC."
38871730,Prostate cancer reshapes the secreted and extracellular vesicle urinary proteomes.,"Urine is a complex biofluid that reflects both overall physiologic state and the state of the genitourinary tissues through which it passes. It contains both secreted proteins and proteins encapsulated in tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). To understand the population variability and clinical utility of urine, we quantified the secreted and EV proteomes from 190 men, including a subset with prostate cancer. We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions and can risk-stratify prostate tumors. This resource quantifies the complexity of the urinary proteome and reveals the synergistic value of secreted and EV proteomes for translational and biomarker studies."
38871684,Genomic characterization of cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma following the Chornobyl accident.,"Childhood radioactive iodine exposure from the Chornobyl accident increased papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) risk. While cervical lymph node metastases (cLNM) are well-recognized in pediatric PTC, the PTC metastatic process and potential radiation association are poorly understood. Here, we analyze cLNM occurrence among 428 PTC with genomic landscape analyses and known drivers ((131)I-exposed = 349, unexposed = 79; mean age = 27.9 years). We show that cLNM are more frequent in PTC with fusion (55%) versus mutation (30%) drivers, although the proportion varies by specific driver gene (RET-fusion = 71%, BRAF-mutation = 38%, RAS-mutation = 5%). cLNM frequency is not associated with other characteristics, including radiation dose. cLNM molecular profiling (N = 47) demonstrates 100% driver concordance with matched primary PTCs and highly concordant mutational spectra. Transcriptome analysis reveals 17 differentially expressed genes, particularly in the HOXC cluster and BRINP3; the strongest differentially expressed microRNA also is near HOXC10. Our findings underscore the critical role of driver alterations and provide promising candidates for elucidating the biological underpinnings of PTC cLNM."
38871390,Interreader and Intrareader Reproducibility of (18)F-Flotufolastat Image Interpretation in Patients with Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Data from Two Phase 3 Prospective Multicenter Studies.,"Interreader and intrareader reproducibility of (18)F-flotufolastat PET/CT scans in newly diagnosed and recurrent prostate cancer patients was assessed from masked image evaluations from two phase 3 studies. Methods: (18)F-flotufolastat PET/CT images of newly diagnosed (n = 352) or recurrent (n = 389) patients were evaluated by 3 masked readers. Cohen kappa was used to assess pairwise patient- and region-level interreader agreement. Agreement among all readers was assessed using Fleiss kappa. Intrareader agreement between the first and repeat read (20% of images, >/=4 wk later) was assessed using Cohen kappa. Results: Pairwise interreader agreement was 95% or better (newly diagnosed) and 75% or better (recurrent). The kappa coefficients were impacted by the high-agreement-low-kappa paradox: Cohen kappa ranged from not estimable to 0.55, whereas Fleiss kappa was 0.50 (newly diagnosed) and 0.41 (recurrent). Agreement was highest in the prostate of newly diagnosed patients (>/=95%) and in the pelvic lymph nodes in recurrent patients (>/=87%). Intrareader agreement was 86% or better across both populations. Conclusion: (18)F-flotufolastat PET/CT images can be reliably interpreted, with a high degree of inter- and intrareader agreement."
38870985,Construction and Validation of a Prognostic Model Based on Mitochondrial Genes in Prostate Cancer.,"This study attempted to build a prostate cancer (PC) prognostic risk model with mitochondrial feature genes. PC-related MTGs were screened for Cox regression analyses, followed by establishing a prognostic model. Model validity was analyzed via survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and model accuracy was validated in the GEO dataset. Combining risk score with clinical factors, the independence of the risk score was verified by using Cox analysis, followed by generating a nomogram. The Gleason score, microsatellite instability (MSI), immune microenvironment, and tumor mutation burden were analyzed in two risk groups. Finally, the prognostic feature genes were verified through a q-PCR test. Ten PC-associated MTGs were screened, and a prognostic model was built. Survival analysis and ROC curves illustrated that the model was a good predictor for the risk of PC. Cox regression analysis revealed that risk score acted as an independent prognostic factor. The Gleason score and MSI in the high-risk group were substantially higher than in the low-risk group. Levels of ESTIMATE Score, Immune Score, Stromal Score, immune cells, immune function, immune checkpoint, and immunopheno score of partial immune checkpoints in the high-risk group were significantly lower than in the low-risk group. Genes with the highest mutation frequencies in the two groups were SPOP, TTN, and TP53. The q-PCR results of the feature genes were consistent with the gene expression results in the database. The 10-gene model based on MTGs could accurately predict the prognosis of PC patients and their responses to immunotherapy."
38870367,Study of the genomics and transcriptomics profiles of male-infertility genes in human prostate cancer: an in silico analysis.,"The World Health Organization has considered the infertility as an international public health problem. Infertility affect nearly 1 in 7 couples and male component contributes to 50% of infertility cases. There is a clear link between male infertility and some cancers such as testicular germ cell, prostate and colon cancers. Two possibilities support this finding: 1) Cancer treatments can affect the fertility factors 2) Genetic profile of infertility genes have been altered in cancer patients. Although the previously published researches have mostly focused on the first factor, no article has yet confirmed the role of genetic factors. In this in silico study, we collected the large number of genes (n = 17703) involved in infertility. These genes were collected from NGS panel tests of male infertility and comprehensive literature review or online data base. The Prostate Adenocarcinoma genomic and transcriptomics raw data were downloaded from the cBioPortal Cancer dataset. This included with 494 patients of Prostate Cancer with 494 mutation data, 489 with CNA and 493 with RNA seqV2 data. TCGA RNA-Seq raw data was extracted in R using the cgdsr extension package with a threshold of +/-2 relative to normal samples. The observed data showed that male infertility genes have been distributed through the human genome. Among the 17703 analyzed genes of this study, the genomic profile of three genes including OR9Q1, H4C6 and PSG7 were changed approximately in 100% of (n = 493) patients. In most of patients (>98%), genetic alteration was related to change in gene expression. In conclusion, this study showed that the genomic and transcriptomics patterns of some male-infertility genes are notably altered in patients of prostate cancer and suggested a possible role of genetic factors in occurrence of infertility in cancer patients. Our information can be used as a source for the design of genetic database of male-infertility."
38870176,Glyoxalase 1: Emerging biomarker and therapeutic target in cervical cancer progression.,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer presents a significant global health challenge, disproportionately impacting underserved populations with limited access to healthcare. Early detection and effective management are vital in addressing this public health concern. This study focuses on Glyoxalase-1 (GLO1), an enzyme crucial for methylglyoxal detoxification, in the context of cervical cancer. METHODS: We assessed GLO1 expression in cervical cancer patient samples using immunohistochemistry. In vitro experiments using HeLa cells were conducted to evaluate the impact of GLO1 inhibition on cell viability and migration. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and gene set variation analysis were utilized to investigate the role of GLO1 in the metabolism of cervical cancer. Additionally, public microarray data were analyzed to determine GLO1 expression across various stages of cervical cancer. RESULTS: Our analysis included 58 cervical cancer patients, and showed that GLO1 is significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal cervical tissues, independent of pathological findings and disease stage. In vitro experiments indicated that GLO1 inhibition by S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester decreased cell viability and migration in cervical cancer cell lines. Analyses of scRNA-seq data and public gene expression datasets corroborated the overexpression of GLO1 and its involvement in cancer metabolism, particularly glycolysis. An examination of expression data from precancerous lesions revealed a progressive increase in GLO1 expression from normal tissue to invasive cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of GLO1 in the progression of cervical cancer, presenting it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings contribute valuable insights towards personalized treatment approaches and augment the ongoing efforts to combat cervical cancer. Further research is necessary to comprehensively explore GLO1's potential in clinical applications."
38869692,Genomics in active surveillance and post-prostatectomy patients: A review of when and how to use effectively.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prostate cancer (PCa) represents a significant health burden globally, ranking as the most diagnosed cancer among men and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Conventional treatment methods such as radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy have significant side effects which often impact quality of life. As our understanding of the natural history and progression of PCa has evolved, so has the evolution of management options. RECENT FINDINGS: Active surveillance (AS) has become an increasingly favored approach to the management of very low, low, and properly selected favorable intermediate risk PCa. AS permits ongoing observation and postpones intervention until definitive treatment is required. There are, however, challenges with selecting patients for AS, which further emphasizes the need for more precise tools to better risk stratify patients and choose candidates more accurately. Tissue-based biomarkers, such as ProMark, Prolaris, GPS (formerly Oncotype DX), and Decipher, are valuable because they improve the accuracy of patient selection for AS and offer important information on the prognosis and severity of disease. By enabling patients to be categorized according to their risk profiles, these biomarkers help physicians and patients make better informed treatment choices and lower the possibility of overtreatment. Even with their potential, further standardization and validation of these biomarkers is required to guarantee their broad clinical utility. Active surveillance has emerged as a preferred strategy for managing low-risk prostate cancer, and tissue-based biomarkers play a crucial role in refining patient selection and risk stratification. Standardization and validation of these biomarkers are essential to ensure their widespread clinical use and optimize patient outcomes."
38869181,Intracellular Osteopontin Promotes the Release of TNFalpha by Mast Cells to Restrain Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive form of prostate cancer that emerges as tumors become resistant to hormone therapies or, rarely, arises de novo in treatment-naive patients. The urgent need for effective therapies against NEPC is hampered by the limited knowledge of the biology governing this lethal disease. Based on our prior observations in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) spontaneous prostate cancer model, in which the genetic depletion of either mast cells (MC) or the matricellular protein osteopontin (OPN) increases NEPC frequency, we tested the hypothesis that MCs can restrain NEPC through OPN production, using in vitro co-cultures between murine or human tumor cell lines and MCs, and in vivo experiments. We unveiled a role for the intracellular isoform of OPN, so far neglected compared with the secreted isoform. Mechanistically, we unraveled that the intracellular isoform of OPN promotes TNFalpha production in MCs via the TLR2/TLR4-MyD88 axis, specifically triggered by the encounter with NEPC cells. We found that MC-derived TNFalpha, in turn, hampered the growth of NEPC. We then identified the protein syndecan-1 (SDC1) as the NEPC-specific TLR2/TLR4 ligand that triggered this pathway. Interrogating published single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we validated this mechanism in a different mouse model. Translational relevance of the results was provided by in silico analyses of available human NEPC datasets and by immunofluorescence on patient-derived adenocarcinoma and NEPC lesions. Overall, our results show that MCs actively inhibit NEPC, paving the way for innovative MC-based therapies for this fatal tumor. We also highlight SDC1 as a potential biomarker for incipient NEPC."
38867724,Insulin-related traits and prostate cancer: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Investigating the causal relationship between insulin secretion and prostate cancer (PCa) development is challenging due to the multifactorial nature of PCa, which complicates the isolation of the specific impact of insulin-related factors. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the associations between insulin secretion-related traits and PCa. We used 36, 60, 56, 23, 48, and 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables for fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity, proinsulin, and proinsulin in nondiabetic individuals, individuals with diabetes, and individuals receiving exogenous insulin, respectively. These SNPs were selected from various genome-wide association studies. To clarify the causal relationship between insulin-related traits and PCa, we utilized a multivariable MR analysis to adjust for obesity and body fat percentage. Additionally, two-step Mendelian randomization was conducted to assess the role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the relationship between proinsulin and PCa. Two-sample MR analysis revealed strong associations between genetically predicted fasting insulin, insulin sensitivity, proinsulin, and proinsulin in nondiabetic individuals and the development of PCa. After adjustment for obesity and body fat percentage using multivariable MR analysis, proinsulin remained significantly associated with PCa, whereas other factors were not. Furthermore, two-step MR analysis demonstrated that proinsulin acts as a negative factor in prostate carcinogenesis, largely independent of IGF-1. This study provides evidence suggesting that proinsulin may act as a negative factor contributing to the development of PCa. Novel therapies targeting proinsulin may have potential benefits for PCa patients, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary surgical treatments."

38863374,Predicting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Urine Metabolomics via Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry.,"PURPOSE: Biomarkers predicting clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC) before biopsy are currently lacking. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive urine test to predict sPC in at-risk men using urinary metabolomic profiles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine samples from 934 at-risk subjects and 268 treatment-naive PC patients were subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics profiling using both C18 and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column analyses. Four models were constructed (training cohort [n=647]) and validated (validation cohort [n=344]) for different purposes. Model I differentiates PC from benign cases. Models II, III, and a Gleason score model (model GS) predict sPC that is defined as National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-categorized favorable-intermediate risk group or higher (Model II), unfavorable-intermediate risk group or higher (Model III), and GS >/=7 PC (model GS), respectively. The metabolomic panels and predicting models were constructed using logistic regression and Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: The best metabolomic panels from the HILIC column include 25, 27, 28 and 26 metabolites in Models I, II, III, and GS, respectively, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging between 0.82 and 0.91 in the training cohort and between 0.77 and 0.86 in the validation cohort. The combination of the metabolomic panels and five baseline clinical factors that include serum prostate-specific antigen, age, family history of PC, previously negative biopsy, and abnormal digital rectal examination results significantly increased AUCs (range 0.88-0.91). At 90% sensitivity (validation cohort), 33%, 34%, 41%, and 36% of unnecessary biopsies were avoided in Models I, II, III, and GS, respectively. The above results were successfully validated using LC-MS with the C18 column. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary metabolomic profiles with baseline clinical factors may accurately predict sPC in men with elevated risk before biopsy."
38862340,Genomic Determinants Associated with Modes of Progression and Patterns of Failure in Metachronous Oligometastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC) represents an early state in the progression of metastatic disease for which patients experience better outcomes in comparison to those with higher disease burden. Despite the generally more indolent nature, there is still much heterogeneity, with some patients experiencing a more aggressive clinical course unexplained by clinical features alone. Our aim was to investigate correlation of tumor genomics with the mode of progression (MOP) and pattern of failure (POF) following first treatment (metastasis-directed and/or systemic therapy) for omCSPC. METHODS: We performed an international multi-institutional retrospective study of men treated for metachronous omCSPC who underwent tumor next-generation sequencing with at least 1 yr of follow-up after their first treatment. Descriptive MOP and POF results are reported with respect to the presence of genomic alterations in pathways of interest. MOP was defined as class I, long-term control (LTC; no radiographic progression at last follow-up), class II, oligoprogression (1-3 lesions), or class III, polyprogression (>/=4 lesions). POF included the location of lesions at first failure. Genomic pathways of interest included TP53, ATM, RB1, BRCA1/2, SPOP, and WNT (APC, CTNNB1, RNF43). Genomic associations with MOP/POF were compared using chi(2) tests. Exploratory analyses revealed that the COSMIC mutational signature and differential gene expression were also correlated with MOP/POF. Overall survival (OS) was calculated via the Kaplan-Meier method from the time of first failure. KEY FINDINGS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: We included 267 patients in our analysis; the majority had either one (47%) or two (30%) metastatic lesions at oligometastasis. The 3-yr OS rate was significantly associated with MOP (71% for polyprogression vs 91% for oligoprogression; p = 0.005). TP53 mutation was associated with a significantly lower LTC rate (27.6% vs 42.3%; p = 0.04) and RB1 mutation was associated with a high rate of polyprogression (50% vs 19.9%; p = 0.022). Regarding POF, bone failure was significantly more common with tumors harboring TP53 mutations (44.8% vs25.9%; p = 0.005) and less common with SPOP mutations (7.1% vs 31.4%; p = 0.007). Visceral failure was more common with tumors harboring either WNT pathway mutations (17.2% vs 6.8%, p = 0.05) or SPOP mutations (17.9% vs 6.3%; p = 0.04). Finally, visceral and bone failures were associated with distinct gene-expression profiles. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Tumor genomics provides novel insight into MOP and POF following treatment for metachronous omCSPC. Patients with TP53 and RB1 mutations have a higher likelihood of progression, and TP53, SPOP, and WNT pathway mutations may have a role in metastatic organotropism. PATIENT SUMMARY: We evaluated cancer progression after a first treatment for metastatic prostate cancer with up to five metastases. We found that mutations in certain genes were associated with the location and extent of further metastasis in these patients."
38861615,MCTP1 increases the malignancy of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells by inducing neuroendocrine differentiation and EMT.,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (PCa) (NEPC), an aggressive subtype that is associated with poor prognosis, may arise after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ADT induces neuroendocrine differentiation in advanced PCa. We found that transmembrane protein 1 (MCTP1), which has putative Ca(2+) sensing function and multiple Ca(2+)-binding C2 domains, was abundant in samples from patients with advanced PCa. MCTP1 was associated with the expression of the EMT-associated transcription factors ZBTB46, FOXA2, and HIF1A. The increased abundance of MCTP1 promoted PC3 prostate cancer cell migration and neuroendocrine differentiation and was associated with SNAI1-dependent EMT in C4-2 PCa cells after ADT. ZBTB46 interacted with FOXA2 and HIF1A and increased the abundance of MCTP1 in a hypoxia-dependent manner. MCTP1 stimulated Ca(2+) signaling and AKT activation to promote EMT and neuroendocrine differentiation by increasing the SNAI1-dependent expression of EMT and neuroendocrine markers, effects that were blocked by knockdown of MCTP1. These data suggest an oncogenic role for MCTP1 in the maintenance of a rare and aggressive prostate cancer subtype through its response to Ca(2+) and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target."
38861238,Overview of Radiation Therapy in the Management of Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal is to describe the evolution of radiation therapy (RT) utilization in the management of localized and metastatic prostate cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Long term data for a variety of hypofractionated definitive RT dose-fractionation schemes has matured, allowing patients and providers many standard-of-care options to choose from. Post-prostatectomy, adjuvant RT has largely been replaced by an early salvage approach. Multiparametric MRI and PSMA PET have enabled increasingly targeted RT delivery to the prostate and oligometastatic tumors. Areas of active investigation include determining the value of proton beam therapy and perirectal spacers, and optimally incorporate genomic tumor profiling and next generation hormonal therapies with RT in the curative setting. The use of radiation therapy to treat prostate cancer is rapidly evolving. In the coming years, there will be continued improvements in a variety of areas to enhance the value of RT in multidisciplinary prostate cancer management."
38860938,Germline Pathogenic Variants Identified in Patients With Genitourinary Malignancies Undergoing Universal Testing: A Multisite Single-Institution Prospective Study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in hereditary cancer genes utilizing a universal testing approach and to determine the rate of PGVs that would have been missed based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in genitourinary (GU) malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multisite, single-institution prospective germline genetic test (GGT) was universally offered to patients with new or active diagnoses of GU malignancies (prostate, bladder, and renal) from April 2018 to March 2020 at Mayo Clinic sites. Participants were offered GGT using a next-generation sequencing panel of > 80 genes. Demographic, tumor characteristics, and genetic results were evaluated. NCCN GU cancer guidelines were used to identify whether patients had incremental findings, defined as PGV-positive patients who would not have received testing based on NCCN guidelines. RESULTS: Of 3095 individuals enrolled in the study, 601 patients had GU cancer (prostate = 358, bladder = 106, and renal = 137). The mean enrollment age was 67 years (SD 9.1), 89% were male, and 86% of patients were non-Hispanic White. PGVs were identified in 82 (14%) of all GU patients. PGV prevalence breakdown by cancer type was: 14% prostate, 14% bladder, and 13% renal cancer. Nearly one-third of identified PGVs were high penetrance, and the majority of these (67%) were clinically actionable. Incremental PGVs were identified in 28 (57%) prostate, 15 (100%) bladder, and 14 (78%) renal cancer patients. Of the 82 patients with PGV findings, 29 (35%) had at least 1 relative undergo cascade testing for the familial variant(s) identified. CONCLUSIONS: More than 1 in 8 patients with GU malignancies were found to carry a PGV, with 67% of patients with high-penetrance PGVs undergoing clinically actionable changes. The majority of these PGVs would not have been identified based on current testing criteria. These findings support universal GGT for GU malignancies and underscore its potential to enhance risk assessment and guide precision interventions in urologic oncology."
38859837,The lncRNA TPT1-AS1 promotes the survival of neuroendocrine prostate cancer cells by facilitating autophagy.,"The lncRNA tumor protein translationally controlled 1-antisense RNA 1 (TPT1-AS1) is known for its oncogenic role in various cancers, but its impact on the pathological progression of prostate cancer remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) regulates neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer (PCA) by derepressing specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including TPT1-AS1. In this study, we revealed that TPT1-AS1 is overexpressed in LNCaP and C4-2B cells after IL-6 and enzalutamide treatment. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate adenocarcinoma dataset, we detected upregulated TPT1-AS1 expression in neuroendocrine-associated PCA but not in prostate adenocarcinoma. Single-cell RNA sequencing data further confirmed the increased TPT1-AS1 levels in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) cells. Surprisingly, functional experiments indicated that TPT1-AS1 overexpression had no stimulatory effect on NED in LNCaP cells and that TPT1-AS1 knockdown did not inhibit IL-6-induced NED. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the essential role of TPT1-AS1 in synaptogenesis and autophagy activation in neuroendocrine differentiated PCA cells induced by IL-6 and enzalutamide treatment. TPT1-AS1 was found to regulate the expression of autophagy-related genes that maintain neuroendocrine cell survival through autophagy activation. In conclusion, our data expand the current knowledge of REST-repressed lncRNAs in NED in PCA and highlight the contribution of TPT1-AS1 to protect neuroendocrine cells from cell death rather than inducing NED. Our study suggested that TPT1-AS1 plays a cytoprotective role in NEPC cells; thus, targeting TPT1-AS1 is a potential therapeutic strategy."
38859780,ROR1-AS1: A Meaningful Long Noncoding RNA in Oncogenesis.,"Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a non-coding RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides, involved in multiple regulatory processes in vivo, and is related to the physiology and pathology of human diseases. An increasing number of experimental results suggest that when lncRNA is abnormally expressed, it results in the development of tumors. LncRNAs can be divided into five broad categories: sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic, and intergenic. Studies have found that some antisense lncRNAs are involved in a variety of human tumorigenesis. The newly identified ROR1-AS1, which functions as an antisense RNA of ROR1, is located in the 1p31.3 region of the human genome. Recent studies have reported that abnormal expression of lncRNA ROR1-AS1 can affect cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and increase oncogenesis and tumor spread, indicating lncRNA ROR1-AS1 as a promising target for many tumor biological therapies. In this study, the pathophysiology and molecular mechanism of ROR1-AS1 in various malignancies are discussed by retrieving the related literature. ROR1-AS1 is a cancer-associated lncRNA, and studies have found that it is either over- or underexpressed in multiple malignancies, including liver cancer, colon cancer, osteosarcoma, glioma, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that lncRNA ROR1-AS1 participates in proliferation, migration, invasion, and suppression of apoptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, lncRNA ROR1-AS1 promotes the development of tumors by up-regulating or downregulating ROR1-AS1 conjugates and various pathways and miR-504, miR-4686, miR-670-3p, and miR-375 sponges, etc., suggesting that lncRNA ROR1-AS1 may be used as a marker in tumors or a potential therapeutic target for a variety of tumors."
38858662,Prognostic marker VPS72 could promote the malignant progression of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This paper attempted to clarify the role and mechanism of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 72 homolog (VPS72) in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: Clinical information and gene expression profiles of patients with prostate cancer were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). VPS72 expression in PCa and the potential mechanism by which VPS72 affects PCa progression was investigated. Next, we performed COX regression analysis to identify the independent prognostic factors of PCa, and constructed a nomogram. The sensitivity of chemotherapeutic medications was anticipated using ""pRRophetic"". Subsequently, in vitro assays to validate the effect of VPS72 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and susceptibility to anti-androgen therapy. RESULTS: The expression of VPS72 was considerably higher in PCa tissues compared to normal tissues. Significant correlations were found between high VPS72 expression and a poor prognosis and adverse clinicopathological factors. The nomogram model constructed based on VPS72 expression has good predictive performance. According to GSEA, VPS72-related genes were enriched in the NF-kB pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway in PCa. Although PCa with low VPS72 expression was more adaptable to chemotherapeutic medications, our in vitro experiment showed that VPS72 knockdown significantly decreased the PCa cell migration, proliferation, and resistance to anti-androgen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In summary our findings suggests that VPS72 could play a crucial role in the malignant progression of PCa, and its expression level can be employed as a possible biomarker of PCa prognosis."
38858492,FOXO3a/PI3K/Akt pathway participates in the ROS- induced apoptosis triggered by alpha-ZEL and beta-ZEL.,"Zearalenone (ZEN), an estrogenic mycotoxin, is one of the most common food and feed contaminants. Also, its metabolites alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZEL) and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZEL) are considered to induce oxidative stress, however its effect in prostate cells is not known yet. Our previous observations showed that forehead box transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a) expression is modified in hormone- sensitive cells in the response to mycotoxins, similar to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Thus, this study evaluated the direct molecular effect of alpha-ZEL and beta-ZEL in a dose of 30 microM in hormone-dependent human prostate cancer (PCa) cells with the focus of the involvement of FOXO3a and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in that effect. We observed that both active metabolites of ZEN reduced cell viability, induced oxidative stress, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa cells. Furthermore, we observed that FOXO3a as well as PI3K/Akt signaling pathway participate in ZELs induced toxicity in PCa cells, indicating that this signaling pathway might be a regulator of mycotoxin-induced toxicity generally."
38855324,"The prognostic value of Dickkopf-3 (Dkk3), TGFB1 and ECM-1 in prostate cancer.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered one of the most common cancers worldwide. Despite advances in patient diagnosis, management, and risk stratification, 10%-20% of patients progress to castration-resistant disease. Our previous report highlighted a protective role of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) in PCa stroma. This role was proposed to be mediated through opposing extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM-1) and TGF-beta signalling activity. However, a detailed analysis of the prognostic value of DKK3, ECM-1 and members of the TGF-beta signalling pathway in PCa was not thoroughly investigated. In this study, we explored the prognostic value of DKK3, ECM-1 and TGFB1 using a bioinformatical approach through analysis of large publicly available datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TGCA) and Pan-Cancer Atlas databases. Our results showed a significant gradual loss of DKK3 expression with PCa progression (p < 0.0001) associated with increased DNA methylation in its promoter region (p < 1.63E-12). In contrast, patients with metastatic lesions showed significantly higher levels of TGFB1 expression compared to primary tumours (p < 0.00001). Our results also showed a marginal association between more advanced tumour stage presented as positive lymph node involvement and low DKK3 mRNA expression (p = 0.082). However, while ECM1 showed no association with tumour stage (p = 0.773), high TGFB1 expression showed a significant association with more advanced stage presented as advanced T3 stage compared to patients with low TGFB1 mRNA expression (p < 0.001). Interestingly, while ECM1 showed no significant association with patient outcome, patients with high DKK3 mRNA expression showed a significant association with favourable outcomes presented as prolonged disease-specific (p = 0.0266), progression-free survival (p = 0.047) and disease-free (p = 0.05). In contrast, high TGFB1 mRNA expression showed a significant association with poor patient outcomes presented as shortened progression-free (p = 0.00032) and disease-free survival (p = 0.0433). Moreover, DKK3, TGFB1 and ECM1 have acted as immune-associated genes in the PCa tumour microenvironment. In conclusion, our findings showed a distinct prognostic value for this three-gene signature in PCa. While both DKK3 and TGFB1 showed a potential role as a clinical marker for PCa stratification, ECM1 showed no significant association with the majority of clinicopathological parameters, which reduce its clinical significance as a reliable prognostic marker."
38853880,Large-scale integration of omics and electronic health records to identify potential risk protein biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for cancer prevention and intervention.,"Identifying risk protein targets and their therapeutic drugs is crucial for effective cancer prevention. Here, we conduct integrative and fine-mapping analyses of large genome-wide association studies data for breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and characterize 710 lead variants independently associated with cancer risk. Through mapping protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for these variants using plasma proteomics data from over 75,000 participants, we identify 365 proteins associated with cancer risk. Subsequent colocalization analysis identifies 101 proteins, including 74 not reported in previous studies. We further characterize 36 potential druggable proteins for cancers or other disease indications. Analyzing >3.5 million electronic health records, we uncover five drugs (Haloperidol, Trazodone, Tranexamic Acid, Haloperidol, and Captopril) associated with increased cancer risk and two drugs (Caffeine and Acetazolamide) linked to reduced colorectal cancer risk. This study offers novel insights into therapeutic drugs targeting risk proteins for cancer prevention and intervention."
38853421,TNIK Inhibition Sensitizes TNIK-Overexpressing Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma to Radiotherapy.,"Most patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) undergo chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and adjuvant immunotherapy for locally advanced disease. The efficacy of these treatments is still limited because of dose-limiting toxicity or locoregional recurrence. New combination approaches and targets such as actionable oncogenic drivers are needed to advance treatment options for patients with LSCC. Moreover, other options for chemotherapy-ineligible patients are limited. As such, there is a critical need for the development of selective and potent chemoradiosensitizers for locally advanced LSCC. In this study, we investigated inhibiting TRAF2- and NCK-interacting protein kinase (TNIK), which is amplified in 40% of patients with LSCC, as a strategy to sensitize LSCC tumors to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Employing a range of human LSCC cell lines and the TNIK inhibitor NCB-0846, we investigated the potential of TNIK as a chemo- and radiosensitizing target with in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. The combination of NCB-0846 with cisplatin or etoposide was at best additive. Interestingly, pre-treating LSCC cells with NCB-0846 prior to ionizing radiation (IR) potentiated the cytotoxicity of IR in a TNIK-specific fashion. Characterization of the radiosensitization mechanism suggested that TNIK inhibition may impair the DNA damage response and promote mitotic catastrophe in irradiated cells. In a subcutaneous xenograft in vivo model, pretreatment with NCB-0846 significantly enhanced the efficacy of IR and caused elevated necrosis in TNIKhigh LK2 tumors but not TNIKlow KNS62 tumors. Overall, these results indicate that TNIK inhibition may be a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy in patients with LSCC with high TNIK expression."
38853085,HPV integration and cervical cancer: a failed evolutionary viral trait.,"Countless efforts have been made to eradicate cervical cancer worldwide, including improving disease screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs. Nevertheless, cervical cancer still claims the lives of more than 300 000 women every year. Persistent infections with high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 are the main cause of cancer and may result in HPV integration into the host genome. The central dogma is that HPV integration is an important step in oncogenesis, but in fact, it impedes the virus from replicating and spreading. HPV causing cervical cancer can therefore be perceived as a failed evolutionary viral trait. Here we outline the occurrence and mechanisms of HPV integration and how this process results in oncogenic transformation."
38851995,"Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer by a Specific Collagen-related Transcriptome, Proteome, and Urinome Signature.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While collagen density has been associated with poor outcomes in various cancers, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains elusive. Our aim was to analyze collagen-related transcriptomic, proteomic, and urinome alterations in the context of detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa, International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group >/=2). METHODS: Comprehensive analyses for PCa transcriptome (n = 1393), proteome (n = 104), and urinome (n = 923) data sets focused on 55 collagen-related genes. Investigation of the cellular source of collagen-related transcripts via single-cell RNA sequencing was conducted. Statistical evaluations, clustering, and machine learning models were used for data analysis to identify csPCa signatures. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Differential expression of 30 of 55 collagen-related genes and 34 proteins was confirmed in csPCa in comparison to benign prostate tissue or ISUP 1 cancer. A collagen-high cancer cluster exhibited distinct cellular and molecular characteristics, including fibroblast and endothelial cell infiltration, intense extracellular matrix turnover, and enhanced growth factor and inflammatory signaling. Robust collagen-based machine learning models were established to identify csPCa. The models outcompeted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and age, showing comparable performance to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in predicting csPCa. Of note, the urinome-based collagen model identified four of five csPCa cases among patients with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-IRADS) 3 lesions, for which the presence of csPCa is considered equivocal. The retrospective character of the study is a limitation. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Collagen-related transcriptome, proteome, and urinome signatures exhibited superior accuracy in detecting csPCa in comparison to PSA and age. The collagen signatures, especially in cases of ambiguous lesions on mpMRI, successfully identified csPCa and could potentially reduce unnecessary biopsies. The urinome-based collagen signature represents a promising liquid biopsy tool that requires prospective evaluation to improve the potential of this collagen-based approach to enhance diagnostic precision in PCa for risk stratification and guiding personalized interventions. PATIENT SUMMARY: In our study, collagen-related alterations in tissue, and urine were able to predict the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer at primary diagnosis."
38851846,FOXA2 rewires AP-1 for transcriptional reprogramming and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.,"FOXA family proteins act as pioneer factors by remodeling compact chromatin structures. FOXA1 is crucial for the chromatin binding of the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal prostate epithelial cells and the luminal subtype of prostate cancer (PCa). Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of FOXA2 as an adaptive response to AR signaling inhibition treatments. However, the role of the FOXA1 to FOXA2 transition in regulating cancer lineage plasticity remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that FOXA2 binds to distinct classes of developmental enhancers in multiple AR-independent PCa subtypes, with its binding depending on LSD1. Moreover, we reveal that FOXA2 collaborates with JUN at chromatin and promotes transcriptional reprogramming of AP-1 in lineage-plastic cancer cells, thereby facilitating cell state transitions to multiple lineages. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of FOXA2 as a pan-plasticity driver that rewires AP-1 to induce the differential transcriptional reprogramming necessary for cancer cell lineage plasticity."
38850798,Construction of a novel cancer-associated fibroblast-related signature to predict clinical outcome and immune response in cervical cancer.,"This study developed a prognostic signature for cervical cancer using transcriptome profiling and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and TISCH database, focusing on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Through LASSO Cox regression and integrated bioinformatics analyses, we identified 144 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to CAFs, from which an 11-gene CAF-related signature (CAFRSig) was constructed. The CAFRSig effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk categories, demonstrating significant prognostic capability in predicting overall survival. Gene ontology (GO) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) linked the DEGs to crucial pathways in tumor malignancy, immune response, and fatty acid metabolism. The immune landscape analysis, utilizing the TIMER platform and CIBERSORT algorithm, revealed a positive correlation between immune cell effector functions and CAFRSig scores, highlighting the model's potential to identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. Furthermore, neuropilin 1 (NRP1), a key gene in the CAFRSig, was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and associated with disease progression and differentiation. The downregulation of NRP1 curbed cell proliferation and influenced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), implicating the PI3K/AKT pathway and modulating PD-L1 expression. This comprehensive analysis establishes a robust prognostic signature based on CAF-related genes, offering valuable insights for optimizing therapeutic strategies in cervical cancer management."
38850471,Association between PDCD6-VNTR polymorphism and urinary cancer susceptibility.,"BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death 6 (PDCD6) is known to be involved in apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Given the reported association with urinary cancer susceptibility through SNP analysis, we further analyzed the entire genomic structure of PDCD6. METHODS: Three VNTR regions (MS1-MS3) were identified through the analysis of the genomic structure of PDCD6. To investigate the association between these VNTR regions and urinary cancer susceptibility, genomic DNA was extracted from 413 cancer-free male controls, 267 bladder cancer patients, and 331 prostate cancer patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the PDCD6-MS regions. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between specific genotypes and cancer risk. In addition, the effect of specific VNTRs on PDCD6 expression was also confirmed using a reporter vector. RESULTS: Among the three VNTR regions, MS1 and MS2 exhibited monomorphism, while the MS3 region represented polymorphism, with its transmission to subsequent generations through meiosis substantiating its utility as a DNA typing marker. In a case-control study, the presence of rare alleles within PDCD6-MS3 exhibited significant associations with both bladder cancer (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.33-4.95, P = 0.019) and prostate cancer (OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.03-4.36, P = 0.038). Furthermore, through luciferase assays, we validated the impact of the MS3 region on modulating PDCD6 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the PDCD6-MS3 region could serve as a prognostic marker for urinary cancers, specifically bladder cancer and prostate cancer. Moreover, the subdued influence exerted by PDCD6-MS3 on the expression of PDCD6 offers another insight concerning the progression of urinary cancer."
28613748,Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer).,"The Epidemiology of the Syndrome Colorectal cancer is the third-most common cancer in men and women and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with an estimated 152,020 new cases and 52,550 deaths in 2023. While most colorectal cancers are sporadic, inherited mutations cause approximately 5% to 10% of cases. The most common hereditary form of colorectal cancer is Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Identifying patients with Lynch syndrome is important because their lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 80%, and up to 60% for endometrial cancer. Other primary cancers part of Lynch syndrome include gastric, ovarian, small bowel, urothelial (ureter, renal pelvis, and bladder), prostate, biliary tract, pancreatic, adrenocortical, brain cancers (glioblastoma), sebaceous gland adenomas, and keratoacanthomas. The History of Lynch Syndrome In 1962, a medical intern named Henry Lynch learned that a young hospitalized farm worker suffering from alcohol poisoning was certain he would die young of cancer due to the prevalence of cancer in his family. Dr. Lynch decided to investigate this family. He bought a camper van equipped with basic laboratory instruments. He spent weekends for the next 2 years touring rural Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, collecting medical records, histories, pathology reports, and blood samples from extended family members. He discovered that an unusually high number died of colon cancer before age 50. He could not find any plausible explanation save for genetic transmission. He presented his findings in 1964 and applied for several grants to allow him to investigate further, but was consistently turned down as these cancers were attributed to environmental causes. Dr Lynch continued his research, but his theories were widely discredited until molecular genetics techniques developed in the 1980s led to the discovery of the mismatch repair gene deficiencies and associated microsatellite instabilities found in these heritable cancers. HNPCC was renamed Lynch syndrome in his honor in 1984. Dr Lynch, the father of cancer genetics, is credited with facilitating many breakthroughs in cancer genetics, including identifying the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome and the BRCA genes and creating the entire field of cancer genomics."
38848214,Role of the afferent lymph as an immunological conduit to analyze tissue antigenic and inflammatory load.,"The lymphatic fluid is the conduit by which part of the tissue ""omics"" is transported to the draining lymph node for immunosurveillance. Following cannulation of the pre-nodal cervical and mesenteric afferent lymphatics, herein we investigate the lymph proteomic composition, uncovering that its composition varies according to the tissue of origin. Tissue specificity is also reflected in the dendritic cell-major histocompatibility complex class II-eluted immunopeptidome harvested from the cervical and mesenteric nodes. Following inflammatory disruption of the gut barrier, the lymph antigenic and inflammatory loads are analyzed in both mice and subjects with inflammatory bowel diseases. Gastrointestinal tissue damage reflects the lymph inflammatory and damage-associated molecular pattern signatures, microbiome-derived by-products, and immunomodulatory molecules, including metabolites of the gut-brain axis, mapped in the afferent mesenteric lymph. Our data point to the relevance of the lymphatic fluid to probe the tissue-specific antigenic and inflammatory load transported to the draining lymph node for immunosurveillance."
38845201,Transcriptome-wide association analysis identifies candidate susceptibility genes for prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer.,"Deciphering the genetic basis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may improve their utility for prostate cancer (PCa) screening. Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 95,768 PCa-free men, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to examine impacts of genetically predicted gene expression on PSA. Analyses identified 41 statistically significant (p < 0.05/12,192 = 4.10 x 10(-6)) associations in whole blood and 39 statistically significant (p < 0.05/13,844 = 3.61 x 10(-6)) associations in prostate tissue, with 18 genes associated in both tissues. Cross-tissue analyses identified 155 statistically significantly (p < 0.05/22,249 = 2.25 x 10(-6)) genes. Out of 173 unique PSA-associated genes across analyses, we replicated 151 (87.3%) in a TWAS of 209,318 PCa-free individuals from the Million Veteran Program. Based on conditional analyses, we found 20 genes (11 single tissue, nine cross-tissue) that were associated with PSA levels in the discovery TWAS that were not attributable to a lead variant from a GWAS. Ten of these 20 genes replicated, and two of the replicated genes had colocalization probability of >0.5: CCNA2 and HIST1H2BN. Six of the 20 identified genes are not known to impact PCa risk. Fine-mapping based on whole blood and prostate tissue revealed five protein-coding genes with evidence of causal relationships with PSA levels. Of these five genes, four exhibited evidence of colocalization and one was conditionally independent of previous GWAS findings. These results yield hypotheses that should be further explored to improve understanding of genetic factors underlying PSA levels."
38844946,CAPN2 promotes apalutamide resistance in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer by activating protective autophagy.,"Apalutamide, a novel endocrine therapy agent, has been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, resistance to apalutamide has also been reported, and the underlying mechanism for this response has yet to be clearly elucidated. First, this study established apalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and confirmed that apalutamide activated the release of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to enhance autophagy. Second, RNA sequencing, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed significantly decreased Calpain 2 (CAPN2) expression in the apalutamide-resistant PCa cells and tissues. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that CAPN2 promoted apalutamide resistance by activating protective autophagy. CAPN2 promoted autophagy by reducing Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) degradation while increasing nuclear translocation via nucleoplasmic protein isolation and immunofluorescence. In addition, FOXO1 promoted protective autophagy through the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5). Furthermore, a dual-fluorescence assay confirmed that transcription factor 3 (ATF3) stimulation promoted CAPN2-mediated autophagy activation via transcriptional regulation. In summary, CAPN2 activated protective autophagy by inhibiting FOXO1 degradation and promoting its nuclear translocation via transcriptional ATG5 regulation. ATF3 activation and transcriptional CAPN2 regulation jointly promoted this bioeffect. Thus, our findings have not only revealed the mechanism underlying apalutamide resistance, but also provided a promising new target for the treatment of metastatic PCa."
38843742,"Association of cancer and schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder: A Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression have been reported to be associated with some cancers. However, the magnitude of the causal relationship between them remains unclear. This study aims to explore the potential association between three major mental diseases and the risk of some cancers. METHODS: We performed the two-sample Mendelian randomization(MR) analysis using publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) statistics to investigate the causal relationship between these three mental diseases and some common types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, malignant melanoma and glioma. We obtained genetic association estimates for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.The genetic association estimates for cancers were obtained from the UK Biobank, the MRC-IEU consortium and the GliomaScan consortium. RESULTS: After correction for heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy, we detected suggestive evidence for the association between thyroid cancer and genetically predicted schizophrenia (OR = 1.543, 95% CI: 1.023-2.328, P = 0.039), and thyroid cancer and major depression (OR = 3.573, 95% CI: 1.068-11.953, P = 0.039). No evidence of causal effects of schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder on other types of cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the association of schizophrenia and major depression and the development of thyroid cancer."
38842134,Integrative bioinformatics approach yields a novel gene expression risk model for prognosis and progression prediction in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa), a prevalent malignancy among elderly males, exhibits a notable rate of advancement, even when subjected to conventional androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy. An effective progression prediction model would prove invaluable in identifying patients with a higher progression risk. Using bioinformatics strategies, we integrated diverse data sets of PCa to construct a novel risk model predicated on gene expression and progression-free survival (PFS). The accuracy of the model was assessed through validation using an independent data set. Eight genes were discerned as independent prognostic factors and included in the prediction model. Patients assigned to the high-risk cohort demonstrated a diminished PFS, and the areas under the curve of our model in the validation set for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year PFS were 0.9325, 0.9041 and 0.9070, respectively. Additionally, through the application of single-cell RNA sequencing to two castration-related prostate cancer (CRPC) samples and two hormone-related prostate cancer (HSPC) samples, we discovered that luminal cells within CRPC exhibited an elevated risk score. Subsequent molecular biology experiments corroborated our findings, illustrating heightened SYK expression levels within tumour tissues and its contribution to cancer cell migration. We found that the knockdown of SYK could inhibit migration in PCa cells. Our progression-related risk model demonstrated the potential prognostic value of SYK and indicated its potential as a target for future diagnosis and treatment strategies in PCa management."
38841885,"Knowledge on Human Papillomavirus Infections, Cancer Biology, Immune Interactions, Vaccination Coverage and Common Treatments: A Comprehensive Review.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a circular, double-stranded DNA virus and recognized as the most prevalent sexually transmitted infectious agent worldwide. The HPV life cycle encompasses three primary stages. First, the virus infiltrates the basal cells of the stratified epidermis. Second, there is a low-level expression of viral genes and preservation of the viral genome in the basal layer. Lastly, productive replication of HPV occurs in differentiated cells. An effective immune response, involving various immune cells, including innate immunity, keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer T cells, is instrumental in clearing HPV infection and thwarting the development of HPV-associated tumors. Vaccines have demonstrated their efficacy in preventing genital warts, high-grade precancerous lesions, and cancers in females. In males, the vaccines can also aid in preventing genital warts, anal precancerous lesions, and cancer. This comprehensive review aims to provide a thorough and detailed exploration of HPV infections, delving into its genetic characteristics, life cycle, pathogenesis, and the role of high-risk and low-risk HPV strains. In addition, this review seeks to elucidate the intricate immune interactions that govern HPV infections, spanning from innate immunity to adaptive immune responses, as well as examining the evasion mechanisms used by the virus. Furthermore, the article discusses the current landscape of HPV vaccines and common treatments, contributing to a holistic understanding of HPV and its associated diseases."
38839987,POT1 tumour predisposition: a broader spectrum of associated malignancies and proposal for additional screening program.,"Protection of Telomeres Protein 1 (POT1) protein is an essential subunit of the shelterin telomere binding complex, regulating telomere length. Some POT1 gene pathogenic variants (PV) lead to telomere elongation, genomic instability and higher risk of cancer. POT1 tumour predisposition syndrome (POT1-TPD) has autosomal dominant inheritance and unknown penetrance. It is associated with increased risk of cutaneous melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, angiosarcoma and gliomas. In this work, we aim to describe a broader cancer phenotype related to POT1-TPD, in three families (two with a four generation pedigree, one with a five generation pedigree). The three index cases were referred to our oncogenetic centre for genetic counselling due to their personal history of cancer. Two underwent clinical exome sequencing of 4,867 genes associated with Mendelian genetic diseases, and another underwent gene panel sequencing including POT1, which identified three different POT1 PV: NC_000007.14(NM_015450.2):c.349C>T; NC_000007.14(NM_015450.2):c.233T>C and NC_000007.14(NM_015450.2):c.818G>A; already described in the literature. Referenced relatives, did a target genetic test (according to the POT1 PV identified in the family). In total, 37 individuals were tested (51.4% females), median age of 46 (22-81) years, with POT1 PV detected in 22. POT1-TPD was observed, but also a higher incidence of other cancers (other sarcomas, papillary thyroid cancer, early onset prostate cancer and leukaemia). These findings contribute to an increase in our knowledge about POT1 PV, and it can play a role in the definition of future POT1 PV screening criteria, POT1 carrier surveillance protocols (possibly considering screening for all types of sarcomas) and in genetic counselling."
38839666,Urinary extracellular vesicle-derived miR-126-3p predicts lymph node invasion in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.,"To investigate extracellular vesicles (EVs), biomarkers for predicting lymph node invasion (LNI) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HRPCa), plasma, and/or urine samples were prospectively collected from 45 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and five with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Small RNA sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs in the EVs. All patients with PCa underwent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in patients with and without pathologically-verified LNI. The candidate miRNAs were validated in low-risk prostate cancer (LRPCa) and BPH. Four miRNA species (e.g., miR-126-3p) and three miRNA species (e.g., miR-27a-3p) were more abundant in urinary and plasma EVs, respectively, of patients with PCa. None of these miRNA species were shared between urinary and plasma EVs. miR-126-3p was significantly more abundant in patients with HR PCa with LNI than in those without (P = 0.018). miR-126-3p was significantly more abundant in the urinary EVs of patients with HRPCa than in those with LRPCa (P = 0.017) and BPH (P = 0.011). In conclusion, urinary EVs-derived miR-126-3p may serve as a good biomarker for predicting LNI in patients with HRPCa."
38839570,The psychosocial impact of prostate cancer screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.,"OBJECTIVES: To report the long-term outcomes from a longitudinal psychosocial study that forms part of the 'Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted Screening in men at higher genetic risk and controls' (IMPACT) study. The IMPACT study is a multi-national study of targeted prostate cancer (PrCa) screening in individuals with a known germline pathogenic variant (GPV) in either the BReast CAncer gene 1 (BRCA1) or the BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA2). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Participants enrolled in the IMPACT study were invited to complete a psychosocial questionnaire prior to each annual screening visit for a minimum of 5 years. The questionnaire included questions on sociodemographics and the following measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Impact of Event Scale, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, Memorial Anxiety Scale for PrCa, Cancer Worry Scale, risk perception and knowledge. RESULTS: A total of 760 participants completed questionnaires: 207 participants with GPV in BRCA1, 265 with GPV in BRCA2 and 288 controls (non-carriers from families with a known GPV). We found no evidence of clinically concerning levels of general or cancer-specific distress or poor health-related quality of life in the cohort as a whole. Individuals in the control group had significantly less worry about PrCa compared with the carriers; however, all mean scores were low and within reported general population norms, where available. BRCA2 carriers with previously high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels experience a small but significant increase in PrCa anxiety (P = 0.01) and PSA-specific anxiety (P < 0.001). Cancer risk perceptions reflected information provided during genetic counselling and participants had good levels of knowledge, although this declined over time. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the longitudinal psychosocial impact of a targeted PrCa screening programme for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. The results reassure that an annual PSA-based screening programme does not have an adverse impact on psychosocial health or health-related quality of life in these higher-risk individuals. These results are important as more PrCa screening is targeted to higher-risk groups."
38837741,Allelic loss of HLA class I facilitates evasion from immune surveillance in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been reported to occur in HLA regions in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. However, the details of how this is related to the progression of CIN have been unclear. In this study, we examined the human papillomavirus (HPV) antigen-presenting capacity of people with CIN and the significance of LOH of HLA class I in the progression of CIN. It was shown that differences in antigen-presenting capacity among each case depended on HLA types, not HPV genotypes. Focusing on the HLA type, there was a positive correlation between antigen-presenting capacity against HPV and the frequency of allelic loss. Furthermore, the lost HLA-B alleles had a higher HPV antigen-presenting capacity than intact alleles. In addition, frequency of LOH of HLA class I was significantly higher in advanced CIN (CIN2-3) than in cervicitis or early-stage CIN (CIN1): around half of CIN2-3 had LOH of any HLA class I. Moreover, the antigen-presenting capacity against E5, which is the HPV proteins that facilitate viral escape from this immune surveillance by suppressing HLA class I expression, had the most significant impact on the LOH in HLA-B. This study suggests that HPV evades immune surveillance mechanisms when host cells lose the capacity for antigen presentation by HLA class I molecules, resulting in long-term infection and progression to advanced lesions."
38837608,A phase II trial of apalutamide for intermediate-risk prostate cancer and molecular correlates.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether 6 months of preoperative apalutamide for intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IRPCa) reduces the aggregate postoperative radiotherapy risk and to evaluate associations of molecular perturbations with clinical outcomes in this study cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2018 and February 2020, eligible patients with IRPCa (Gleason 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 and clinical T2b-c or prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL) were treated with apalutamide 240 mg/day for 6 months followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) in this single-arm, phase II trial. The primary endpoint was presence of any adverse pathological feature at risk of pelvic radiation (pathological T stage after neoadjuvant therapy [yp]T3 or ypN1 or positive surgical margins). Translational studies, including germline and somatic DNA alterations and RNA and protein expression, were performed on post-apalutamide RP specimens, and assessed for associations with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients underwent a RP, and only one patient discontinued apalutamide prior to 6 months. In all, 40% had adverse pathological features at time of RP, and the 3-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was 15%, with 27.5% being not evaluable. Genomic alterations frequently seen in metastatic PCas, such as androgen receptor (AR), tumour protein p53 (TP53), phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), or BReast CAncer associated gene (BRCA1/2) were underrepresented in this localised cohort. Adverse pathological features and BCR at 3-years were associated with increased expression of select cell cycle (e.g., E2F targets: adjusted P value [P(adj)] < 0.001, normalised enrichment score [NES] 2.47) and oxidative phosphorylation (P(adj) < 0.001, NES 1.62) pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative apalutamide did not reduce the aggregate postoperative radiation risk to the pre-specified threshold in unselected men with IRPCa. However, transcriptomic analysis identified key dysregulated pathways in tumours associated with adverse pathological outcomes and BCR, which warrant future study. Further investigation of preoperative therapy is underway for men with high-risk PCa."
38835778,Targeted proteomics-determined multi-biomarker profiles developed classifier for prognosis and immunotherapy responses of advanced cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) poses a global health challenge, with a particularly poor prognosis in cases of recurrence, metastasis, or advanced stages. A single biomarker is inadequate to predict CC prognosis or identify CC patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy, presumably owing to tumor complexity and heterogeneity. METHODS: Using advanced Olink proteomics, we analyzed 92 oncology-related proteins in plasma from CC patients receiving immunotherapy, based upon the comparison of protein expression levels of pre-therapy with those of therapy-Cycle 6 in the partial response (PR) group and progressive disease (PD) group, respectively. RESULTS: 55 proteins were identified to exhibit differential expression trends across pre-therapy and post-therapy in both PR and PD groups. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were associated with vital oncological and immunological processes. A logistic regression model, using 5 proteins (ITGB5, TGF-alpha, TLR3, WIF-1, and ERBB3) with highest AUC values, demonstrated good predictive performance for prognosis of CC patients undergoing immunotherapy and showed potential across different cancer types. The effectiveness of these proteins in prognosis prediction was further validated using TCGA-CESC datasets. A negative correlation and previously unidentified roles of WIF-1 in CC immunotherapy was also first determined. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal multi-biomarker profiles effectively predicting CC prognosis and identifying patients benefitting most from immunotherapy, especially for those with limited treatment options and traditionally poor prognosis, paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic treatments and improved clinical strategies."
38835514,Effect of smoking on prostate cancer: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2018 and Mendelian randomization analyses.,"INTRODUCTION: The controversial relationship between smoking and prostate cancer (PCa) risk prompted us to conduct a cross-sectional study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in order to clarify the possible causal effect of smoking on PCa risk. METHODS: Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods, a secondary analysis of the pooled 2003-2018 NHANES dataset was performed to explore the association between smoking and PCa risk. Propensity-score matching was used to reduce selection bias. Then, we conducted subsequent MR analysis study to investigate the potential causal effect of smoking on PCa risk, with genetic variants of four exposure factors including the lifetime smoking index, light smoking, smoking initiation, and the amount of smoking per day obtained from genome-wide association studies, and PCa summary statistics obtained from three database populations. Inverse-variance weighting was the primary analytical method, and weighted median and MR-Egger regression were used for sensitivity analyses. The MR results for the three PCa databases were combined using meta-analysis. RESULTS: The study included 16073 NHANES subjects, comprising 554 with PCa and 15519 without PCa. Logistic regression before and after matching did not reveal any significant association. Meta-analysis of the MR results also did not support an association of PCa risk with lifetime smoking index (OR=0.95; 95% CI: 0.83-1.09), light smoking (OR=1.00; 95% CI: 0.95-1.06), smoking initiation (OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.99-1.00), or the amount of smoking per day (OR=1.00; 95% CI: 0.99-1.00) and PCa risk. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence for an association between smoking and the risk of PCa. Further studies are needed to determine if there are any associations of other forms of smoking with the risk of PCa at different stages."
38835075,Optimizing clinico-genomic disease prediction across ancestries: a machine learning strategy with Pareto improvement.,"BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of an individual's predisposition to diseases is vital for preventive medicine and early intervention. Various statistical and machine learning models have been developed for disease prediction using clinico-genomic data. However, the accuracy of clinico-genomic prediction of diseases may vary significantly across ancestry groups due to their unequal representation in clinical genomic datasets. METHODS: We introduced a deep transfer learning approach to improve the performance of clinico-genomic prediction models for data-disadvantaged ancestry groups. We conducted machine learning experiments on multi-ancestral genomic datasets of lung cancer, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as on synthetic datasets with built-in data inequality and distribution shifts across ancestry groups. RESULTS: Deep transfer learning significantly improved disease prediction accuracy for data-disadvantaged populations in our multi-ancestral machine learning experiments. In contrast, transfer learning based on linear frameworks did not achieve comparable improvements for these data-disadvantaged populations. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that deep transfer learning can enhance fairness in multi-ancestral machine learning by improving prediction accuracy for data-disadvantaged populations without compromising prediction accuracy for other populations, thus providing a Pareto improvement towards equitable clinico-genomic prediction of diseases."
38833720,Novel Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Gynecologic Tumors.,"Androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (AR-V7) is a truncated variant of the AR mRNA that may be a predictive biomarker for AR-targeted therapy. AR-V7 has been described in prostate, breast, salivary duct, and hepatocellular carcinomas as well as mammary and extra-mammary Paget disease. We report 2 gynecologic cancers occurring in the lower uterine segment and ovary and both harboring AR-V7 by targeted RNA sequencing. The uterine tumor was an undifferentiated carcinoma consisting of epithelioid cells and focally spindled cells arranged in sheets, nests, and cords associated with brisk mitotic activity and tumor necrosis. The ovarian tumor consisted of glands with cribriform and solid architecture and uniform cytologic atypia. ER and PR were positive in the ovarian tumor and negative in the uterine tumor. Both were positive for AR and negative for HER2, GATA3, and NKX3.1. DNA methylation profiling showed epigenetic similarity of the AR-V7-positive gynecologic cancers to AR-V7-positive breast cancers rather than to prostate cancers. AR-V7 may underpin rare gynecologic carcinomas with undifferentiated histology or cribriform growth reminiscent of prostatic adenocarcinoma and breast invasive ductal carcinoma."
38833013,Deciphering the role of zinc homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment and prognosis of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis is widely recognized as a hallmark feature of prostate cancer (PCa) based on the compelling clinical and experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the implications of zinc dyshomeostasis in PCa remains largely unexplored. METHODS: In this research, the zinc homeostasis pattern subtype (ZHPS) was constructed according to the profile of zinc homeostasis genes. The identified subtypes were assessed for their immune functions, mutational landscapes, biological peculiarities and drug susceptibility. Subsequently, we developed the optimal signature, known as the zinc homeostasis-related risk score (ZHRRS), using the approach won out in multifariously machine learning algorithms. Eventually, clinical specimens, Bayesian network inference and single-cell sequencing were used to excavate the underlying mechanisms of MT1A in PCa. RESULTS: The zinc dyshomeostasis subgroup, ZHPS2, possessed a markedly worse prognosis than ZHPS1. Moreover, ZHPS2 demonstrated a more conspicuous genomic instability and better therapeutic responses to docetaxel and olaparib than ZHPS1. Compared with traditional clinicopathological characteristics and 35 published signatures, ZHRRS displayed a significantly improved accuracy in prognosis prediction. The diagnostic value of MT1A in PCa was substantiated through analysis of clinical samples. Additionally, we inferred and established the regulatory network of MT1A to elucidate its biological mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The ZHPS classifier and ZHRRS model hold great potential as clinical applications for improving outcomes of PCa patients."
38832955,USP47 deficiency in mice modulates tumor infiltrating immune cells and enhances antitumor immune responses in prostate cancer.,"This study investigates the role of USP47, a deubiquitinating enzyme, in the tumor microenvironment and its impact on antitumor immune responses. Analysis of TCGA database revealed distinct expression patterns of USP47 in various tumor tissues and normal tissues. Prostate adenocarcinoma showed significant downregulation of USP47 compared to normal tissue. Correlation analysis demonstrated a positive association between USP47 expression levels and infiltrating CD8(+) T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, while showing a negative correlation with NKT cells. Furthermore, using Usp47 knockout mice, we observed a slower tumor growth rate and reduced tumor burden. The absence of USP47 led to increased infiltration of immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, NKT cells, and T cells. Additionally, USP47 deficiency resulted in enhanced activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and altered T cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment. These findings suggest that USP47 plays a critical role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting antitumor immune responses, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer."
38831447,Mendelian randomization evidence based on European ancestry for the causal effects of leukocyte telomere length on prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence suggest that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) can affect the development of prostate cancer (PC). METHODS: Here, we employed single nucleoside polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) for LTL (n = 472,174) and conducted Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate their causal impact on PCs (79,148 patients/61,106 controls and 6311 patients/88,902 controls). RESULTS: Every 1-s.d extension of LTL increased the risk of PCs by 34%. Additionally, the analysis of candidate mediators between LTL and PCs via two-step Mendelian randomization revealed that among the 23 candidates, Alzheimer's disease, liver iron content, sex hormone binding global levels, naive CD4-CD8-T cell% T cell, and circulating leptin levels played substantial mediating roles. There is no robust evidence to support the reverse causal relationship between LTL and the selected mediators of PCs. Adjusting for the former four mediators, rather than adjusting for circulating leptin levels, decreased the impact of LTL on PCs. CONCLUSION: This study provides potential intervention measures for preventing LTL-induced PCs."
38831406,Temporal composition of the cervicovaginal microbiome associates with hrHPV infection outcomes in a longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: Persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) can cause cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) that may progress to cancer. The cervicovaginal microbiome (CVM) correlates with SIL, but the temporal composition of the CVM after hrHPV infections has not been fully clarified. METHODS: To determine the association between the CVM composition and infection outcome, we applied high-resolution microbiome profiling using the circular probe-based RNA sequencing technology on a longitudinal cohort of cervical smears obtained from 141 hrHPV DNA-positive women with normal cytology at first visit, of whom 51 were diagnosed by cytology with SIL six months later. RESULTS: Here we show that women with a microbial community characterized by low diversity and high Lactobacillus crispatus abundance at both visits exhibit low risk to SIL development, while women with a microbial community characterized by high diversity and Lactobacillus depletion at first visit have a higher risk of developing SIL. At the level of individual species, we observed that a high abundance for Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae at both visits associate with SIL outcomes. These species together with Dialister micraerophilus showed a moderate discriminatory power for hrHPV infection progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the CVM can potentially be used as a biomarker for cervical disease and SIL development after hrHPV infection diagnosis with implications on cervical cancer prevention strategies and treatment of SIL."
38831394,Ethanolic extract from Sophora moorcroftiana inhibit cell proliferation and alter the mechanical properties of human cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies. Previous studies have shown that the ethanol extract of Sophora moorcroftiana seeds (EESMS) possesses an antiproliferative effect on several tumors in vitro. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the impact of EESMS on human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell proliferation. METHODS: The proliferation and apoptotic effects of HeLa cells treated with EESMS were evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Single-cell level atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted to detect the mechanical properties of HeLa cells, and proteomics and bioinformatics methods were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of EESMS. RESULTS: EESMS treatment inhibited HeLa cell proliferation by blocking the G0/G1 phase, increasing the expression of Caspase-3 and affecting its mechanical properties, and the EESMS indicated no significant inhibitory effect on mouse fibroblasts L929 cell line. In total, 218 differentially expressed proteins were identified using two-dimensional electrophoresis, and eight differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The differentially expressed proteins were involved in various cellular and biological processes. CONCLUSION: This study provides a perspective on how cells change through biomechanics and a further theoretical foundation for the future application of Sophora moorcroftiana as a novel low-toxicity chemotherapy medication for treating human cervical cancer."
38831273,Circulating free insulin-like growth factor-I and prostate cancer: a case-control study nested in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition.,"BACKGROUND: Circulating total insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is an established risk factor for prostate cancer. However, only a small proportion of circulating IGF-I is free or readily dissociable from IGF-binding proteins (its bioavailable form), and few studies have investigated the association of circulating free IGF-I with prostate cancer risk. METHODS: We analyzed data from 767 prostate cancer cases and 767 matched controls nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, with an average of 14-years (interquartile range = 2.9) follow-up. Matching variables were study center, length of follow-up, age, and time of day and fasting duration at blood collection. Circulating free IGF-I concentration was measured in serum samples collected at recruitment visit (mean age 55 years old; standard deviation = 7.1) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Conditional logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations of free IGF-I with risk of prostate cancer overall and subdivided by time to diagnosis (</= 14 and > 14 years), and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: Circulating free IGF-I concentrations (in fourths and as a continuous variable) were not associated with prostate cancer risk overall (odds ratio [OR] = 1.00 per 0.1 nmol/L increment, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.02) or by time to diagnosis, or with prostate cancer subtypes, including tumor stage and histological grade. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated circulating free IGF-I was not associated with prostate cancer risk. Further research may consider other assay methods that estimate bioavailable IGF-I to provide more insight into the well-substantiated association between circulating total IGF-I and subsequent prostate cancer risk."
38830975,STEAP2 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via increased copper levels and stress-activated MAP kinase activity.,"Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 2 (STEAP2) belongs to a family of metalloreductases, which indirectly aid in uptake of iron and copper ions. Its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be characterized. Here, we report that STEAP2 expression was upregulated in HCC tumors compared with paired adjacent non-tumor tissues by RNA sequencing, RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Public HCC datasets demonstrated upregulated STEAP2 expression in HCC and positive association with tumor grade. Transient and stable knockdown (KD) of STEAP2 in HCC cell lines abrogated their malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, while STEAP2 overexpression showed opposite effects. STEAP2 KD in HCC cells led to significant alteration of genes associated with extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion/chemotaxis, negative enrichment of an invasiveness signature gene set, and inhibition of cell migration/invasion. STEAP2 KD reduced intracellular copper levels and activation of stress-activated MAP kinases including p38 and JNK. Treatment with copper rescued the reduced HCC cell migration due to STEAP2 KD and activated p38 and JNK. Furthermore, treatment with p38 or JNK inhibitors significantly inhibited copper-mediated cell migration. Thus, STEAP2 plays a malignant-promoting role in HCC cells by driving migration/invasion via increased copper levels and MAP kinase activities. Our study uncovered a novel molecular mechanism contributing to HCC malignancy and a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment."
38829686,DUX4 is a common driver of immune evasion and immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers.,"Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-gamma signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance."
38826391,"A Peptide Derived from Sorting Nexin 1 Inhibits HPV16 Entry, Retrograde Trafficking, and L2 Membrane Spanning.","High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for 99% of cervical cancers and 5% of all human cancers worldwide. HPV infection requires the viral genome (vDNA) to gain access to nuclei of basal keratinocytes of epithelium. After virion endocytosis, the minor capsid protein L2 dictates the subcellular retrograde trafficking and nuclear localization of the vDNA during mitosis. Prior work identified a cell-permeable peptide termed SNX1.3, derived from the BAR domain of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), that potently blocks the retrograde and nuclear trafficking of EGFR in triple negative breast cancer cells. Given the importance of EGFR and retrograde trafficking pathways in HPV16 infection, we set forth to study the effects of SNX1.3 within this context. SNX1.3 inhibited HPV16 infection by both delaying virion endocytosis, as well as potently blocking virion retrograde trafficking and Golgi localization. SNX1.3 had no effect on cell proliferation, nor did it affect post-Golgi trafficking of HPV16. Looking more directly at L2 function, SNX1.3 was found to impair membrane spanning of the minor capsid protein. Future work will focus on mechanistic studies of SNX1.3 inhibition, and the role of EGFR signaling and SNX1- mediated endosomal tubulation, cargo sorting, and retrograde trafficking in HPV infection."
38825615,Predicting prostate adenocarcinoma patients' survival and immune signature: a novel risk model based on telomere-related genes.,"Alterations in telomeres constitute some of the earliest occurrences in the tumourigenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and persist throughout the progression of the tumour. While the activity of telomerase and the length of telomeres have been demonstrated to correlate with the prognosis of PRAD, the prognostic potential of telomere-related genes (TRGs) in this disease remains unexplored. Utilising mRNA expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we devised a risk model and a nomogram to predict the survival outcomes of patients with PRAD. Subsequently, our investigations extended to the relationship between the risk model and immune cell infiltration, sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and specific signalling pathways. The risk model we developed is predicated on seven key TRGs, and immunohistochemistry results revealed significant differential expression of three TRGs in tumours and paracancerous tissues. Based on the risk scores, PRAD patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk cohorts. The Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses corroborated the exceptional predictive performance of our novel risk model. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the risk score was an independent risk factor associated with Overall Survival (OS) and was significantly associated with T and N stages of PRAD patients. Notably, the high-risk group exhibited a greater response to chemotherapy and immunosuppression compared to the low-risk group, offering potential guidance for treatment strategies for high-risk patients. In conclusion, our new risk model, based on TRGs, serves as a reliable prognostic indicator for PRAD. The model holds significant value in guiding the selection of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in the clinical management of PRAD patients."
38824236,2-Deoxy-D-Glucose Downregulates Fatty Acid Synthase Gene Expression Via an Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Dependent Pathway in HeLa Cells.,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of cellular lipogenesis. FASN expression is upregulated in various types of cancer cells, implying that FASN is a potential target for cancer therapy. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) specifically targets cancer cells by inhibiting glycolysis and glucose metabolism, resulting in multiple anticancer effects. However, whether the effects of 2-DG involve lipogenic metabolism remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of 2-DG administration on FASN expression in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. 2-DG treatment for 24 h decreased FASN mRNA and protein levels and suppressed the activity of an exogenous rat Fasn promoter. The use of a chemical activator or inhibitors or of a mammalian expression plasmid showed that neither AMPK nor the Sp1 transcription factor is responsible for the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on FASN expression. Administration of thapsigargin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer, or 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), a site 1 protease inhibitor, mimicked the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on FASN expression. 2-DG did not further decrease FASN expression in the presence of thapsigargin or AEBSF. Site 1 protease mediates activation of ATF6, an ER stress mediator, as well as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a robust transcription factor for FASN. Administration of 2-DG or thapsigargin for 24 h suppressed activation of ATF6 and SREBP1, as did AEBSF. We speculated that these effects of 2-DG or thapsigargin are due to feedback inhibition via increased GRP78 expression following ER stress. Supporting this, exogenous overexpression of GRP78 in HeLa cells suppressed SREBP1 activation and Fasn promoter activity. These results suggest that 2-DG suppresses FASN expression via an ER stress-dependent pathway, providing new insight into the molecular basis of FASN regulation in cancer."
38824003,Circulating Biomarkers Predictive of Treatment Response in Patients with Hormone-sensitive or Castration-resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) harbors genomic alterations that may predict targeted therapy efficacy. These alterations can be identified not only in tissue but also directly in biologic fluids (ie, liquid biopsies), mainly blood. Liquid biopsies may represent a safer and less invasive alternative for monitoring patients treated for mPCa. Current research focuses on the description and validation of novel predictive biomarkers to improve precision medicine in mPCa. Our aim was to systematically review the current evidence on liquid biopsy biomarkers for predicting treatment response in mPCa. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Web of Science, and evidence-based websites for publications on circulating biomarkers in mPCa between March 2013 and February 2024 for review. Endpoints were: prediction of overall survival, biochemical or radiographic progression-free survival after treatment (chemotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, androgen receptor pathway inhibitors [ARPIs], immunotherapy, or PARP inhibitors [PARPIs]). For each biomarker, the level of evidence (LOE) for clinical validity was attributed: LOE IA and IB, high level of evidence; LOE IIB and IIC, intermediate level; and LOE IIIC and LOE IV-VD, weak level. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The predictive value of each biomarker for the response to several therapies was evaluated in both metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In patients with mCRPC, BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations predicted response to ARPIs (LOE IB) and PARPIs (LOE IIB), while AR-V7 transcripts or AR-V7 protein levels in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) predicted response to ARPIs and taxanes (LOE IB). CTC quantification predicted response to cabazitaxel, abiraterone, and radium-223 (LOE IIB), while TP53 alterations predicted response to (177)Lu prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand treatment (LOE IIB). AR copy number in circulating tumor DNA before the first treatment line and before subsequent lines predicted response to docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and ARPIs (LOE IIB). In mHSPC, DNA damage in lymphocytes was predictive of the response to radium-223 (LOE IIB). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: BRCA1/2, ATM, and AR alterations detected in liquid biopsies may help clinicians in management of patients with mPCa. The other circulating biomarkers did not reach the LOE required for routine clinical use and should be validated in prospective independent studies. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed studies assessing the value of biomarkers in blood or urine for management of metastatic prostate cancer. The evidence indicates that some biomarkers could help in selecting patients eligible for specific treatments."
38822303,"Causal relationship between lipid-lowering drugs and ovarian cancer, cervical cancer: a drug target mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: The causal impact of lipid-lowering drugs on ovarian cancer (OC) and cervical cancer (CC) has received considerable attention, but its causal relationship is still a subject of debate. Hence, the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of lipid-lowering medications on the occurrence risk of OC and CC through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of drug targets. METHODS: This investigation concentrated on the primary targets of lipid-lowering medications, specifically, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and proprotein convertase kexin 9 (PCSK9). Genetic variations associated with HMGCR and PCSK9 were derived from published genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings to serve as substitutes for HMGCR and PCSK9 inhibitors. Employing a MR approach, an analysis was conducted to scrutinize the impact of inhibitors targeting HMGCR and PCSK9 on the occurrence of OC and CC. Coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was utilized as a positive control, and the primary outcomes encompassed OC and CC. RESULTS: The findings of the study suggest a notable elevation in the risk of OC among patients treated with HMGCR inhibitors (OR [95%CI] = 1.815 [1.316, 2.315], p = 0.019). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed between PCSK9 inhibitors and the occurrence of OC. Additionally, the analysis did not reveal any noteworthy connection between HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors, and CC. CONCLUSION: HMGCR inhibitors significantly elevate the risk of OC in patients, but their mechanism needs further investigation, and no influence of PCSK9 inhibitors on OC has been observed. There is no significant relationship between HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors, and CC."
38821639,Molecular Pathology of Prostate Cancer.,"Molecular profiling studies have shed new light on the complex biology of prostate cancer. Genomic studies have highlighted that structural rearrangements are among the most common recurrent alterations. In addition, both germline and somatic mutations in DNA repair genes are enriched in patients with advanced disease. Primary prostate cancer has long been known to be multifocal, but recent studies demonstrate that a large fraction of prostate cancer shows evidence of multiclonality, suggesting that genetically distinct, independently arising tumor clones coexist. Metastatic prostate cancer shows a high level of morphologic and molecular diversity, which is associated with resistance to systemic therapies. The resulting high level of intratumoral heterogeneity has important implications for diagnosis and poses major challenges for the implementation of molecular studies. Here we provide a concise review of the molecular pathology of prostate cancer, highlight clinically relevant alterations, and discuss opportunities for molecular testing."
38821589,High Level Immunoglobulin Gene Expression and Reduced Intra-tumoral Bacteria Associated With the Transition from Initial to Progressive Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: In the past decade, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), the most common childhood brainstem glioma, has benefitted from an increase in tissue-based research because of improved biopsy collection techniques. However, the adaptive immune receptor (IR) features represented by tumor material and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have remained poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we characterized the adaptive immune parameters of DIPG through the recovery of IR recombination reads from RNAseq files representing initial and progressive DIPG samples. RESULTS: An elevated level of immunoglobulin gene expression in the progressive DIPG sample files and a reduced number of bacterial sequencing read recoveries in comparison to RNAseq files representing the initial form of DIPG, was found. Furthermore, the RNAseq files representing both initial and progressive DIPG samples had significant numbers of reads representing Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium previously linked to prostate cancer development. Results also indicated an opportunity to distinguish overall survival probabilities based on IGL complementarity determining region-3 amino acid sequence physicochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: Genomics analyses allow for a better understanding of adaptive IR features and bacterial infections in the DIPG setting."
38820761,Accurate detection of copy number aberrations in FFPE samples using the mFAST-SeqS approach.,"BACKGROUND: Shallow whole genome sequencing (Shallow-seq) is used to determine the copy number aberrations (CNA) in tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA. However, costs of NGS and challenges of small biopsies ask for an alternative to the untargeted NGS approaches. The mFAST-SeqS approach, relying on LINE-1 repeat amplification, showed a good correlation with Shallow-seq to detect CNA in blood samples. In the present study, we evaluated whether mFAST-SeqS is suitable to assess CNA in small formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, using vulva and anal HPV-related lesions. METHODS: Seventy-two FFPE samples, including 36 control samples (19 vulva;17 anal) for threshold setting and 36 samples (24 vulva; 12 anal) for clinical evaluation, were analyzed by mFAST-SeqS. CNA in vulva and anal lesions were determined by calculating genome-wide and chromosome arm-specific z-scores in comparison with the respective control samples. Sixteen samples were also analyzed with the conventional Shallow-seq approach. RESULTS: Genome-wide z-scores increased with the severity of disease, with highest values being found in cancers. In vulva samples median and inter quartile ranges [IQR] were 1[0-2] in normal tissues (n = 4), 3[1-7] in premalignant lesions (n = 9) and 21[13-48] in cancers (n = 10). In anal samples, median [IQR] were 0[0-1] in normal tissues (n = 4), 14[6-38] in premalignant lesions (n = 4) and 18[9-31] in cancers (n = 4). At threshold 4, all controls were CNA negative, while 8/13 premalignant lesions and 12/14 cancers were CNA positive. CNA captured by mFAST-SeqS were mostly also found by Shallow-seq. CONCLUSION: mFAST-SeqS is easy to perform, requires less DNA and less sequencing reads reducing costs, thereby providing a good alternative for Shallow-seq to determine CNA in small FFPE samples."
38819099,A case of metastatic HPV-related cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with varying cytomorphology found in cytological specimens of a solid organ transplant recipient.,"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the cervix is a rare gynecological malignancy, constituting 2%-5% of all such cases. As high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HR-HPV) infections contribute to 85% of these tumors, small cell NEC poses a significant risk for solid organ transplant recipients, increasing their risk of progressive disease. We present a case of an uterine cervix small cell NEC with metastasis to the bladder and pleural cavities in a 53-year-old woman with a past medical history of kidney transplantation, who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. The initial liquid preparation (ThinPrep) cytology stained with Papanicolaou (Pap) showed an adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified. At the time of diagnosis, the patient had diffusely metastatic disease. A subsequent uterine cervix biopsy was consistent with a small cell NEC. Despite treatment with chemotherapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, evidenced by a worsening right-sided pleural effusion one-month postdiagnosis. A pleural effusion showed a tumor with glandular features, with immunohistochemistry suggestive of metastatic adenocarcinoma. HR HPV E6/E7 RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) was positive. Bladder washing showed cytopathologic findings consistent with bladder involvement by small cell carcinoma. The patient's lesions in both urine and pleural fluids showed distinct cytomorphology. Within a year of diagnosis, the patient was declared deceased. This case highlights the existence of carcinoma admixed with NEC tumor, such as an HPV associated adenocarcinoma admixed with a NEC and underscores the elevated risk of HPV-related genital lesions in renal transplant patients. In patients with a history of solid organ transplant or other immunosuppressive conditions, there is an increased necessity for enhanced surveillance and appropriate cancer screening."
38818922,Identification and validation of the TRHDE-AS1/hsa-miR-449a/ADAMTS5 axis as a novel prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.,"Despite advancements in cancer research, the prognostic implications of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks in prostate cancer (PCa) remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the prognostic relevance of ceRNA networks in PCa, utilizing a comprehensive bioinformatics approach alongside experimental validation. After searching The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data were extracted to identify differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) between 491 PCa samples and 51 normal prostate tissues, following which a comprehensive bioinformatics strategy was implemented to construct a ceRNA network. An optimal prognostic signature comprising these DERs was then established and validated using TCGA data. In addition, functional validation was performed through RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase reporter assays, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot analysis conducted in PC-3 and DU145 cell lines, thereby complementing the bioinformatics analysis. A total of 613 DERs, comprising 103 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 60 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 450 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), were identified and utilized in constructing a ceRNA network, which encompassed 23 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 52 mRNAs. An optimal prognostic signature was established, including VPS9D1 antisense RNA 1 (VPS9D1-AS1), miR-449a, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1 (CDK5R1), targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), copine7 (CPNE7), and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), yielding area under the curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.8 across training, validation, and entire datasets. Our experiments results revealed an interaction between lncRNA TRHDE antisense RNA 1 (TRHDE-AS1) and miR-449a and that miR-449a could target the ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) mRNA. Knockdown of miR-449a significantly impeded cell proliferation, G1/S transition, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of miR-449a notably downregulated protein expression of CDK4, cyclin D1, N-cadherin and vimentin, while upregulating protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and E-cadherin. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the prognostic-linked ceRNA network in PCa, providing fundamental insights that could improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for PCa management."
38818897,JMJD2A promotes the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer by activating androgen receptor enhancer and inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway.,"Exploring targets for inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) activity is an effective strategy for suppressing the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Upregulation of histone demethylase JMJD2A activity is an important factor in increasing AR expression in CRPC. Based on our research, we found that the binding affinity between JMJD2A and AR increases in CRPC, while the level of AR histone methylation decreases and the H3K27ac level increases in the AR enhancer region. Further investigations revealed that overexpression of the histone demethylase JMJD2A increased the binding affinity between JMJD2A and AR, decreased AR histone methylation levels, upregulated H3K27ac in the AR enhancer region, and increased AR activity. Conversely, knocking down JMJD2A effectively reversed these effects. Additionally, in CRPC, JMJD2A expression was upregulated, the tumor-intrinsic immune cGAS-STING signaling pathway was suppressed, the tumor microenvironment was altered, and AR expression was upregulated. However, both knocking down JMJD2A and inhibiting the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway reversed these effects. In summary, our study indicates that in CRPC, JMJD2A can directly bind to AR and activate residual AR enhancers through its demethylation activity, thereby promoting AR expression. Furthermore, upregulation of JMJD2A expression inhibits the innate immune cGAS-STING signaling pathway of the tumor, leading to a decrease in antitumor immune function, and further promoting AR expression."
38818762,Single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing reveals mitosis-involved gene HAUS1 is a promising indicator for predicting prognosis and immune responses in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD).,"It was imperative to identify latent biomarkers pertinent to malignancies, given the pivotal role targeted molecular therapies play in tumor treatment investigations. This study aimed to assess the validity of HAUS1 as an indicator for survival prognosis and immune responses in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) via single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing. Related data on HAUS1 expression in PRAD were obtained from online databases, followed by comprehensive analyses to delineate its associations with survival prognosis, implicated pathways, and immune responses. Besides, the expression pattern of HAUS1 in PRAD was also verified in vitro, by using qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. We found HAUS1 was downregulated in PRAD compared with normal tissues, as verified in vitro by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (p < 0.05). Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that HAUS1 had relatively higher expressions in B cells, Mono/Macro cells, and Endothelial cells compared with other cell types. Cox regression analysis revealed HAUS1 could serve as an independent indicator for the overall survival prognosis of PRAD (p < 0.05). Spearman correlation analyses revealed HAUS1 was closely related to the tumor microenvironment, immune cell infiltration levels, immune checkpoints, and immune cell pathways (p < 0.05). Furthermore, HAUS1 expression was found to be closely related to the immunotherapeutic response of patients receiving clinical intervention (p < 0.05). Collectively, our findings underscored the significant role of HAUS1 in PRAD prognosis and immune response, thereby presenting a novel and promising avenue for investigating the clinical utility of immunotherapy in PRAD."
38816694,Genetic association of Interleukin-17A polymorphism in Bangladeshi patients with breast and cervical cancer: a case-control study with functional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Breast and cervical cancer are the two leading cancers in terms of incidence and mortality. Previous studies reported different interleukins, including interleukin-17A (IL-17A) to be responsible for the development and progression of these malignancies. Therefore, we speculated that the variants in this gene might be associated with these cancer developments in Bangladeshi population. For evaluating the hypothesis, we investigated the association of IL-17A rs3748067 polymorphism with the susceptibility of both breast and cervical cancer. METHODS: This case-control study was performed on 156 breast cancer patients, 156 cervical cancer patients, and 156 controls using the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. The statistical software package SPSS (version 25.0) was applied for analyses. The genetic association was measured by the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A statistically significant association was considered when p-value </= 0.05. Functional analysis was performed using GEPIA and UALCAN databases. RESULTS: From the calculation of the association of IL-17A rs3748067 with breast cancer, it is found that no genotype or allele showed a statistically significant association (p>0.05). On the other hand, the analysis of IL-17A rs3748067 with cervical cancer demonstrated that CT genotype showed a significant association (CT vs. CC: OR=1.79, p=0.021). In the overdominant model, CT genotype also revealed a statistically significant association with cervical cancer, which is found to be statistically significant (OR=1.84, p=0.015). CONCLUSION: Our study summarizes that rs3748067 polymorphism in the IL-17A gene may be associated with cervical cancer but not breast cancer in Bangladeshi patients. However, we suggest studies in the future with a larger sample size."
38809685,METTL3's role in cervical cancer development through m(6)A modification.,"N6-methylated adenosine (m(6)A) is a crucial RNA modification in eukaryotes, particularly in cancer. However, its role in cervical cancer (CC) is unclear. We aimed to elucidate the part of m(6)A in CC by analyzing methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) expression, identifying downstream targets, and exploring the underlying mechanism. We assessed METTL3 expression in CC using western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and immunohistochemistry. In vitro and in vivo experiments examined METTL3's role in CC. We employed RNA sequencing, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, qPCR, and RNA immunoprecipitation qPCR to explore METTL3's mechanism in CC. METTL3 expression was upregulated in CC, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. METTL3 knockdown inhibited human cervical cancer by inactivating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. METTL3-mediated m(6)A modification was observed in CC cells, targeting phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A). METTL3 catalyzed m(6)A modification on PDE3A mRNA through YTH domain family protein 3 (YTHDF3). Our study indicated the mechanism of m(6)A modification in CC and suggested the METTL3/YTHDF3/PDE3A axis as a potential clinical target for CC treatment."
38808547,Genetic variation of circHIBADH enhances prostate cancer risk through regulating HNRNPA1-related RNA splicing.,"The current study aimed to investigate associations of circRNAs and related genetic variants with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) as well as to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying the associations. We first compared expression levels of circRNAs between 25 paired PCa and adjacent normal tissues to identify risk-associated circRNAs by using the MiOncoCirc database. We then used logistic regression models to evaluate associations between genetic variants in candidate circRNAs and PCa risk among 4662 prostate cancer patients and 3114 healthy controls, and identified circHIBADH rs11973492 T>C as a significant risk-associated variant (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.34, P = 7.06 x 10 (-4)) in a dominant genetic model, which altered the secondary structure of the corresponding RNA chain. In the in silico analysis, we found that circHIBADH sponged and silenced 21 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) enriched in the RNA splicing pathway, among which HNRNPA1 was identified and validated as a hub RBP using an external RNA-sequencing data as well as the in-house (four tissue samples) and publicly available single-cell transcriptomes. Additionally, we demonstrated that HNRNPA1 influenced hallmarks including MYC target, DNA repair, and E2F target signaling pathways, thereby promoting carcinogenesis. In conclusion, genetic variants in circHIBADH may act as sponges and inhibitors of RNA splicing-associated RBPs including HNRNPA1, playing an oncogenic role in PCa."
38808339,"Treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer and de novo neuroendocrine prostate cancer: Identification, prognosis and survival, genetic and epigenetic factors.","Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) shows an aggressive behavior compared to prostate cancer (PCa), also known as prostate adenocarcinoma. Scanty foci in PCa can harbor genetic alternation that can arise in a heterogeneity of prostate cancer. NEPC may arise de novo or develop following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). NEPC that arise following ADT has the nomenclature ""treatment-emerging/induced NEPC (t-NEPC)"". t-NEPC would be anticipated in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and metastatic PCa. t-NEPC is characterized by low or absent androgen receptor (AR) expression, independence of AR signaling, and gain of neuroendocrine phenotype. t-NEPC is an aggressive metastatic tumor, develops from PCa in response to drug induced ADT, and shows very short response to conventional therapy. t-NEPC occurs in 10%-17% of patients with CRPC. De novo NEPC is rare and is accounting for less than 2% of all PCa. The molecular mechanisms underlying the trans-differentiation from CRPC to t-NEPC are not fully elucidated. Sphingosine kinase 1 plays a significant role in t-NEPC development. Although neuroendocrine markers: Synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and insulinoma associated protein 1 (INSM1) are expressed in t-NEPC, they are non-specific for diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of therapy. t-NEPC shows enriched genomic alteration in tumor protein P53 (TP53) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). There are evidences suggest that t-NEPC might develop through epigenetic evolution. There are genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptional alterations that are reported to be involved in development of t-NEPC. Knock-outs of TP53 and RB1 were found to contribute in development of t-NEPC. PCa is resistant to immunotherapy, and at present there are running trials to approach immunotherapy for PCa, CRPC, and t-NEPC."
38800978,Causal effects of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy on future gynecologic tumors: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous observational studies have investigated the potential link between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) and the subsequent risks of gynecologic tumors, yet the findings have been inconsistent. In this study, we utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to assess the influence of HDPs on the future risks of ovarian, cervical, endometrial, and breast cancer and uterine fibroids, controlling for confounding factors. METHODS: The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data relevant to HDPs was obtained from the FinnGen databases (10,736 cases and 136,325 controls). Gynecologic tumor outcomes were extracted from the IEU Open GWAS project and UK Biobank (47,690 cases and 1, 092,073 controls). The inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach was selected as the principal method for MR analysis, supplemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted model, simple model methods, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test, and leave-one-out method. Multivariate MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted after adjusting systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESULTS: Our univariate MR analysis (UVMR) results revealed no significant relationship between HDPs and the risks of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.924, p = 0.360), cervical cancer (OR = 1.230, p = 0.738), endometrial cancer (OR = 1.006, p = 0.949), uterine fibroids (OR = 1.155, p = 0.158), and breast cancer (OR = 0.792, p = 0.241) by IVW test. Similar results were observed in gestational hypertension and preeclampsia/eclampsia. Additionally, our study detected neither heterogeneity nor pleiotropy. MVMR analysis also provided no evidence of a causal association between HDPs and common gynecologic tumors after adjusting SBP, BMI, and T2DM. CONCLUSION: We discovered no causal relationship between HDPs and ovarian, cervical, endometrial, breast cancer, and uterine fibroids in European populations. However, present analysis did not explore the effect of HDPs on the subtypes of gynecologic tumors across varied ethnic populations, which may require additional research."
38800011,Comprehensive analysis of autophagy associated genes and immune infiltrates in cervical cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common gynecological malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women. The progression of CC is significantly affected by autophagy. Our objective was to use bioinformatics analysis to explore the expression, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration of autophagy-related genes in CC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a set of autophagy-related differentially expressed genes (ARDEGs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. ARDEGs were further validated by The Human Protein Atlas (HPA), GSE52903, and GSE39001 dataset. Hub genes were found by the STRING network and Cytoscape. We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene ontology analysis (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and immune infiltration analysis to further understand the functions of the hub genes. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to check the hub genes. RESULTS: A total of 10 up-regulated (CXCR4, BAX, SPHK1, EIF2AK2, TBK1, TNFSF10, ITGB4, CDKN2A, IL24, and BIRC5) and 19 down-regulated (PINK1, ATG16L2, ATG4D, IKBKE, MLST8, MAPK3, ERBB2, ULK3, TP53INP2, MTMR14, BNIP3, FOS, CCL2, FAS, CAPNS1, HSPB8, PTK6, FKBP1B , and DNAJB1) ARDEGs were identified. The ARDEGs were enriched in cell growth, apoptosis, human papillomavirus infection, and cytokine-mediated. Then, we found that low expression of MAPK3 was associated with poor prognosis in CC patients and was significantly enriched in immune pathways. In addition, the expression of MAPK3 was significantly positively correlated with the infiltration levels of macrophages, B cells, mast cell activation, and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Furthermore, MAPK3 was positively correlated with LGALS9, and negatively correlated with CTLA4 and CD40. CONCLUSION: Our results show that MAPK3 can be used as a new prognostic biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with CC."
38798471,Androgen receptor activity inversely correlates with immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy response across multiple cancer lineages.,"There is now increasing recognition of the important role of androgen receptor (AR) in modulating immune function. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of AR activity on cancer immunity, we employed a computational approach to profile AR activity in 33 human tumor types using RNA-Seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our pan-cancer analysis revealed that the genes most negatively correlated with AR activity across cancers are involved in active immune system processes. Importantly, we observed a significant negative correlation between AR activity and IFNgamma pathway activity at the pan-cancer level. Indeed, using a matched biopsy dataset from subjects with prostate cancer before and after AR-targeted treatment, we verified that inhibiting AR enriches immune cell abundances and is associated with higher IFNgamma pathway activity. Furthermore, by analyzing immunotherapy datasets in multiple cancers, our results demonstrate that low AR activity was significantly associated with a favorable response to immunotherapy. Together, our data provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between AR signaling and tumor immunity."
38795832,Utilization of a Third-party Partnership in Tele-genetic Risk Assessment Program in Genitourinary Oncology.,"OBJECTIVE: To meet the increasing demands of genetic risk assessment for genitourinary cancers due to expanded clinical guidelines, we established an academic/industry partnership to create a streamlined workflow to overcome the barriers to access to care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genome Medical offers multilingual genetic counseling. A pilot program evaluated patients at risk for hereditary genitourinary syndromes. Between January 1, 2020 and January 07, 2022, all patients in need of germline testing were offered hybrid in-clinic telehealth pre-test counseling and when indicated, genetic testing. Post-test counseling was offered based on results and encouraged if positive. Testing results, patient satisfaction, and costs were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 146 of 182 (80.0%) patients agreed to participate, with 130 (89.0%) completing pre-test counseling. Median age was 65 (range 22-95), with 91% being male and approximately 60% having prostate cancer. The median time from referral to pre-test counseling was 11 days (IQR 7-20). After assessment, testing was recommended for 127 (97.7%) of which 123 (96.8%) completed testing. The median time from testing to result release was 15 days (IQR 10-20.8). Forty (32.5%) had post-test counseling. Reimbursement by private insurers increased annually from $17.2 to $52.4. Patient satisfaction was high with a mean Genetic Counselor Satisfaction Scale of 27.9 out of 30. CONCLUSION: Our program provided high patient satisfaction, rapid access to genetic counseling, prompt genetic testing, timely release of results, and was cost-effective compared to traditional models. This approach is scalable across community and academic settings and across cancer types."
38793044,Advancements in the Understanding of Small-Cell Neuroendocrine Cervical Cancer: Where We Stand and What Lies Ahead.,"Small-cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma (SCNCC) is a rare yet aggressive gynecological malignancy associated with dismal clinical outcomes. Its rarity has led to a limited number of retrospective studies and an absence of prospective research, posing significant challenges for evidence-based treatment approaches. As a result, most gynecologic oncology centers have limited experience with this tumor, emphasizing the urgent need for a comprehensive review and summary. This article systematically reviews the pathogenesis, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics, prognostic factors, and clinical management of gynecologic SCNCC. We specifically focused on reviewing the distinct genomic characteristics of SCNCC identified via next-generation sequencing technologies, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), somatic mutations, structural variations (SVs), and microRNA alterations. The identification of these actionable genomic events offers promise for discovering new molecular targets for drug development and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, we delve deeper into key clinical challenges, such as determining the optimal treatment modality between chemoradiation and surgery for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I phase patients within a precision stratification framework, as well as the role of targeted therapy within the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in the management of SCNCC. Finally, we anticipate the utilization of multiple SCNCC models, including cancer tissue-originated spheroid (CTOS) lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), to decipher driver events and develop individualized therapeutic strategies for clinical application."
38792020,Epigenetics Meets CAR-T-Cell Therapy to Fight Cancer.,"Based on the impressive success of Car-T-cell therapy in the treatment of hematological malignancies, a broad application for solid tumors also appears promising. However, some important hurdles need to be overcome. One of these is certainly the identification of specific target antigens on cancer cells. Hypomethylation is a characteristic epigenetic aberration in many tumor entities. Genome-wide screenings for consistent DNA hypomethylations in tumors enable the identification of aberrantly upregulated transcripts, which might result in cell surface proteins. Thus, this approach provides a new perspective for the discovery of potential new Car-T-cell target antigens for almost every tumor entity. First, we focus on this approach as a possible treatment for prostate cancer."
38791967,"""Oh, Dear We Are in Tribble"": An Overview of the Oncogenic Functions of Tribbles 1.","Pseudokinases are catalytically inactive proteins in the human genome that lack the ability to transfer phosphate from ATP to their substrates. The Tribbles family of pseudokinases contains three members: Tribbles 1, 2, and 3. Tribbles 1 has recently gained importance because of its involvement in various diseases, including cancer. It acts as a scaffolding protein that brings about the degradation of its substrate proteins, such as C/EBPalpha/beta, MLXIPL, and RAR/RXRalpha, among others, via the ubiquitin proteasome system. It also serves as an adapter protein, which sequesters different protein molecules and activates their downstream signaling, leading to processes, such as cell survival, cell proliferation, and lipid metabolism. It has been implicated in cancers such as AML, prostate cancer, breast cancer, CRC, HCC, and glioma, where it activates oncogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT and MAPK and inhibits the anti-tumor function of p53. TRIB1 also causes treatment resistance in cancers such as NSCLC, breast cancer, glioma, and promyelocytic leukemia. All these effects make TRIB1 a potential drug target. However, the lack of a catalytic domain renders TRIB1 ""undruggable"", but knowledge about its structure, conformational changes during substrate binding, and substrate binding sites provides an opportunity to design small-molecule inhibitors against specific TRIB1 interactions."
38791950,Histologically Overt Stromal Response and the Risk of Progression after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Given the variable clinical course of prostate cancer and the limitations of current prognostic factors, this study was conducted to investigate the impact of a histologically overt stromal response (HOST-response) to prostate cancer on clinical outcomes after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: This retrospective analysis utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate data from individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy and had available pathology slides. These slides were assessed for the presence of a HOST-response, similar to desmoplasia. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). A multivariable competing risk regression analysis was used to assess whether a significant association existed between HOST-response and PFS, adjusting for known prostate cancer prognostic factors. RESULTS: Among the 348 patients analyzed, 166 (47.70%) demonstrated a HOST-response. After a median follow-up of 37.87 months (IQR: 21.20, 65.50), the presence of a HOST-response was significantly associated with a shorter PFS (SDHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.26 to 3.50; p = 0.004), after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: HOST-response in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy is significantly associated with reduced PFS, suggesting a potential benefit from adjuvant therapy and highlighting the need for further investigation in a prospective randomized clinical trial."
38791418,Anticancer Effects of the Novel Pyrazolyl-Urea GeGe-3.,"In a screen of over 200 novel pyrazole compounds, ethyl 1-(2-hydroxypentyl)-5-(3-(3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl)ureido)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate (named GeGe-3) has emerged as a potential anticancer compound. GeGe-3 displays potent anti-angiogenic properties through the presumptive targeting of the protein kinase DMPK1 and the Ca2(+)-binding protein calreticulin. We further explored the anticancer potential of GeGe-3 on a range of established cancer cell lines, including PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma), SKMEL-28 (cutaneous melanoma), SKOV-3 (ovarian adenocarcinoma), Hep-G2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MDA-MB231, SKBR3, MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma), A549 (lung carcinoma), and HeLa (cervix epithelioid carcinoma). At concentrations in the range of 10 muM, GeGe-3 significantly restricted cell proliferation and metabolism. GeGe-3 also reduced PC3 cell migration in a standard wound closure and trans-well assay. Together, these results confirm the anticancer potential of GeGe-3 and underline the need for more detailed pre-clinical investigations into its molecular targets and mechanisms of action."
38791417,Radiogenomics Map-Based Molecular and Imaging Phenotypical Characterization in Localised Prostate Cancer Using Pre-Biopsy Biparametric MR Imaging.,"To create a radiogenomics map and evaluate the correlation between molecular and imaging phenotypes in localized prostate cancer (PCa), using radical prostatectomy histopathology as a reference standard. Radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2WI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) images of clinically localized PCa patients (n = 15) across different Gleason score-based risk categories. DNA extraction was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Gene expression analysis of androgen receptor expression, apoptosis, and hypoxia was conducted using the Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) application and OSCHIP files. The relationship between gene expression alterations and textural features was assessed using Pearson's correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was utilized to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model. A significant correlation was observed between radiomic texture features and copy number variation (CNV) of genes associated with apoptosis, hypoxia, and androgen receptor (p-value </= 0.05). The identified radiomic features, including Sum Entropy ADC, Inverse Difference ADC, Sum Variance T2WI, Entropy T2WI, Difference Variance T2WI, and Angular Secondary Moment T2WI, exhibited potential for predicting cancer grade and biological processes such as apoptosis and hypoxia. Incorporating radiomics and genomics into a prediction model significantly improved the prediction of prostate cancer grade (clinically significant prostate cancer), yielding an AUC of 0.95. Radiomic texture features significantly correlate with genotypes for apoptosis, hypoxia, and androgen receptor expression in localised prostate cancer. Integration of these into the prediction model improved prediction accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer."

The field of omics has recently gained traction due to its capacity to provide profound insights into the biochemical mechanisms underlying conditions like prostate cancer. This involves the identification and quantification of low-molecular-weight metabolites and proteins acting as crucial biochemical signals for early detection, therapy assessment, and target identification. A spectrum of analytical methods is employed to discern and measure these molecules, revealing their altered biological pathways within diseased contexts. Metabolomics and proteomics generate refined data subjected to detailed statistical analysis through sophisticated software, yielding substantive insights. This review aims to underscore the major contributions of multi-omics to PCa research, covering its core principles, its role in tumor biology characterization, biomarker discovery, prognostic studies, various analytical technologies such as mass spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, data processing, and recent clinical applications made possible by an integrative ""omics"" approach. This approach seeks to address the challenges associated with current PCa treatments. Hence, our research endeavors to demonstrate the valuable applications of these potent tools in investigations, offering significant potential for understanding the complex biochemical environment of prostate cancer and advancing tailored therapeutic approaches for further development."
38790213,Evaluation of miR-148a-3p and miR-106a-5p as Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer: Pilot Study.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that may function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Alteration of their expression levels has been linked to a range of human malignancies, including cancer. The objective of this investigation is to assess the relative expression levels of certain miRNAs to distinguish between prostate cancer (PCa) from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Blood plasma was collected from 66 patients diagnosed with BPH and 58 patients with PCa. Real-time PCR technology was used to evaluate the relative expression among the two groups for miR-106a-5p and miR-148a-3p. The significant downregulation of both miRNAs in plasma from PCa versus BPH patients suggests their potential utility as diagnostic biomarkers for distinguishing between these conditions. The concurrent utilization of these two miRNAs slightly enhanced the sensitivity for discrimination among the two analyzed groups, as shown in ROC curve analysis. Further validation of these miRNAs in larger patient cohorts and across different stages of PCa may strengthen their candidacy as clinically relevant biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis."
38790189,Exploring the Role of E6 and E7 Oncoproteins in Cervical Oncogenesis through MBD2/3-NuRD Complex Chromatin Remodeling.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is among the highest-ranking types of cancer worldwide, with human papillomavirus (HPV) as the agent driving the malignant process. One aspect of the infection's evolution is given by epigenetic modifications, mainly DNA methylation and chromatin alteration. These processes are guided by several chromatin remodeling complexes, including NuRD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genome-wide binding patterns of the NuRD complex components (MBD2 and MBD3) in the presence of active HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes and to determine the potential of identified genes through an experimental model to differentiate between cervical precursor lesions, with the aim of establishing their utility as biomarkers. METHODS: The experimental model was built using the CaSki cell line and shRNA for E6 and E7 HPV16 silencing, ChIP-seq, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. Selected genes' expression was also assessed in patients. RESULTS: Several genes have been identified to exhibit altered transcriptional activity due to the influence of HPV16 E6/E7 viral oncogenes acting through the MBD2/MBD3 NuRD complex, linking them to viral infection and cervical oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The impacted genes primarily play roles in governing gene transcription, mRNA processing, and regulation of translation. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights into the process of HPV-induced oncogenesis."
38788815,Gene expression signature of castrate resistant prostate cancer.,"Prostate gland is a highly androgen dependent gland and hence the first line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer happens to be androgen ablation. This is achieved by multiple non-surgical methods. However, most of these cancers although respond well initially, become resistant to androgen ablation sooner or later. These cancers then become extremely aggressive and difficult to treat, thereby drastically affect the patient prognosis. Identification of a gene expression signature for castrate resistant prostate cancer may aid in identification of mechanisms responsible for castrate resistance, which in turn would help in better management of the disease. METHODS: Patient samples belonging to a. Control group; b. Castrate Sensitive group and c. Castrate Resistant group were collected. Gene expression profiling was performed on these samples using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes between control and castrate sensitive as well as control and castrate resistant groups were identified. This data was compared with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in order to get relevance in prognosis. RESULTS: We have identified 481 differentially expressed genes between control and castrate sensitive groups; and 446 genes differentially expressed between control and castrate resistant groups. We have also identified 364 genes which are expressed in the castrate resistant group alone, which is of interest since these may have an implication in evolution of castrate resistance and also prognosis. When compared to prostate cancer data from TCGA, 763 genes were found in common to our dataset. With this, a CaS and CaR signature was defined. Using criteria such as overall survival, disease-free survival, progression-free survival and biochemical recurrence, we have identified genes that may have relevance in progression to castrate resistance and in prognosis. Functional annotation of these genes may give an insight into the mechanism of development of castrate resistance."
38785827,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) Suppresses Prognostic Survival Biomarkers Associated with Cell Cycle and Actin Organization in a Non-Malignant African American Prostate Cell Line.","Vitamin D(3) is a steroid hormone that confers anti-tumorigenic properties in prostate cells. Serum vitamin D(3) deficiency has been associated with advanced prostate cancer (PCa), particularly affecting African American (AA) men. Therefore, elucidating the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D on signaling pathways, essential to maintaining non-malignancy, may provide additional drug targets to mitigate disparate outcomes for men with PCa, especially AA men. We conducted RNA sequencing on an AA non-malignant prostate cell line, RC-77N/E, comparing untreated cells to those treated with 10 nM of vitamin D(3) metabolite, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), at 24 h. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 1601 significant genes affected by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Pathway enrichment analysis predicted 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3-) mediated repression of prostate cancer, cell proliferation, actin cytoskeletal, and actin-related signaling pathways (p < 0.05). Prioritizing genes with vitamin D response elements and associating expression levels with overall survival (OS) in The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA PRAD) cohort, we identified ANLN (Anillin) and ECT2 (Epithelial Cell Transforming 2) as potential prognostic PCa biomarkers. Both genes were strongly correlated and significantly downregulated by 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment, where low expression was statistically associated with better overall survival outcomes in the TCGA PRAD public cohort. Increased ANLN and ECT2 mRNA gene expression was significantly associated with PCa, and Gleason scores using both the TCGA cohort (p < 0.05) and an AA non-malignant/tumor-matched cohort. Our findings suggest 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulation of these biomarkers may be significant for PCa prevention. In addition, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) could be used as an adjuvant treatment targeting actin cytoskeleton signaling and actin cytoskeleton-related signaling pathways, particularly among AA men."
38785459,Mixed Adenosquamous Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate with Paired Sequencing on the Primary and Liver Metastasis.,"This report aims to shed light on the intricate challenges encountered during the diagnosis and treatment of an uncommon variant of prostate cancer-mixed adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the prostate. Prostate cancers of this nature pose distinctive diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas due to their rarity and complex histological composition. We present a case of a 63-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer, featuring adenocarcinoma with squamous cell differentiation, who underwent a multimodal treatment approach. The patient responded to first-line carboplatin, docetaxel, and androgen deprivation therapy, followed by androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) maintenance. However, disease progression led to radiation therapy and a subsequent switch to Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan after chemotherapy challenges. Comprehensive genetic profiling revealed shared mutations in the prostate and liver lesions, emphasizing the role of targeted therapies. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted therapy resulted in a notable PSA decline. This case highlights the evolving treatment landscape for rare prostate cancers, integrating genetic insights for tailored interventions. In conclusion, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the prostate is rare, emphasizing the imperative for enhanced comprehension in diagnosis and management. Our case suggests the potential efficacy of ARPI and PSMA-targeted therapies. Our findings advocate for a more nuanced approach to the management of this rare prostate cancer variant, leveraging genomic insights for personalized treatment strategies. This exploration serves as a foundation for further research and clinical considerations in addressing the challenges posed by mixed adenosquamous cell carcinoma of the prostate."
38785139,"Analysis of BRCA1 germline variants (exons 5, 11 and 20) in breast cancer families from Libya.","Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths in Libyan women. BRCA1 variants differ globally due to the diversity of genetic makeup and populations history. Their distribution, prevalence, and significance in Libyans remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the characteristics and distribution of BRCA1 variants in exons 5, 11, and 20 in Libyan families with BC. Thirty-six BC patients at </= 45 years, between 46-50 years and with a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer in close relatives, or with triple-negative BC, were selected from 33 unrelated families during 2018-2020 at the National Cancer Institute, Sabratha, Libya. From these 33 families, 20 women (18 BC patients and two unaffected) were screened for BRCA1 exons 5, 11 and 20 using Sanger sequencing. All families completed an epidemiology and family history questionnaire. Twenty-seven variants (26 in exon 11 and 1 in exon 20, minor allele frequency of < 0.01) were detected in 10 of 18 unrelated families (55.6%.) Among the 27 variants, 26 (96%) were heterozygous. A frameshift pathogenic variant, c.2643del, and one novel variant c.1366A>G were identified. Furthermore, seven variants with unknown clinical significance were detected: c.1158T>A, c.1346C>G, c.1174C>G, c.3630 G>T, c.3599A>T, and c.3400 G>C in exon 11, and c.5244T>A in exon 20. Six variants with conflicting pathogenicity interpretations, c. 3460T>A, c. 3572 G>A, c. 3700 G>C, c. 1246C>G, c. 1344C>G, and c. 1054 G>A, were also identified. Twelve benign/likely benign variants were identified. Rare BRCA1 variants that have not been reported in North Africa were found in Libyan patients. These findings provide preliminary insights into the BRCA1 variants that could contribute to hereditary BC risk in Libyans. Further functional, computational, and population analyses are essential to determine their significance and potential impact on BC risk, which could ultimately lead to more personalized management strategies."
38783246,Prognostic value of 17-Gene genomic prostate score in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) test has been clinically employed to predict adverse prognosis in prostate cancer. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the 17-gene GPS in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: Potentially relevant studies were obtained by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase databases from their inception to December 1, 2023. Studies were considered eligible if they evaluated the association of the 17-gene GPS with distant metastases, biochemical recurrence, or prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in prostate cancer patients. To estimate the prognostic value, we pooled the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the high versus low GPS group or per 20-unit increase in GPS. RESULTS: Seven cohort studies that reported on 8 articles comprising 1,962 patients satisfied the eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis showed that per 20-unit increase in GPS was significantly associated with distant metastases (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.97-4.53), biochemical recurrence (HR 2.18; 95% CI 1.64-2.89), and PCSM (HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.86-5.30). Moreover, patients with high GPS (> 40 points) had an increased risk of distant metastases (HR 5.22; 95% CI 3.72-7.31), biochemical recurrence (HR 4.41; 95% CI 2.29-8.49), and PCSM (HR 3.81; 95% CI 1.74-8.33) than those with low GPS (</= 40 points). CONCLUSIONS: A higher 17-gene GPS significantly predicts distant metastases, biochemical recurrence, and PCSM in men with clinically localized prostate cancer. However, large-scale multicenter prospective studies are necessary to further validate these findings."
38783119,Drugst.One - a plug-and-play solution for online systems medicine and network-based drug repurposing.,"In recent decades, the development of new drugs has become increasingly expensive and inefficient, and the molecular mechanisms of most pharmaceuticals remain poorly understood.

38783043,The association between three prevalent autoimmune disorders and the likelihood of developing prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Numerous studies establish a significant correlation between autoimmune disorders (AIDs) and prostate cancer (PCa). Our Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis investigates the potential connection between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and PCa, aiming to confirm causal links between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hyperthyroidism, and PCa. Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies provided data on PCa and three AIDs. MR analysis, using IVW as the main approach, assessed causal relationships, validated by sensitivity analysis. IVW revealed a correlation between genetically anticipated RA and PCa, notably in Europeans (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.04, p = 2*10-5). Evidence supported a lower PCa risk in individuals with SLE (OR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97, p = 2*10-4) and hyperthyroidism (OR = 0.02; 95% CI 0.001-0.2, p = 2*10-3). Weighted mode and median confirmed these findings. No pleiotropic effects were observed, and MR heterogeneity tests indicated dataset homogeneity. Our study establishes a causal link between RA, SLE, hyperthyroidism, and PCa."
38783016,Synthesis and new DNA targeting activity of 6- and 7-tert-butylfascaplysins.,"Fascaplysin is a red cytotoxic pigment with anticancer properties isolated from the marine sponge Fascaplysinopsis sp. Recently, structure-activity relationship analysis reported by our group suggested that selective cytotoxicity of fascaplysin derivatives towards tumor cells negatively correlates with their ability to intercalate into DNA. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized 6- and 7-tert-butylfascaplysins which reveal mitigated DNA-intercalating properties. These derivatives were found to be strongly cytotoxic to drug-resistant human prostate cancer cells, albeit did not demonstrate improved selectivity towards cancer cells when compared to fascaplysin. At the same time, kinome analysis suggested an activation of CHK1/ATR axis in cancer cells shortly after the drug exposure. Further experiments revealed induction of replication stress that is eventually converted to the toxic DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death. Our observations highlight new DNA-targeting effect of some fascaplysin derivatives and indicate more complex structure-activity relationships within the fascaplysin family, suggesting that cytotoxicity and selectivity of these alkaloids are influenced by multiple factors. Furthermore, combination with clinically-approved inhibitors of ATR/CHK1 as well as testing in tumors particularly sensitive to the DNA damage should be considered in further studies."
38781543,Differential Tumor Gene Expression Profiling of Patients With Prostate Adenocarcinoma on the Basis of BMI.,"PURPOSE: An increased BMI is linked to increased prostate adenocarcinoma incidence and mortality. Baseline tumor gene expression profiling (GEP) can provide a comprehensive picture of the biological processes related to treatment response and disease progression. We interrogate and validate the underlying differences in tumor GEP on the basis of BMI in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The inclusion criteria consisted of histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma and the availability of RNA sequencing data obtained from treatment-naive primary prostate tissue. RNA sequencing was performed by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory (Tempus or Caris Life Sciences). The Tempus cohort was used for interrogation and the Caris cohort for validation. Patients were stratified on the basis of BMI at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis: BMI-high (BMI(H); BMI >/=30) and BMI-low (BMI(L); BMI <30). Differential gene expression analysis between the two cohorts was conducted using the DEseq2 pipeline. The resulting GEPs were further analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment software to identify pathways that exhibited enrichment in each cohort. RESULTS: Overall, 102 patients were eligible, with 60 patients in the Tempus cohort (BMI(L) = 38, BMI(H) = 22) and 42 patients in the Caris cohort (BMI(L) = 24, BMI(H) = 18). Tumor tissues obtained from patients in the BMI(L) group exhibited higher expression of genes associated with inflammation pathways. BMI(H) displayed increased expression of genes involved in pathways such as heme metabolism and androgen response. CONCLUSION: Our study shows the upregulation of distinct genomic pathways in BMI(L) compared with BMI(H) patients with prostate cancer. These hypothesis-generating data could explain different survival outcomes in both groups and guide personalized therapy for men with prostate cancer."
38781342,CK2-dependent degradation of CBX3 dictates replication fork stalling and PARP inhibitor sensitivity.,"DNA replication is a vulnerable cellular process, and its deregulation leads to genomic instability. Here, we demonstrate that chromobox protein homolog 3 (CBX3) binds replication protein A 32-kDa subunit (RPA2) and regulates RPA2 retention at stalled replication forks. CBX3 is recruited to stalled replication forks by RPA2 and inhibits ring finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3)-facilitated replication restart. Phosphorylation of CBX3 at serine-95 by casein kinase 2 (CK2) kinase augments cadherin 1 (CDH1)-mediated CBX3 degradation and RPA2 dynamics at stalled replication forks, which permits replication fork restart. Increased expression of CBX3 due to gene amplification or CK2 inhibitor treatment sensitizes prostate cancer cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors while inducing replication stress and DNA damage. Our work reveals CBX3 as a key regulator of RPA2 function and DNA replication, suggesting that CBX3 could serve as an indicator for targeted therapy of cancer using PARP inhibitors."
38780613,FOXS1 acts as an oncogene and induces EMT through FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway by upregulating HILPDA in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a widespread global health concern characterized by elevated rates of occurrence, and there is a need for novel therapeutic targets to enhance patient outcomes. FOXS1 is closely linked to different cancers, but its function in PCa is still unknown. The expression of FOXS1, its prognostic role, clinical significance in PCa, and the potential mechanism by which FOXS1 affects PCa progression were investigated through bioinformatics analysis utilizing public data. The levels of FOXS1 and HILPDA were evaluated in clinical PCa samples using various methods, such as western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. To examine the function and molecular mechanisms of FOXS1 in PCa, a combination of experimental techniques including CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, Transwell assay, and Co-IP assay were employed. The FOXS1 expression levels were significantly raised in PCa, correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness and an unfavorable prognosis. Regulating FOXS1 expression, whether upregulating or downregulating it, correspondingly enhanced or inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion capabilities of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we detected a direct interaction between FOXS1 and HILPDA, resulting in the pathway activation of FAK/PI3K/AKT and facilitation EMT in PCa cells. FOXS1 collaborates with HILPDA to initiate EMT, thereby facilitating the PCa progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway activation."
38780289,A novel clinical metaproteomics workflow enables bioinformatic analysis of host-microbe dynamics in disease.,"Clinical metaproteomics has the potential to offer insights into the host-microbiome interactions underlying diseases. However, the field faces challenges in characterizing microbial proteins found in clinical samples, usually present at low abundance relative to the host proteins. As a solution, we have developed an integrated workflow coupling mass spectrometry-based analysis with customized bioinformatic identification, quantification, and prioritization of microbial proteins, enabling targeted assay development to investigate host-microbe dynamics in disease. The bioinformatics tools are implemented in the Galaxy ecosystem, offering the development and dissemination of complex bioinformatic workflows. The modular workflow integrates MetaNovo (to generate a reduced protein database), SearchGUI/PeptideShaker and MaxQuant [to generate peptide-spectral matches (PSMs) and quantification], PepQuery2 (to verify the quality of PSMs), Unipept (for taxonomic and functional annotation), and MSstatsTMT (for statistical analysis). We have utilized this workflow in diverse clinical samples, from the characterization of nasopharyngeal swab samples to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness via analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs. The complete workflow, including training data and documentation, is available via the Galaxy Training Network, empowering non-expert researchers to utilize these powerful tools in their clinical studies. IMPORTANCE: Clinical metaproteomics has immense potential to offer functional insights into the microbiome and its contributions to human disease. However, there are numerous challenges in the metaproteomic analysis of clinical samples, including handling of very large protein sequence databases for sensitive and accurate peptide and protein identification from mass spectrometry data, as well as taxonomic and functional annotation of quantified peptides and proteins to enable interpretation of results. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel clinical metaproteomics workflow that provides customized bioinformatic identification, verification, quantification, and taxonomic and functional annotation. This bioinformatic workflow is implemented in the Galaxy ecosystem and has been used to characterize diverse clinical sample types, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness and availability for use by the research community via analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs."
38779031,Epigenetic-related gene-based prognostic model construction and validation in prostate adenocarcinoma.,"Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), driven by both genetic and epigenetic factors, is a common malignancy that affects men worldwide. We aimed to identify and characterize differentially expressed epigenetic-related genes (ERGs) in PRAD and investigate their potential roles in disease progression and prognosis. We used PRAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify prognosis-associated ERGs. Thirteen ERGs with two distinct expression profiles were identified through consensus clustering. Gene set variation analysis highlighted differences in pathway activities, particularly in the Hedgehog and Notch pathways. Higher epigenetic scores correlated with favorable prognosis and improved immunotherapeutic response. Experimental validation underscored the importance of CBX3 and KAT2A, suggesting their pivotal roles in PRAD. This study provides crucial insights into the epigenetic scoring approach and presents a promising prognostic tool, with CBX3 and KAT2A as key players. These findings pave the way for targeted and personalized interventions for the treatment of PRAD."
38776708,Knockdown of YTHDF2 initiates ERS-induced apoptosis and cancer stemness suppression by sustaining GLI2 stability in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer ranks fourth in women in terms of incidence and mortality. The RNA-binding protein YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) contributes to cancer progression by incompletely understood mechanisms. We show how YTHDF2 controls the fate of cervical cancer cells and whether YTHDF2 could be a valid target for the therapy of cervical cancer. Sphere formation and alkaline phosphatase staining assays were performed to evaluate tumor stemness of cervical cancer cells following YTHDF2 knockdown. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The compounds 4PBA and SP600125 were used to investigate the correlation between JNK, endoplasmic reticulum stress, tumor stemness, and apoptosis. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed that GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) might be the target of YTHDF2. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were employed to investigate the association between the GLI2 mRNA and YTHDF2. Nude mouse xenografts were generated to assess the effects of YTHDF2 knockdown on cervical cancer growth in vivo. Knockdown of YTHDF2 up-regulated the expression of GLI2, leading to JNK phosphorylation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These processes inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells and their tumor cell stemness and promotion of apoptosis. In conclusion, the knockdown of YTHDF2 significantly affects the progression of cervical cancer cells, making it a potential target for treating cervical cancer."
38775334,An effective urobilin clearance strategy based on paramagnetic beads facilitates microscale proteomic analysis of urine.,"Urine provides an ideal source for disease biomarker discovery. High-adhesion contaminants such as urobilin, which are difficult to remove from urine, can severely interfere with urinary proteomic analysis. Here, we aimed to establish a strategy based on single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) technology to prepare samples for urinary proteomics analysis that almost completely eliminates the impact of urobilin. A systematic evaluation of the effects of two urinary protein precipitation methods, two types of protein lysis buffers, and different ratios of magnetic digestion beads on the identification and quantification of the microscale urinary proteome was conducted. Our results indicate that methanol-chloroform precipitation, coupled with efficient lysis facilitated by urea, and subsequent enzymatic digestion using a mix of hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetic beads offers the best performance. Further applying this strategy to the urine of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer and healthy individuals, combined with a narrow window of data-independent acquisition, FGFR4, MYLK, ORM2, GOLM1, SPP1, CD55, CSF1, DLD and TIMP3 were identified as potential biomarkers to discriminate benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients."
38774467,Expert Perspectives on Controversies in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Management: Narrative Review and Report of the First US Prostate Cancer Conference Part 2.,"BACKGROUND: Management strategies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have rapidly shifted in recent years. As novel imaging and therapeutic approaches have made their way to the clinic, providers are encountering increasingly challenging clinical scenarios, with limited guidance from the current literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Prostate Cancer Conference (USPCC) is a multidisciplinary meeting of prostate cancer experts intended to address the many challenges of prostate cancer management. At the first annual USPCC meeting, areas of controversy and consensus were identified during a 2-day meeting that included expert presentations, full-panel discussions, and postdiscussion responses to questions developed by the USPCC cochairs and session moderators. RESULTS: This narrative review covers the USPCC expert discussion and perspectives relevant to mCRPC, including neuroendocrine/aggressive-variant prostate cancer (NEPC/AVPC). Areas of broad agreement identified among USPCC experts include the benefits of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, the use of radioligand therapy in patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC, and the need for clinical trials that address real-world clinical questions, including the performance of novel therapies when compared with modern standard-of-care treatment. Ongoing areas of controversy and uncertainty included the appropriateness of PARP inhibitors in patients with non-BRCA1/2 mutations, the optimal definition of PSMA positivity, and systemic therapies for patients with NEPC/AVPC after progression on platinum-based therapies. CONCLUSIONS: The first annual USPCC meeting identified several areas of controversy in the management of mCRPC, highlighting the urgent need for clinical trials designed to facilitate treatment selection and sequencing in this heterogeneous disease state."
38774466,Expert Perspectives on Controversies in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Management: Narrative Review and Report of the First US Prostate Cancer Conference Part 1.,"PURPOSE: Castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) is a complex and heterogeneous condition encompassing a range of clinical presentations. As new approaches have expanded management options, clinicians are left with myriad questions and controversies regarding the optimal individualized management of CSPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Prostate Cancer Conference (USPCC) multidisciplinary panel was assembled to address the challenges of prostate cancer management. The first annual USPCC meeting included experts in urology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nuclear medicine. USPCC co-chairs and session moderators identified key areas of controversy and uncertainty in prostate cancer management and organized the sessions with multidisciplinary presentations and discussion. Throughout the meeting, experts responded to questions prepared by chairs and moderators to identify areas of agreement and controversy. RESULTS: The USPCC panel discussion and question responses for CSPC-related topics are presented. Key advances in CSPC management endorsed by USPCC experts included the development and clinical utilization of gene expression classifiers and artificial intelligence (AI) models for risk stratification and treatment selection in specific patient populations, the use of advanced imaging modalities in patients with clinically localized unfavorable intermediate or high-risk disease and those with biochemical recurrence, recommendations of doublet or triplet therapy for metastatic CSPC (mCSPC), and consideration of prostate and/or metastasis-directed radiation therapy in select patients with mCSPC. CONCLUSIONS: CSPC is a diverse disease with many therapeutic options and the potential for adverse outcomes associated with either undertreatment or overtreatment. Future studies are needed to validate and clinically integrate novel technologies, including genomics, AI, and advanced imaging, to optimize outcomes among patients with CSPC."
38774081,Integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing data to explore the role of mitophagy-related genes in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy of the male urinary system. Mitophagy, as a type of autophagy, can remove damaged mitochondria in cells. Mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) have been shown to play critical roles in the development of PCa. To this end, based on the comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data of PCa samples and their controls, this paper identified PCa subtypes and constructed a prognostic model. In this paper, we downloaded scRNA-seq and RNA-seq data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and TCGA database. Based on the R package ""Seurat"" to process the scRNA-seq data, a total of five cell types were identified. Each cell population was scored based on the R package ""AUCell"" and using the intersection genes between MRGs and each cell population. The B cell population was then identified as a high-scoring cell population. Differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq data were identified based on the R package ""limma"" and intersected with previously intersected genes. Then, based on univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso-Cox regression analysis, the prognostic genes were screened, and the risk model was constructed (composed of ADH5, CAT, BCAT2, DCXR, OGT, and FUS). The model is validated on internal and external test sets. Independent prognostic analysis identified age, N stage, and risk score as independent prognostic factors. This paper's risk models and prognostic genes can provide a reference for developing novel therapeutic targets for PCa."
38773520,HATCHet2: clone- and haplotype-specific copy number inference from bulk tumor sequencing data.,"Bulk DNA sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor is becoming common, yet most methods to infer copy-number aberrations (CNAs) from this data analyze individual samples independently. We introduce HATCHet2, an algorithm to identify haplotype- and clone-specific CNAs simultaneously from multiple bulk samples. HATCHet2 extends the earlier HATCHet method by improving identification of focal CNAs and introducing a novel statistic, the minor haplotype B-allele frequency (mhBAF), that enables identification of mirrored-subclonal CNAs. We demonstrate HATCHet2's improved accuracy using simulations and a single-cell sequencing dataset. HATCHet2 analysis of 10 prostate cancer patients reveals previously unreported mirrored-subclonal CNAs affecting cancer genes."
38773257,Stacked neural network for predicting polygenic risk score.,"In recent years, the utility of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in forecasting disease susceptibility from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results has been widely recognised. Yet, these models face limitations due to overfitting and the potential overestimation of effect sizes in correlated variants. To surmount these obstacles, we devised the Stacked Neural Network Polygenic Risk Score (SNPRS). This novel approach synthesises outputs from multiple neural network models, each calibrated using genetic variants chosen based on diverse p-value thresholds. By doing so, SNPRS captures a broader array of genetic variants, enabling a more nuanced interpretation of the combined effects of these variants. We assessed the efficacy of SNPRS using the UK Biobank data, focusing on the genetic risks associated with breast and prostate cancers, as well as quantitative traits like height and BMI. We also extended our analysis to the Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) dataset. Impressively, our results indicate that SNPRS surpasses traditional PRS models and an isolated deep neural network in terms of accuracy, highlighting its promise in refining the efficacy and relevance of PRS in genetic studies."
38773237,"Previously reported CCDC26 risk variant and novel germline variants in GALNT13, AR, and MYO10 associated with familial glioma in Finland.","Predisposing factors underlying familial aggregation of non-syndromic gliomas are still to be uncovered. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in four Finnish families with brain tumors to identify rare predisposing variants. A total of 417 detected exome variants and 102 previously reported glioma-related variants were further genotyped in 19 Finnish families with brain tumors using targeted sequencing. Rare damaging variants in GALNT13, MYO10 and AR were identified. Two families carried either c.553C>T (R185C) or c.1214T>A (L405Q) on GALNT13. Variant c.553C>T is located on the substrate-binding site of GALNT13. AR c.2180G>T (R727L), which is located on a ligand-binding domain of AR, was detected in two families, one of which also carried a GALNT13 variant. MYO10 c.4448A>G (N1483S) was detected in two families and c.1511C>T (A504V) variant was detected in one family. Both variants are located on functional domains related to MYO10 activity in filopodia formation. In addition, affected cases in six families carried a known glioma risk variant rs55705857 in CCDC26 and low-risk glioma variants. These novel findings indicate polygenic inheritance of familial glioma in Finland and increase our understanding of the genetic contribution to familial glioma susceptibility."
38773164,Promoter hypermethylation as a novel regulator of ANO1 expression and function in prostate cancer bone metastasis.,"Despite growing evidence implicating the calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin1 (ANO1) in cancer metastasis, its direct impact on the metastatic potential of prostate cancer and the possible significance of epigenetic alteration in this process are not fully understood. Here, we show that ANO1 is minimally expressed in LNCap and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines with low metastatic potential but overexpressed in high metastatic PC3 prostate cancer cell line. The treatment of LNCap and DU145 cells with DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) potentiates ANO1 expression, suggesting that DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms controlling ANO1 expression. Consistent with this notion, hypermethylation was detected at the CpG island of ANO1 promoter region in LNCap and DU145 cells, and 5-Aza-CdR treatment resulted in a drastic demethylation at promoter CpG methylation sites. Upon 5-Aza-CdR treatment, metastatic indexes, such as cell motility, invasion, and metastasis-related gene expression, were significantly altered in LNCap and DU145 cells. These 5-Aza-CdR-induced metastatic hallmarks were, however, almost completely ablated by stable knockdown of ANO1. These in vitro discoveries were further supported by our in vivo observation that ANO1 expression in xenograft mouse models enhances the metastatic dissemination of prostate cancer cells into tibial bone and the development of osteolytic lesions. Collectively, our results help elucidate the critical role of ANO1 expression in prostate cancer bone metastases, which is epigenetically modulated by promoter CpG methylation."
38773085,Integrative multi-region molecular profiling of primary prostate cancer in men with synchronous lymph node metastasis.,"Localized prostate cancer is frequently composed of multiple spatially distinct tumors with significant inter- and intra-tumoral molecular heterogeneity. This genomic diversity gives rise to many competing clones that may drive the biological trajectory of the disease. Previous large-scale sequencing efforts have focused on the evolutionary process in metastatic prostate cancer, revealing a potential clonal progression to castration resistance. However, the clonal origin of synchronous lymph node (LN) metastases in primary disease is still unknown. Here, we perform multi-region, targeted next generation sequencing and construct phylogenetic trees in men with prostate cancer with synchronous LN metastasis to better define the pathologic and molecular features of primary disease most likely to spread to the LNs. Collectively, we demonstrate that a combination of histopathologic and molecular factors, including tumor grade, presence of extra-prostatic extension, cellular morphology, and oncogenic genomic alterations are associated with synchronous LN metastasis."
38772281,Sialic acid blockade inhibits the metastatic spread of prostate cancer to bone.,"BACKGROUND: Bone metastasis is a common consequence of advanced prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates can be used to manage symptoms, but there are currently no curative treatments available. Altered tumour cell glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and is an important driver of a malignant phenotype. In prostate cancer, the sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 is upregulated, and studies show ST6GAL1-mediated aberrant sialylation of N-glycans promotes prostate tumour growth and disease progression. METHODS: Here, we monitor ST6GAL1 in tumour and serum samples from men with aggressive prostate cancer and using in vitro and in vivo models we investigate the role of ST6GAL1 in prostate cancer bone metastasis. FINDINGS: ST6GAL1 is upregulated in patients with prostate cancer with tumours that have spread to the bone and can promote prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo. The mechanisms involved are multi-faceted and involve modification of the pre-metastatic niche towards bone resorption to promote the vicious cycle, promoting the development of M2 like macrophages, and the regulation of immunosuppressive sialoglycans. Furthermore, using syngeneic mouse models, we show that inhibiting sialylation can block the spread of prostate tumours to bone. INTERPRETATION: Our study identifies an important role for ST6GAL1 and alpha2-6 sialylated N-glycans in prostate cancer bone metastasis, provides proof-of-concept data to show that inhibiting sialylation can suppress the spread of prostate tumours to bone, and highlights sialic acid blockade as an exciting new strategy to develop new therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

38769249,The acceptability and clinical impact of using polygenic scores for risk-estimation of common cancers in primary care: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Polygenic scores (PGS) have been developed for cancer risk-estimation and show potential as tools to prompt earlier referral for high-risk individuals and aid risk-stratification within cancer screening programmes. This review explores the potential for using PGS to identify individuals at risk of the most common cancers seen in primary care. METHODS: Two electronic databases were searched up until November 2023 to identify quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies that reported on the acceptability and clinical impact of using PGS to identify individuals at highest risk of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer in primary care. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of included studies and a narrative synthesis was used to analyse data. RESULTS: A total of 190 papers were identified, 18 of which were eligible for inclusion. A cancer risk-assessment tool incorporating PGS was acceptable to the general practice population and their healthcare providers but major challenges to implementation were identified, including lack of evidence for PGS in non-European ancestry and a need for healthcare provider education in genomic medicine. A PGS cancer risk-assessment had relatively limited impact on psychosocial outcomes and health behaviours. However, for prostate cancer, potential applications for its use in primary care were shown. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer risk assessment incorporating PGS in primary care is acceptable to patients and healthcare providers but there is a paucity of research exploring clinical impact. Few studies were identified, and more research is required before clinical implementation of PGS can be recommended."
38768661,Prostate cancer-derived extracellular vesicles metabolic biomarkers: Emerging roles for diagnosis and prognosis.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a global health concern, ranking as the most common cancer among men in Western countries. Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive with adverse effects on patients. Due to the heterogeneous nature of PCa and their multifocality, tissue biopsies often yield false-negative results. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring innovative approaches, particularly in the realms of proteomics and metabolomics, to identify more reliable biomarkers and improve PCa diagnosis. Liquid biopsy (LB) has emerged as a promising non-invasive strategy for PCa early detection, biopsy selection, active surveillance for low-risk cases, and post-treatment and progression monitoring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bilayer nanovesicles released by all cell types and play an important role in intercellular communication. EVs have garnered attention as a valuable biomarker resource in LB for PCa-specific biomarkers, enhancing diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance. Metabolomics provides insight into the body's metabolic response to both internal and external stimuli, offering quantitative measurements of biochemical alterations. It excels at detecting non-genetic influences, aiding in the discovery of more accurate cancer biomarkers for early detection and disease progression monitoring. This review delves into the potential of EVs as a resource for LB in PCa across various clinical applications. It also explores cancer-related metabolic biomarkers, both within and outside EVs in PCa, and summarises previous metabolomic findings in PCa diagnosis and risk assessment. Finally, the article addresses the challenges and future directions in the evolving field of EV-based metabolomic analysis, offering a comprehensive overview of its potential in advancing PCa management."
38766261,"Characterising the contribution of rare protein-coding germline variants to prostate cancer risk and severity in 37,184 cases.","The etiology of prostate cancer, the second most common cancer in men globally, has a strong heritable component. While rare coding germline variants in several genes have been identified as risk factors from candidate gene and linkage studies, the exome-wide spectrum of causal rare variants remains to be fully explored. To more comprehensively address their contribution, we analysed data from 37,184 prostate cancer cases and 331,329 male controls from five cohorts with germline exome/genome sequencing and one cohort with imputed array data from a population enriched in low-frequency deleterious variants. Our gene-level collapsing analysis revealed that rare damaging variants in SAMHD1 as well as genes in the DNA damage response pathway (BRCA2, ATM and CHEK2) are associated with the risk of overall prostate cancer. We also found that rare damaging variants in AOX1 and BRCA2 were associated with increased severity of prostate cancer in a case-only analysis of aggressive versus non-aggressive prostate cancer. At the single-variant level, we found rare non-synonymous variants in three genes (HOXB13, CHEK2, BIK) significantly associated with increased risk of overall prostate cancer and in four genes (ANO7, SPDL1, AR, TERT) with decreased risk. Altogether, this study provides deeper insights into the genetic architecture and biological basis of prostate cancer risk and severity."
38766207,"DNA Methylation-Derived Immune Cell Proportions and Cancer Risk, Including Lung Cancer, in Black Participants.","Prior cohort studies assessing cancer risk based on immune cell subtype profiles have predominantly focused on White populations. This limitation obscures vital insights into how cancer risk varies across race. Immune cell subtype proportions were estimated using deconvolution based on leukocyte DNA methylation markers from blood samples collected at baseline on participants without cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Over a mean of 17.5 years of follow-up, 668 incident cancers were diagnosed in 2,467 Black participants. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine immune cell subtype proportions and overall cancer incidence and site-specific incidence (lung, breast, and prostate cancers). Higher T regulatory cell proportions were associated with statistically significantly higher lung cancer risk (hazard ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.41 per percent increase). Increased memory B cell proportions were associated with significantly higher risk of prostate cancer (1.17, 1.04-1.33) and all cancers (1.13, 1.05-1.22). Increased CD8+ naive cell proportions were associated with significantly lower risk of all cancers in participants >/=55 years (0.91, 0.83-0.98). Other immune cell subtypes did not display statistically significant associations with cancer risk. These results in Black participants align closely with prior findings in largely White populations. Findings from this study could help identify those at high cancer risk and outline risk stratifying to target patients for cancer screening, prevention, and other interventions. Further studies should assess these relationships in other cancer types, better elucidate the interplay of B cells in cancer risk, and identify biomarkers for personalized risk stratification."
38766099,"AR coactivators, CBP/p300, are critical mediators of DNA repair in prostate cancer.","Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains an incurable disease stage with ineffective treatments options. Here, the androgen receptor (AR) coactivators CBP/p300, which are histone acetyltransferases, were identified as critical mediators of DNA damage repair (DDR) to potentially enhance therapeutic targeting of CRPC. Key findings demonstrate that CBP/p300 expression increases with disease progression and selects for poor prognosis in metastatic disease. CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibition enhances response to standard of care therapeutics. Functional studies, CBP/p300 cistrome mapping, and transcriptome in CRPC revealed that CBP/p300 regulates DDR. Further mechanistic investigation showed that CBP/p300 attenuation via therapeutic targeting and genomic knockdown decreases homologous recombination (HR) factors in vitro, in vivo, and in human prostate cancer (PCa) tumors ex vivo. Similarly, CBP/p300 expression in human prostate tissue correlates with HR factors. Lastly, targeting CBP/p300 impacts HR-mediate repair and patient outcome. Collectively, these studies identify CBP/p300 as drivers of PCa tumorigenesis and lay the groundwork to optimize therapeutic strategies for advanced PCa via CBP/p300 inhibition, potentially in combination with AR-directed and DDR therapies."
38763054,The 5-WS of targeting DNA-damage repair (DDR) pathways in prostate cancer.,"DNA-damage repair (DDR) pathways alterations, a growing area of interest in oncology, are detected in about 20% of patient with prostate cancer and are associated with improved sensitivity to poly(ADP ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibitors. In May 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two PARP inhibitors (olaparib and rucaparib) for prostate cancer treatment. Moreover, germline aberrations in DDR pathways genes have also been related to familial or hereditary prostate cancer, requiring tailored health-care programs. These emerging scenarios are rapidly changing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer management. The aim of this review is to highlight the five W-points of DDR pathways in prostate cancer: why targeting DDR pathways in prostate cancer; what we should test for genomic profiling in prostate cancer; ""where"" testing genetic assessment in prostate cancer (germline or somatic, solid or liquid biopsy); when genetic testing is appropriate in prostate cancer; who could get benefit from PARP inhibitors; how improve patients outcome with combinations strategies."
38762700,Potential drug targets for tumors identified through Mendelian randomization analysis.,"According to the latest cancer research data, there are a significant number of new cancer cases and a substantial mortality rate each year. Although a substantial number of clinical patients are treated with existing cancer drugs each year, the efficacy is unsatisfactory. The incidence is still high and the effectiveness of most cancer drugs remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, we evaluated the human proteins for their causal relationship to for cancer risk and therefore also their potential as drug targets. We used summary tumors data from the FinnGen and cis protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) data from a genome-wide association study, and employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the association between potential drug targets and nine tumors, including breast, colorectal, lung, liver, bladder, prostate, kidney, head and neck, pancreatic caners. Furthermore, we conducted MR analysis on external cohort. Moreover, Bidirectional MR, Steiger filtering, and colocalization were employed to validate the main results. The DrugBank database was used to discover potential drugs of tumors. Under the threshold of False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, results showed that S100A16 was protective protein and S100A14 was risk protein for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER-positive) breast cancer, phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) was risk protein for colorectal cancer, and melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) was protective protein for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). And there was no reverse causal association between them. Colocalization analysis showed that S100A14 (PP.H4.abf = 0.920) and S100A16 (PP.H4.abf = 0.932) shared causal variation with HER-positive breast cancer, and PDE5A (PP.H4.abf = 0.857) shared causal variation with colorectal cancer (CRC). The MR results of all pQTL of PDE5A and MIA were consistent with main results. In addition, the MR results of MIA and external outcome cohort were consistent with main results. In this study, genetic predictions indicate that circulating S100 calcium binding protein A14 (S100A14) and S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) are associated with increase and decrease in the risk of HER-positive breast cancer, respectively. Circulating PDE5A is associated with increased risk of CRC, while circulating MIA is associated with decreased risk of NSCLC. These findings suggest that four proteins may serve as biomarkers for cancer prevention and as potential drug targets that could be expected for approval."
38762584,Invariant gammadeltaTCR natural killer-like effector T cells in the naked mole-rat.,"The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a long-lived rodent species showing resistance to the development of cancer. Although naked mole-rats have been reported to lack natural killer (NK) cells, gammadelta T cell-based immunity has been suggested in this species, which could represent an important arm of the immune system for antitumor responses. Here, we investigate the biology of these unconventional T cells in peripheral tissues (blood, spleen) and thymus of the naked mole-rat at different ages by TCR repertoire profiling and single-cell gene expression analysis. Using our own TCR annotation in the naked mole-rat genome, we report that the gammadelta TCR repertoire is dominated by a public invariant Vgamma4-2/Vdelta1-4 TCR, containing the complementary-determining-region-3 (CDR3)gamma CTYWDSNYAKKLF / CDR3delta CALWELRTGGITAQLVF that are likely generated by short-homology-repeat-driven DNA rearrangements. This invariant TCR is specifically found in gammadelta T cells expressing genes associated with NK cytotoxicity and is generated in both the thoracic and cervical thymus of the naked mole-rat until adult life. Our results indicate that invariant Vgamma4-2/Vdelta1-4 NK-like effector T cells in the naked mole-rat can contribute to tumor immunosurveillance by gammadelta TCR-mediated recognition of a common molecular signal."
38760413,"Assessment of TROP2, CEACAM5 and DLL3 in metastatic prostate cancer: Expression landscape and molecular correlates.","Therapeutic approaches targeting proteins on the surface of cancer cells have emerged as an important strategy for precision oncology. To capitalize on the potential impact of drugs targeting surface proteins, detailed knowledge about the expression patterns of the target proteins in tumor tissues is required. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), agents targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have demonstrated clinical activity. However, PSMA expression is lost in a significant number of CRPC tumors. The identification of additional cell surface targets is necessary to develop new therapeutic approaches. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression heterogeneity and co-expression patterns of trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2), delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) in CRPC samples from a rapid autopsy cohort. We show that DLL3 and CEACAM5 exhibit the highest expression in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), while TROP2 is expressed across different CRPC molecular subtypes, except for NEPC. We further demonstrated that AR alterations were associated with higher expression of PSMA and TROP2. Conversely, PSMA and TROP2 expression was lower in RB1-altered tumors. In addition to genomic alterations, we show a tight correlation between epigenetic states, particularly histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) at the transcriptional start site and gene body of TACSTD2 (encoding TROP2), DLL3, and CEACAM5, and their respective protein expression in CRPC patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, these findings provide insights into patterns and determinants of expression of TROP2, DLL3, and CEACAM5 with implications for the clinical development of cell surface targeting agents in CRPC."
38760387,Radiomic profiles improve prognostication and reveal targets for therapy in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a major global health problem with 570,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths annually. Prognosis is poor for advanced stage disease, and few effective treatments exist. Preoperative diagnostic imaging is common in high-income countries and MRI measured tumor size routinely guides treatment allocation of cervical cancer patients. Recently, the role of MRI radiomics has been recognized. However, its potential to independently predict survival and treatment response requires further clarification. This retrospective cohort study demonstrates how non-invasive, preoperative, MRI radiomic profiling may improve prognostication and tailoring of treatments and follow-ups for cervical cancer patients. By unsupervised clustering based on 293 radiomic features from 132 patients, we identify three distinct clusters comprising patients with significantly different risk profiles, also when adjusting for FIGO stage and age. By linking their radiomic profiles to genomic alterations, we identify putative treatment targets for the different patient clusters (e.g., immunotherapy, CDK4/6 and YAP-TEAD inhibitors and p53 pathway targeting treatments)."
38759121,Long-Term Analysis of NRG Oncology RTOG 0415: A Randomized Phase III Noninferiority Study Comparing Two Fractionation Schedules in Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.,"Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.NRG Oncology RTOG 0415 is a randomized phase III noninferiority (NI) clinical trial comparing conventional fractionation (73.8 Gy in 41 fractions) radiotherapy (C-RT) with hypofractionation (H-RT; 70 Gy in 28) in patients with low-risk prostate cancer. The study included 1,092 protocol-eligible patients initially reported in 2016 with a median follow-up of 5.8 years. Updated results with median follow-up of 12.8 years are now presented. The estimated 12-year disease-free survival (DFS) is 56.1% (95% CI, 51.5 to 60.5) for C-RT and 61.8% (95% CI, 57.2 to 66.0) for H-RT. The DFS hazard ratio (H-RT/C-RT) is 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.03), confirming NI (P < .001). Twelve-year cumulative incidence of biochemical failure (BF) was 17.0% (95% CI, 13.8 to 20.5) for C-RT and 9.9% (95% CI, 7.5 to 12.6) for H-RT. The HR (H-RT/C-RT) comparing biochemical recurrence between the two arms was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.78). Late grade >/=3 GI adverse event (AE) incidence is 3.2% (C-RT) versus 4.4% (H-RT), with relative risk (RR) for H-RT versus C-RT 1.39 (95% CI, 0.75 to 2.55). Late grade >/=3 genitourinary (GU) AE incidence is 3.4% (C-RT) versus 4.2% (H-RT), RR 1.26 (95% CI, 0.69 to 2.30). Long-term DFS is noninferior with H-RT compared with C-RT. BF is less with H-RT. No significant differences in late grade >/=3 GI/GU AEs were observed between assignments (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00331773)."
38759092,Large-Scale Alternative Polyadenylation-Wide Association Studies to Identify Putative Cancer Susceptibility Genes.,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) modulates mRNA processing in the 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTR), affecting mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Research into genetically regulated APA has the potential to provide insights into cancer risk. In this study, we conducted large APA-wide association studies to investigate associations between APA levels and cancer risk. Genetic models were built to predict APA levels in multiple tissues using genotype and RNA sequencing data from 1,337 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Associations of genetically predicted APA levels with cancer risk were assessed by applying the prediction models to data from large genome-wide association studies of six common cancers among European ancestry populations: breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers. A total of 58 risk genes (corresponding to 76 APA sites) were associated with at least one type of cancer, including 25 genes previously not linked to cancer susceptibility. Of the identified risk APAs, 97.4% and 26.3% were supported by 3'-UTR APA quantitative trait loci and colocalization analyses, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays for four selected putative regulatory 3'-UTR variants demonstrated that the risk alleles of 3'-UTR variants, rs324015 (STAT6), rs2280503 (DIP2B), rs1128450 (FBXO38), and rs145220637 (LDHA), significantly increased the posttranscriptional activities of their target genes compared with reference alleles. Furthermore, knockdown of the target genes confirmed their ability to promote proliferation and migration. Overall, this study provides insights into the role of APA in the genetic susceptibility to common cancers. Significance: Systematic evaluation of associations of alternative polyadenylation with cancer risk reveals 58 putative susceptibility genes, highlighting the contribution of genetically regulated alternative polyadenylation of 3'UTRs to genetic susceptibility to cancer."
38756662,Increased co-expression of 4-1BB with PD-1 on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with improved prognosis and immunotherapy response in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The combination of agonistic antibodies with immune checkpoint inhibitors presents a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy. Our objective is to explore the co-expression of 4-1BB, ICOS, CD28, with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissue of cervical cancer(CC) patients, with a specific focus on the association between the co-expression levels of 4-1BB with PD-1 and clinical features, prognosis as well as immunotherapy response. The goal is to offer valuable insights into cervical cancer immunotherapy. METHODS: In this study, 50 treatment-naive patients diagnosed with CC were enrolled. Flow cytometry was used to detect PD-1/4-1BB, PD-1/ICOS and PD-1/CD28 co-expression on CD8+ T cells. Subsequent analysis aimed to investigate the differential co-expression between peripheral blood and cancer tissue, and also the correlation between co-expression and clinical features in these patients. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, The IMvigor210 cohort, The BMS038cohort and Immunophenoscores were utilized to investigate the correlation between PD-1/4-1BB and the immune microenvironment, prognosis, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity in cervical cancer. RESULTS: The co-expression levels of PD-1/4-1BB, PD-1/ICOS, and PD-1/CD28 on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were significantly higher in cervical cancer patients compared to those in peripheral blood. Clinical feature analysis reveals that on CD8+ TILs, the co-expression of PD-1/4-1BB is more closely correlated with clinical characteristics compared to PD-1/ICOS, PD-1/CD28, PD-1, and 4-1BB. Pseudo-time analysis and cell communication profiling reveal close associations between the subgroups harboring 4-1BB and PD-1. The prognosis, tumor mutation burden, immune landscape, and immunotherapy response exhibit statistically significant variations between the high and low co-expression groups of PD-1/4-1BB. The high co-expression group of PD-1/4-1BB is more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: PD-1/4-1BB, PD-1/ICOS, and PD-1/CD28 exhibit elevated co-expression on CD8+TILs of cervical cancer, while demonstrating lower expression in circulating T cells. The co-expression patterns of PD-1/4-1BB significantly contributed to the prediction of immune cell infiltration characteristics, prognosis, and tailored immunotherapy tactics. PD-1/4-1BB exhibits potential as a target for combination immunotherapy in cervical cancer."
38755429,Molecular analysis for ovarian cancer detection in patient-friendly samples.,"BACKGROUND: High ovarian cancer mortality rates motivate the development of effective and patient-friendly diagnostics. Here, we explored the potential of molecular testing in patient-friendly samples for ovarian cancer detection. METHODS: Home-collected urine, cervicovaginal self-samples, and clinician-taken cervical scrapes were prospectively collected from 54 patients diagnosed with a highly suspicious ovarian mass (benign n = 25, malignant n = 29). All samples were tested for nine methylation markers, using quantitative methylation-specific PCRs that were verified on ovarian tissue samples, and compared to non-paired patient-friendly samples of 110 age-matched healthy controls. Copy number analysis was performed on a subset of urine samples of ovarian cancer patients by shallow whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: Three methylation markers are significantly elevated in full void urine of ovarian cancer patients as compared to healthy controls (C2CD4D, P = 0.008; CDO1, P = 0.022; MAL, P = 0.008), of which two are also discriminatory in cervical scrapes (C2CD4D, P = 0.001; CDO1, P = 0.004). When comparing benign and malignant ovarian masses, GHSR shows significantly elevated methylation levels in the urine sediment of ovarian cancer patients (P = 0.024). Other methylation markers demonstrate comparably high methylation levels in benign and malignant ovarian masses. Cervicovaginal self-samples show no elevated methylation levels in patients with ovarian masses as compared to healthy controls. Copy number changes are identified in 4 out of 23 urine samples of ovarian cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals increased methylation levels of ovarian cancer-associated genes and copy number aberrations in the urine of ovarian cancer patients. Our findings support continued research into urine biomarkers for ovarian cancer detection and highlight the importance of including benign ovarian masses in future studies to develop a clinically useful test."
38755259,Compositional and functional differences of the vaginal microbiota of women with and without cervical dysplasia.,"Alterations in the vaginal microbiota, including both species composition and functional pathways, have been associated with HPV infection and progression of dysplasia to cervical cancer. To further explore this, shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to taxonomically and functionally characterize the vaginal microbiota of women with and without cervical dysplasia. Women with histologically verified dysplasia (n = 177; low grade dysplasia (LSIL) n = 81, high-grade dysplasia (HSIL) n = 94, cancer n = 2) were compared with healthy controls recruited from the cervical screening programme (n = 177). Women with dysplasia had a higher vaginal microbial diversity, and higher abundances of Gardnerella vaginalis, Aerococcus christensenii, Peptoniphilus lacrimalis and Fannyhessea vaginae, while healthy controls had higher relative abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus. Genes involved in e.g. nucleotide biosynthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were more abundant in women with dysplasia. Healthy controls showed higher abundance of genes important for e.g. amino acid biosynthesis, (especially L-lysine) and sugar degradation. These findings suggest that the microbiota may have a role in creating a pro-oncogenic environment in women with dysplasia. Its role and potential interactions with other components in the microenvironment deserve further exploration."
38755095,Short-term Darolutamide (ODM-201) Concomitant to Radiation Therapy for Patients with Unfavorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: The Darius (AFU-GETUG P15) Phase 2 Trial Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a standard of care for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, 6 months of ADT generates multiple side effects impacting quality of life (QoL). Darolutamide (an androgen receptor targeting agent [ARTA]) is associated with low blood-brain barrier penetrance and less drug-drug interaction. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a combination of 6 months of darolutamide with EBRT to treat patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The DARIUS trial is a multicenter randomized non comparative phase 2 trial, randomizing the 6-months darolutamide + EBRT arm versus 6-months ADT + EBRT in patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk PCa. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint is a biological response defined as prostate-specific antigen </=0.1 ng/ml at month six of darolutamide or ADT. The key secondary endpoints are biochemical recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival, safety, and QoL. Ancillary studies using radiomics and genomic classifier are planned. Sixty-two patients will be included. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In this population of patients requiring ADT combined with EBRT, the use of an ARTA alone, such as darolutamide, may demonstrate antitumoral efficacy while minimizing toxicity and maintaining QoL. Limitations are mainly inherent to the open-label design of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Six months of darolutamide + EBRT compared with 6 months of ADT + EBRT may be efficient in terms of a biological response, avoiding toxicity and altered QoL attributable to ADT in patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: The ongoing DARIUS clinical trial assesses short-term (6 months) darolutamide treatment in association with external beam radiation therapy in men with localized prostate cancer. The trial investigates whether single-agent darolutamide can improve the biological response while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile."
38751947,The association between pre-diagnostic levels of psychological distress and adverse effects after radical prostatectomy.,"OBJECTIVES: To prospectively analyse the associations between pre-diagnostic levels of anxiety and depression and patient-reported urinary and sexual adverse effects after radical prostatectomy in a population-based setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In three Norwegian county hospitals, men referred with a suspicion of prostate cancer were asked to fill out a patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) questionnaire prior to prostate biopsy. Those who later underwent radical prostatectomy were stratified into three distress groups according to their Hopkins Symptom Checklist 5-score. Additional PROM questionnaires, including the EPIC-26 to measure adverse effects, were collected at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Multivariable mixed models were estimated and post hoc pairwise comparisons performed to explore differences in adverse effects between distress groups. RESULTS: A total of 416 men were included at baseline and of those, 365 (88%) returned questionnaires at 6 months and 360 (87%) at 12 months. After adjusting for confounders, men with high distress at baseline had worse urinary incontinence domain score (58.9 vs. 66.8, p = 0.028), more urinary bother (64.7 vs. 73.6, p = 0.04) and a higher risk of using incontinence pads (70.6% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.034) at 6 months than those with low distress. There was no difference in the sexual domain scores between distress groups postoperatively, but the high-distress group expressed more sexual bother (24.9 vs. 37.5, p = 0.015) and the intermediate-distress group had a greater probability of using sexual medications or devices (63.8% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.015) than the low-distress group at 6 months. At 12 months scores generally improved slightly and differences between distress groups were less evident. CONCLUSION: Men with higher levels of anxiety and depression before prostate biopsy report more urinary and sexual adverse effects after radical prostatectomy. This should be considered both in treatment decision-making and during follow-up after radical prostatectomy."
38751776,ProstaMine: a bioinformatics tool for identifying subtype-specific co-alterations associated with aggressiveness in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men, marked by heterogeneous clinical and molecular characteristics. The complexity of the molecular landscape necessitates tools for identifying multi-gene co-alteration patterns that are associated with aggressive disease. The identification of such gene sets will allow for deeper characterization of the processes underlying prostate cancer progression and potentially lead to novel strategies for treatment. METHODS: We developed ProstaMine to systematically identify co-alterations associated with aggressiveness in prostate cancer molecular subtypes defined by high-fidelity alterations in primary prostate cancer. ProstaMine integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from five primary and one metastatic prostate cancer cohorts to prioritize co-alterations enriched in metastatic disease and associated with disease progression. RESULTS: Integrated analysis of primary tumors defined a set of 17 prostate cancer alterations associated with aggressive characteristics. We applied ProstaMine to NKX3-1-loss and RB1-loss tumors and identified subtype-specific co-alterations associated with metastasis and biochemical relapse in these molecular subtypes. In NKX3-1-loss prostate cancer, ProstaMine identified novel subtype-specific co-alterations known to regulate prostate cancer signaling pathways including MAPK, NF-kB, p53, PI3K, and Sonic hedgehog. In RB1-loss prostate cancer, ProstaMine identified novel subtype-specific co-alterations involved in p53, STAT6, and MHC class I antigen presentation. Co-alterations impacting autophagy were noted in both molecular subtypes. CONCLUSION: ProstaMine is a method to systematically identify novel subtype-specific co-alterations associated with aggressive characteristics in prostate cancer. The results from ProstaMine provide insights into potential subtype-specific mechanisms of prostate cancer progression which can be formed into testable experimental hypotheses. ProstaMine is publicly available at: https://bioinformatics.cuanschutz.edu/prostamine."
38750579,Novel frontiers in urogenital cancers: from molecular bases to preclinical models to tailor personalized treatments in ovarian and prostate cancer patients.,"Over the last few decades, the incidence of urogenital cancers has exhibited diverse trends influenced by screening programs and geographical variations. Among women, there has been a consistent or even increased occurrence of endometrial and ovarian cancers; conversely, prostate cancer remains one of the most diagnosed malignancies, with a rise in reported cases, partly due to enhanced and improved screening efforts.Simultaneously, the landscape of cancer therapeutics has undergone a remarkable evolution, encompassing the introduction of targeted therapies and significant advancements in traditional chemotherapy. Modern targeted treatments aim to selectively address the molecular aberrations driving cancer, minimizing adverse effects on normal cells. However, traditional chemotherapy retains its crucial role, offering a broad-spectrum approach that, despite its wider range of side effects, remains indispensable in the treatment of various cancers, often working synergistically with targeted therapies to enhance overall efficacy.For urogenital cancers, especially ovarian and prostate cancers, DNA damage response inhibitors, such as PARP inhibitors, have emerged as promising therapeutic avenues. In BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, PARP inhibitors like olaparib and niraparib have demonstrated efficacy, leading to their approval for specific indications. Similarly, patients with DNA damage response mutations have shown sensitivity to these agents in prostate cancer, heralding a new frontier in disease management. Furthermore, the progression of ovarian and prostate cancer is intricately linked to hormonal regulation. Ovarian cancer development has also been associated with prolonged exposure to estrogen, while testosterone and its metabolite dihydrotestosterone, can fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. Thus, understanding the interplay between hormones, DNA damage and repair mechanisms can hold promise for exploring novel targeted therapies for ovarian and prostate tumors.In addition, it is of primary importance the use of preclinical models that mirror as close as possible the biological and genetic features of patients' tumors in order to effectively translate novel therapeutic findings ""from the bench to the bedside"".In summary, the complex landscape of urogenital cancers underscores the need for innovative approaches. Targeted therapy tailored to DNA repair mechanisms and hormone regulation might offer promising avenues for improving the management and outcomes for patients affected by ovarian and prostate cancers."
38750489,HPV16-miRNAs exert oncogenic effects through enhancers in human cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease. HPV type 16 (HPV16), which is the predominant cause of cervical cancer, can encode miRNAs (HPV16-miRNAs). However, the role of HPV16-miRNAs in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer remains unclear. METHODS: Human cervical cancer cell lines SiHa (HPV16-positive) and C33A (HPV-negative), and cervical cancer tissues were collected to investigate the expression levels of two HPV16-miRNAs (HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6). The overexpression and knockdown of HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 were performed using the lentiviral vector system and miRNA inhibitors, respectively. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) experiments were utilized to explore the roles of HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 facilitated by enhancers. CCK8, EdU, transwell, and wound healing assays were performed to verify the effects of HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 on cell proliferation and migration. RESULTS: HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 were highly expressed in both SiHa cells and tissue samples from HPV16-positive cervical cancer patients. RNA-seq analysis showed that HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 induced the upregulation of numerous tumor progression-associated genes. H3K27ac CHIP-seq experiments further revealed that HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 modulated the expression of critical genes by regulating their enhancer activity. The functional study demonstrated that HPV16-miR-H1 and HPV16-miR-H6 increased the migratory capacity of SiHa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shed light on the role of HPV16-encoded miRNAs in cervical cancer, particularly emphasizing their involvement in the miRNA-enhancer-target gene system. This novel regulatory mechanism of HPV16-miRNAs provides new insights and approaches for the development of therapeutic strategies by targeting HPV16-positive cervical cancer."
38749770,Performance of an ancillary test for cervical cancer that measures miRNAs and cytokines in serum and cervical mucus.,"Currently, human papillomavirus tests and cytology are used to screen for cervical cancer. However, more accurate ancillary screening tests are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and cytokines are promising biomarkers that are aberrantly expressed in cervical cancer. Therefore, the potential of developing new screening markers based on the levels of miRNAs and cytokines in serum and local mucus samples from the same patients with cervical neoplasia was investigated. miRNA screening was performed by microarray and measurement using real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. Cytokine were measured using multiplex bead assay, and changes in expressions were analyzed based on disease severity. As lesions progressed, miR-20b-5p, -155-5p, -144-3p, -451a, and -126-3p expression levels were increased in mucus, and miR-16-5p, -223-3p, and -451a expression levels were decreased in serum. Regarding cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Eotaxin, interferon-gamma, and RANTES were increased, whereas granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly decreased in mucus. miRNAs and cytokines in serum did not have high diagnostic accuracy. However, a combination of miR-20b-5p, -451a, -126-3p, Eotaxin, as well as G-CSF in mucus samples, had high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.989 (0.979-0.999). Our results suggest that using mucus for this ancillary test is more beneficial than serum."
38748970,Using the Cell-Cycle Risk Score to Predict the Benefit of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy Added to Radiation Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend adding androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) to radiation therapy (RT) in certain patients with localized prostate cancer. Individualized genomic testing may improve the prognostic accuracy of risk assessments. Herein, we describe a mathematical model of the benefit of adding ADT to RT as a function of the personalized clinical cell-cycle risk (CCR) score to inform 10-year metastasis risk. METHODS: A model of absolute risk reduction (ARR) was built using a retrospective cohort of men tested with Prolaris who received RT alone (N = 467). The relative benefit of ADT added to RT to reduce distant metastasis was estimated at 41% on the basis of a meta-analysis of randomized trials. The ARR and number needed to treat (NNT) were computationally derived in patients clinically tested with Prolaris between January 1, 2020, and October 31, 2022 (N = 56,485). Risks were predicted using a cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model with CCR score predicting time to metastasis. A CCR score of 2.112 represents the validated multimodal treatment (MMT) threshold. RESULTS: The ARR from ADT increased from almost zero at low CCR scores to 17.1% at CCR = 3.690 with the corresponding NNT = 6, indicating that adding ADT to RT would prevent metastasis within 10 years for one of every six treated individuals. In the clinical cohort, the average ARR was 0.86% in individuals under the MMT threshold (NNT = 116). The average ARR was 8.19% in individuals above the MMT threshold (NNT = 12). Broad ranges of ADT benefit were observed within National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk categories. CONCLUSION: The precise and personalized risk estimate of metastasis provided by the CCR score can help inform patients and physicians when considering treatment intensification."
38748947,Prospective Study of Homologous Recombination Repair Gene Mutation Prevalence in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer From Latin America: Challenges and Future Approaches.,"PURPOSE: The prevalence of homologous recombination repair gene mutations (HRRm) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is unknown. Prevalence of homologous Recombination repair (HRR) gene mutatiOns in patientS with metastatic castration resistant ProstatE Cancer in LaTin America (PROSPECT) aimed to determine this prevalence and to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study across 11 cancer centers in seven LAC countries. After informed consent, all eligible participants underwent genomic testing by provided blood samples for germline HRR testing; they also provided PC tissue blocks if available for somatic HRR testing. RESULTS: Between April 2021 and April 2022, 387 patients (median age, 70 years [49-89], 94.3% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) with mCRPC were enrolled in the study. Almost 40% of them had a family history of cancer, and the overall time from their initial PC and mCRPC diagnosis was 3 years and 1 year, respectively. The overall prevalence of germline HRRm was 4.2%. The mutations detected included the genes CHEK2 (n = 4, 1%), ATM (n = 3, 0.8%), BRCA2 (n = 3, 0.8%), BRIP1 (n = 2, 0.5%), RAD51B (n = 2, 0.5%), BRCA1 (n = 1, 0.3%), and MRE11 (n = 1, 0.3%). The prevalence of somatic HRRm could not be assessed because of high HRR testing failure rates (79%, 199/251) associated with insufficient DNA, absence of tumor cells, and poor-quality DNA. CONCLUSION: Despite the study's limitations, to our knowledge, PROSPECT was the first attempt to describe the prevalence of HRRm in patients with PC from LAC. Notably, the germline HRRm prevalence in this study was inferior to that observed in North American and European populations. The somatic HRR testing barriers identified are being addressed by several projects to improve access to HRR testing and biomarker-based therapies in LAC."
38748808,Cervical extracellular matrix hydrogel optimizes tumor heterogeneity of cervical squamous cell carcinoma organoids.,"Cervical cancer, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy. Organoids can mimic tumor development in vitro, but current Matrigel inaccurately replicates the tissue-specific microenvironment. This limitation compromises the accurate representation of tumor heterogeneity. We collected para-cancerous cervical tissues from patients diagnosed with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and prepared uterine cervix extracellular matrix (UCEM) hydrogels. Proteomic analysis of UCEM identified several tissue-specific signaling pathways including human papillomavirus, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT, and extracellular matrix receptor. Secreted proteins like FLNA, MYH9, HSPA8, and EEF1A1 were present, indicating UCEM successfully maintained cervical proteins. UCEM provided a tailored microenvironment for CSCC organoids, enabling formation and growth while preserving tumorigenic potential. RNA sequencing showed UCEM-organoids exhibited greater similarity to native CSCC and reflected tumor heterogeneity by exhibiting CSCC-associated signaling pathways including virus protein-cytokine, nuclear factor kappaB, tumor necrosis factor, and oncogenes EGR1, FPR1, and IFI6. Moreover, UCEM-organoids developed chemotherapy resistance. Our research provides insights into advanced organoid technology through native matrix hydrogels."
38747609,mSphere of Influence: Retreading old ground-the beauty in multi-omic data sets.,"Ethan L. Morgan works on human papillomaviruses (HPVs), with a specific interest in identifying how HPV induces tumor formation. In this mSphere of Influence article, he reflects on how three papers influenced him. ""Comprehensive genomic characterization of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas"" (The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, Nature 517:576-582, 2015, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14129) and ""Integrated genomic and molecular characterization of cervical cancer"" (The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, Nature 543: 378-384, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature21386) showed him the power behind comprehensive multi-omic analyses to understand disease biology, while ""Human papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein targets RNF168 to hijack the host DNA damage response"" (J. Sitz et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 116:19552-19562, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906102116) reinforced how this can be used to undercover potential new drug targets in HPV-associated disease."
38746150,Unveiling Novel Double-Negative Prostate Cancer Subtypes Through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis.,"Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) have facilitated the discovery of previously unrecognized subtypes within prostate cancer (PCa), offering new insights into disease heterogeneity and progression. In this study, we integrated scRNAseq data from multiple studies, comprising both publicly available cohorts and data generated by our research team, and established the HuPSA (Human Prostate Single cell Atlas) and the MoPSA (Mouse Prostate Single cell Atlas) datasets. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified two novel double-negative PCa populations: KRT7 cells characterized by elevated KRT7 expression, and progenitor-like cells marked by SOX2 and FOXA2 expression, distinct from NEPCa, and displaying stem/progenitor features. Furthermore, HuPSA-based deconvolution allowed for the re-classification of human PCa specimens, validating the presence of these novel subtypes. Leveraging these findings, we developed a user-friendly web application, ""HuPSA-MoPSA"" (https://pcatools.shinyapps.io/HuPSA-MoPSA/), for visualizing gene expression across all newly-established datasets. Our study provides comprehensive tools for PCa research and uncovers novel cancer subtypes that can inform clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies."
38745123,Common variation in a long non-coding RNA gene modulates variation of circulating TGF-beta2 levels in metastatic colorectal cancer patients (Alliance).,"BACKGROUND: Herein, we report results from a genome-wide study conducted to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for circulating angiogenic and inflammatory protein markers in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study was conducted using genotype, protein marker, and baseline clinical and demographic data from CALGB/SWOG 80405 (Alliance), a randomized phase III study designed to assess outcomes of adding VEGF or EGFR inhibitors to systemic chemotherapy in mCRC patients. Germline DNA derived from blood was genotyped on whole-genome array platforms. The abundance of protein markers was quantified using a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from plasma derived from peripheral venous blood collected at baseline. A robust rank-based method was used to assess the statistical significance of each variant and protein pair against a strict genome-wide level. A given pQTL was tested for validation in two external datasets of prostate (CALGB 90401) and pancreatic cancer (CALGB 80303) patients. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to further establish biological bases for these findings. RESULTS: The final analysis was carried out based on data from 540,021 common typed genetic variants and 23 protein markers from 869 genetically estimated European patients with mCRC. Correcting for multiple testing, the analysis discovered a novel cis-pQTL in LINC02869, a long non-coding RNA gene, for circulating TGF-beta2 levels (rs11118119; AAF = 0.11; P-value < 1.4e-14). This finding was validated in a cohort of 538 prostate cancer patients from CALGB 90401 (AAF = 0.10, P-value < 3.3e-25). The analysis also validated a cis-pQTL we had previously reported for VEGF-A in advanced pancreatic cancer, and additionally identified trans-pQTLs for VEGF-R3, and cis-pQTLs for CD73. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided evidence of a novel cis germline genetic variant that regulates circulating TGF-beta2 levels in plasma of patients with advanced mCRC and prostate cancer. Moreover, the validation of previously identified pQTLs for VEGF-A, CD73, and VEGF-R3, potentiates the validity of these associations."
38743035,"Maramycin, a Cytotoxic Isoquinolinequinone Terpenoid Produced through Heterologous Expression of a Bifunctional Indole Prenyltransferase/Tryptophan Indole-Lyase in S. albidoflavus.","Isoquinolinequinones represent an important family of natural alkaloids with profound biological activities. Heterologous expression of a rare bifunctional indole prenyltransferase/tryptophan indole-lyase enzyme from Streptomyces mirabilis P8-A2 in S. albidoflavus J1074 led to the activation of a putative isoquinolinequinone biosynthetic gene cluster and production of a novel isoquinolinequinone alkaloid, named maramycin (1). The structure of maramycin was determined by analysis of spectroscopic (1D/2D NMR) and MS spectrometric data. The prevalence of this bifunctional biosynthetic enzyme was explored and found to be a recent evolutionary event with only a few representatives in nature. Maramycin exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2B. The discovery of maramycin (1) enriched the chemical diversity of natural isoquinolinequinones and also provided new insights into crosstalk between the host biosynthetic genes and the heterologous biosynthetic genes in generating new chemical scaffolds."
38740014,comorbidPGS: An R Package Assessing Shared Predisposition between Phenotypes Using Polygenic Scores.,"INTRODUCTION: Polygenic score (PGS) is a valuable method for assessing the estimated genetic liability to a given outcome or genetic variability contributing to a quantitative trait. While polygenic risk scores are widely used for complex traits, their application in uncovering shared genetic predisposition between phenotypes, i.e., when genetic variants influence more than one phenotype, remains limited. METHODS: We developed an R package, comorbidPGS, which facilitates a systematic evaluation of shared genetic effects among (cor)related phenotypes using PGSs. The comorbidPGS package takes as input a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms along with their established effects on the original phenotype (Po), referred to as Po-PGS. It generates a comprehensive summary of effect(s) of Po-PGS on target phenotype(s) (Pt) with customisable graphical features. RESULTS: We applied comorbidPGS to investigate the shared genetic predisposition between phenotypes defining elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, SBP; diastolic blood pressure, DBP; pulse pressure) and several cancers (breast cancer; pancreatic cancer, PanC; kidney cancer, KidC; prostate cancer, PrC; colorectal cancer, CrC) using the European ancestry UK Biobank individuals and GWAS meta-analyses summary statistics from independent set of European ancestry individuals. We report a significant association between elevated DBP and the genetic risk of PrC (beta [SE] = 0.066 [0.017], p value = 9.64 x 10-5), as well as between CrC PGS and both, lower SBP (beta [SE] = -0.10 [0.029], p value = 3.83 x 10-4) and lower DBP (beta [SE] = -0.055 [0.017], p value = 1.05 x 10-3). Our analysis highlights two nominally significant relationships for individuals with genetic predisposition to elevated SBP leading to higher risk of KidC (OR [95% CI] = 1.04 [1.0039-1.087], p value = 2.82 x 10-2) and PrC (OR [95% CI] = 1.02 [1.003-1.041], p value = 2.22 x 10-2). CONCLUSION: Using comorbidPGS, we underscore mechanistic relationships between blood pressure regulation and susceptibility to three comorbid malignancies. This package offers valuable means to evaluate shared genetic susceptibility between (cor)related phenotypes through polygenic scores."
38739617,Identification and Quantification of Human Relaxin Proteins by Immunoaffinity-Mass Spectrometry.,"The human relaxins belong to the Insulin/IGF/Relaxin superfamily of peptide hormones, and their physiological function is primarily associated with reproduction. In this study, we focused on a prostate tissue-specific relaxin RLN1 (REL1_HUMAN protein) and a broader tissue specificity RLN2 (REL2_HUMAN protein). Due to their structural similarity, REL1 and REL2 proteins were collectively named a 'human relaxin protein' in previous studies and were exclusively measured by immunoassays. We hypothesized that the highly selective and sensitive immunoaffinity-selected reaction monitoring (IA-SRM) assays would reveal the identity and abundance of the endogenous REL1 and REL2 in biological samples and facilitate the evaluation of these proteins for diagnostic applications. High levels of RLN1 and RLN2 transcripts were found in prostate and breast cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. However, no endogenous prorelaxin-1 or mature REL1 were detected by IA-SRM in cell lines, seminal plasma, or blood serum. The IA-SRM assay of REL2 demonstrated its undetectable levels (<9.4 pg/mL) in healthy control female and male sera and relatively high levels of REL2 in maternal sera across different gestational weeks (median 331 pg/mL; N = 120). IA-SRM assays uncovered potential cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding for relaxin immunoassays. The developed IA-SRM assays will facilitate the investigation of the physiological and pathological roles of REL1 and REL2 proteins."
38738954,Navigating the evolving diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.,"In this nonsystematic review of the literature, we explored the changing landscape of detection and treatment of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Through emphasizing improved cancer assessment with histology classification and genomics, we investigated key developments in PCa detection and risk stratification. The pivotal role of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the novel diagnostic pathway is examined, alongside the benefits and drawbacks of MRI-targeted biopsies for detection and tumor characterization. We also delved into treatment options, particularly active surveillance for intermediate-risk PCa. Outcomes are compared between intermediate- and low-risk patients, offering insights into tailored management. Surgical techniques, including Retzius-sparing surgery, precision prostatectomy, and partial prostatectomy for anterior cancer, are appraised. Each technique has the potential to enhance outcomes and minimize complications. Advancements in technology and radiobiology, including computed tomography (CT)/MRI imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) fusion, allow for precise dose adjustment and daily target monitoring with imaging-guided radiotherapy, opening new ways of tailoring patients' treatments. Finally, experimental therapeutic approaches such as focal therapy open new treatment frontiers, although they create new needs in tumor identification and tracking during and after the procedure."
38737688,Development and validation of a prognostic prediction model for cervical cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy: a study based on TCGA database.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced or inoperable cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). However, treatment failure for CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy still occurs due to local recurrence and distant metastasis. The previous prediction models were focused on all CESC patients, neglecting the prognostic differences under different treatment modalities. Therefore, there is a pressing demand to explore novel biomarkers for the prognosis and sensitivity of radiotherapy in CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy. As a single biomarker has limited effect in stratifying these patients, our objective was to identify radioresponse-related mRNAs to ameliorate forecast of the prognosis for CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy. METHODS: Sample data on CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We randomly separated these patients into a training and test cohorts using a 1:1 ratio. Differential expression analysis was carried out to identify radioresponse-related mRNA sets that were significantly dysregulated between complete response (CR) and radiographic progressive disease (RPD) groups, and univariate Cox regression analyses, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and multivariate Cox regression were performed to identify the radioresponse-related signature in the training cohort. we adopted survival analysis to measure the predictive value of the radioresponse-related signature both in the test and entire cohorts. Moreover, we developed a novel nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) of CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy. In addition, immune infiltration analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were conducted to preliminarily explore possible mechanisms. RESULTS: This study included a total of 92 CESC patients subjected to radical radiotherapy. We developed and verified a risk score model based on radioresponse-related mRNA. The radioresponse-related mRNA signature and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage were served as independent prognostic factors for CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy. Moreover, a nomogram integrating radioresponse-related mRNA signature with FIGO stage was established to perform better for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates. Mechanically, the low-risk group under the risk score of this model had a better survival status, and the distribution of CD4 T cells was potentially involved in the regulation of radiotherapy response in CESC, leading to a better survival outcome in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a new radioresponse-related mRNA signature that shows promising clinical efficacy in predicting the prognosis of CESC patients treated with radical radiotherapy."
38735779,Differences in Tumor Gene Expression Profiles Between De Novo Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer and Metastatic Relapse After Prior Localized Therapy.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that patients with de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (dn-mCSPC) have worse prognosis and outcomes than those whose cancer relapses after prior local therapy (PLT-mCSPC). Our aim was to interrogate and validate underlying differences in tumor gene expression profiles between dn-mCSPC and PLT-mCSPC. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma and the availability of RNA sequencing data for treatment-naive primary prostate tissue. RNA sequencing was performed by Tempus or Caris Life Sciences, both of which have Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certification. The Tempus cohort was used for interrogation, while the Caris cohort was used for validation. Differential gene expression analysis between the cohorts was conducted using the DEseq2 pipeline. The resulting gene expression profiles were further analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment software to identify pathways with enrichment in each cohort. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 128 patients were eligible, of whom 78 were in the Tempus cohort (dn-mCSPC 37, PLT-mCSPC 41) and 50 were in the Caris cohort (dn-mCSPC 30, PLT-mCSPC 20). Tumor tissues from patients with dn-mCSPC had higher expression of genes associated with inflammation pathways, while tissues from patients with PLT-mCSPC had higher expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and androgen response pathways. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study revealed upregulation of distinct genomic pathways in dn-mCSPC in comparison to PLT-mCSPC. These hypothesis-generating data could guide personalized therapy for men with prostate cancer and explain different survival outcomes for dn-mCSPC and PLT-mCSPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We measured gene expression levels in tumors from patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. In patients with metastatic disease at first diagnosis, inflammatory pathways were upregulated. In patients whose metastasis occurred on relapse after treatment, androgen response pathways were upregulated. These findings could help in personalizing therapy for prostate cancer and explaining differences in survival."
38735382,Diverse landscape of genetically engineered mouse models: Genomic and molecular insights into prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant health concern for men worldwide and is particularly prevalent in the United States. It is a complex disease presenting different molecular subtypes and varying degrees of aggressiveness. Transgenic/genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) greatly enhanced our understanding of the intricate molecular processes that underlie PCa progression and have offered valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for this disease. The integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, along with expression profiling, has played a pivotal role in advancing GEMMs by facilitating the identification of genetic alterations driving PCa development. This review focuses on genetically modified mice classified into the first and second generations of PCa models. We summarize whether models created by manipulating the function of specific genes replicate the consequences of genomic alterations observed in human PCa, including early and later disease stages. We discuss cases where GEMMs did not fully exhibit the expected human PCa phenotypes and possible causes of the failure. Here, we summarize the comprehensive understanding, recent advances, strengths and limitations of the GEMMs in advancing our insights into PCa, offering genetic and molecular perspectives for developing novel GEMM models."
38734988,Overall and metastasis-free survival of Afro-Caribbean patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.,"INTRODUCTION: Early salvage radiotherapy is indicated for patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. However, for various reasons, certain patients do not benefit from this treatment (OBS) or only at a late stage (LSR). There are few studies on this subject and none on a ""high-risk"" population, such as patients of African descent. Our objective was to estimate the metastasis-free (MFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients who did not receive salvage radiotherapy, and to identify risk factors of disease progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study that included 154 patients, 99 in the OBS group and 55 in the LSR group. All were treated by total prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer between January 2000 and December 2020 and none received early salvage radiotherapy after biochemical recurrence. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for the time to biochemical recurrence. The median follow-up was 10.0 and 11.8 years for the OBS and LSR groups, respectively. The median time from surgery to LSR was 5.1 years. The two groups did not show a significant difference in MFS: 90.6% at 10 years for the OBS group and 93.3% for the LSR group. The median MFS was 19.8 and 19.6 years for the OBS and LSR groups respectively. OS for the OBS group was significantly higher than that for the LSR group (HR: 2.14 [1.07-4.29]; p = 0.03), with 10-year OS of 95.9% for the OBS group and 76.1% for the LSR group. Median OS was 16 and 15.6 years for the OBS and LSR groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed satisfactory metastasis-free and OS rates relative to those reported in the scientific literature. The challenge is not to question the benefit of early salvage radiotherapy, but to improve the identification of patients at risk of progression through the development of molecular and genomic tests for more highly personalized medicine."
38734542,Assessing the Clinical Utility of Published Prostate Cancer Polygenic Risk Scores in a Large Biobank Data Set.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have been developed to identify men with the highest risk of prostate cancer. Our aim was to compare the performance of 16 PRSs in identifying men at risk of developing prostate cancer and then to evaluate the performance of the top-performing PRSs in differentiating individuals at risk of aggressive prostate cancer. METHODS: For this case-control study we downloaded 16 published PRSs from the Polygenic Score Catalog on May 28, 2021 and applied them to Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) patients. Cases were matched to the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) registry to obtain granular clinical and pathological data. MGI prospectively enrolls patients undergoing surgery at the University of Michigan, and MUSIC is a multi-institutional registry that prospectively tracks demographic, treatment, and clinical variables. The predictive performance of each PRS was evaluated using the area under the covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic curve (aAUC), and the association between PRS and disease aggressiveness according to prostate biopsy data was measured using logistic regression. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 18 050 patients in the analysis, of whom 15 310 were control subjects and 2740 were prostate cancer cases. The median age was 66.1 yr (interquartile range 59.9-71.6) for cases and 56.6 yr (interquartile range 42.6-66.7) for control subjects. The PRS performance in predicting the risk of developing prostate cancer according to aAUC ranged from 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.51-0.53) to 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.68). By contrast, there was no association between PRS and disease aggressiveness. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Prostate cancer PRSs have modest real-world performance in identifying patients at higher risk of developing prostate cancer; however, they are limited in distinguishing patients with indolent versus aggressive disease. PATIENT SUMMARY: Risk scores using data for multiple genes (called polygenic risk scores) can identify men at higher risk of developing prostate cancer. However, these scores need to be refined to be able to identify men with the highest risk for clinically significant prostate cancer."
38734319,Integration of proteomic and metabolomic analysis reveal distinct metabolic alterations of prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts from patient's stroma samples.,"The prostate gland is a complex and heterogeneous organ composed of epithelium and stroma. Whilst many studies into prostate cancer focus on epithelium, the stroma is known to play a key role in disease with the emergence of a cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) phenotype associated upon disease progression. In this work, we studied the metabolic rewiring of stromal fibroblasts following differentiation to a cancer-associated, myofibroblast-like, phenotype. We determined that CAFs were metabolically more active compared to normal fibroblasts. This corresponded with a heightened lipogenic metabolism, as both reservoir species and building block compounds. Interestingly, lipid metabolism affects mitochondria functioning yet the mechanisms of lipid-mediated functions are unclear. Data showing oxidised fatty acids and glutathione system are elevated in CAFs, compared to normal fibroblasts, strengthens the hypothesis that increased metabolic activity is related to mitochondrial activity. This manuscript describes mechanisms responsible for the altered metabolic flux and shows that prostate cancer-derived extracellular vesicles can increase basal respiration in normal fibroblasts, mirroring that of the disease-like phenotype. This indicates that extracellular vesicles derived from prostate cancer cells may drive an altered oxygen-dependent metabolism associated to mitochondria in CAFs."
38733529,"Circular RNAs in EMT-driven metastasis regulation: modulation of cancer cell plasticity, tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.","The non-coding RNAs comprise a large part of human genome lack of capacity in encoding functional proteins. Among various members of non-coding RNAs, the circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been of importance in the pathogenesis of human diseases, especially cancer. The circRNAs have a unique closed loop structure and due to their stability, they are potential diagnostic and prognostic factors in cancer. The increasing evidences have highlighted the role of circRNAs in the modulation of proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. On the other hand, metastasis has been responsible for up to 90% of cancer-related deaths in patients, requiring more investigation regarding the underlying mechanisms modulating this mechanism. EMT enhances metastasis and invasion of tumor cells, and can trigger resistance to therapy. The cells demonstrate dynamic changes during EMT including transformation from epithelial phenotype into mesenchymal phenotype and increase in N-cadherin and vimentin levels. The process of EMT is reversible and its reprogramming can disrupt the progression of tumor cells. The aim of current review is to understanding the interaction of circRNAs and EMT in human cancers and such interaction is beyond the regulation of cancer metastasis and can affect the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The onco-suppressor circRNAs inhibit EMT, while the tumor-promoting circRNAs mediate EMT for acceleration of carcinogenesis. Moreover, the EMT-inducing transcription factors can be controlled by circRNAs in different human tumors."
38733362,Differential levels of circulating RNAs prior to endometrial cancer diagnosis.,"Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common female cancers and there is currently no routine screening strategy for early detection. An altered abundance of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and other RNA classes have the potential as early cancer biomarkers. We analyzed circulating RNA levels using small RNA sequencing, targeting RNAs in the size range of 17-47 nucleotides, in EC patients with samples collected prior to diagnosis compared to cancer-free controls. The analysis included 316 cases with samples collected 1-11 years prior to EC diagnosis, and 316 matched controls, both from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. We identified differentially abundant (DA) miRNAs, isomiRs, and small nuclear RNAs between EC cases and controls. The top EC DA miRNAs were miR-155-5p, miR-200b-3p, miR-589-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-543, miR-485-5p, miR-625-p, and miR-671-3p. miR-200b-3p was previously reported to be among one of the top miRNAs with higher abundance in EC cases. We observed 47, 41, and 32 DA miRNAs for EC interacting with BMI, smoking status, and physical activity, respectively, including two miRNAs (miR-223-3p and miR-29b-3p) interacting with all three factors. The circulating RNAs are altered and show temporal dynamics prior to EC diagnosis. Notably, DA miRNAs for EC had the lowest q-value 4.39-6.66 years before diagnosis. Enrichment analysis of miRNAs showed that signaling pathways Fc epsilon RI, prolactin, toll-like receptor, and VEGF had the strongest associations."
38732326,Advancing Evidence Generation for Circulating Tumor DNA: Lessons Learned from A Multi-Assay Study of Baseline Circulating Tumor DNA Levels across Cancer Types and Stages.,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker for predicting clinical responses to therapy in solid tumors, and multiple ctDNA assays are in development. However, the heterogeneity in ctDNA levels prior to treatment (baseline) across different cancer types and stages and across ctDNA assays has not been widely studied. Friends of Cancer Research formed a collaboration across multiple commercial ctDNA assay developers to assess baseline ctDNA levels across five cancer types in early- and late-stage disease. This retrospective study included eight commercial ctDNA assay developers providing summary-level de-identified data for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder, breast, prostate, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following a common analysis protocol. Baseline ctDNA levels across late-stage cancer types were similarly detected, highlighting the potential use of ctDNA as a biomarker in these cancer types. Variability was observed in ctDNA levels across assays in early-stage NSCLC, indicative of the contribution of assay analytical performance and methodology on variability. We identified key data elements, including assay characteristics and clinicopathological metadata, that need to be standardized for future meta-analyses across multiple assays. This work facilitates evidence generation opportunities to support the use of ctDNA as a biomarker for clinical response."
38732035,Unveiling the Genomic Landscape of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Using Spatial Gene Expression Analysis.,"Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP) has recently attracted increasing interest owing to its unfavorable prognoses. To effectively identify the IDCP-specific gene expression profile, we took a novel approach of characterizing a typical IDCP case using spatial gene expression analysis. A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sample was subjected to Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression analysis. IDCP within invasive prostate cancer sites was recognized as a distinct cluster separate from other invasive cancer clusters. Highly expressed genes defining the IDCP cluster, such as MUC6, MYO16, NPY, and KLK12, reflected the aggressive nature of high-grade prostate cancer. IDCP sites also showed increased hypoxia markers HIF1A, BNIP3L, PDK1, and POGLUT1; decreased fibroblast markers COL1A2, DCN, and LUM; and decreased immune cell markers CCR5 and FCGR3A. Overall, these findings indicate that the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and reduced recruitment of fibroblasts and immune cells, which reflect morphological features of IDCP, may influence the aggressiveness of high-grade prostate cancer."
38731844,Homologous Recombination Repair Deficiency in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities.,"More than 20% of metastatic prostate cancer carries genomic defects involving DNA damage repair pathways, mainly in homologous recombination repair-related genes. The recent approval of olaparib has paved the way to precision medicine for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with PARP inhibitors in this subset of patients, especially in the case of BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. In face of this new therapeutic opportunity, many issues remain unsolved. This narrative review aims to describe the relationship between homologous recombination repair deficiency and prostate cancer, the techniques used to determine homologous recombination repair status in prostate cancer, the crosstalk between homologous recombination repair and the androgen receptor pathway, the current evidence on PARP inhibitors activity in metastatic prostate cancer also in homologous recombination repair-proficient tumors, as well as emerging mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitors. The possibility of combination therapies including a PARP inhibitor is an attractive option, and more robust data are awaited from ongoing phase II and phase III trials outlined in this manuscript."
38730709,snRNAs from Radical Prostatectomy Specimens Have the Potential to Serve as Prognostic Factors for Clinical Recurrence after Biochemical Recurrence in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.,"In patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HRPC) after radical prostatectomy (RP), biochemical recurrence (BCR) increases the risk of distant metastasis. Accordingly, additional prognostic biomarkers are required to identify the subpopulation of patients with HRPC who develop clinical recurrence (CR) after BCR. The objective of this study was to identify biomarkers in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) RP samples that are prognostic for CR in patients with HRPC who experience BCR after RP (post-RP BCR). First, we performed a preliminary RNA sequencing analysis to comprehensively profile RNA expression in FFPE RP samples obtained from patients with HRPC who developed CR after post-RP BCR and found that many snRNAs were very abundant in preserved FFPE samples. Subsequently, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to compare the expression levels of highly abundant snRNAs in FFPE RP samples from patients with HRPC with and without CR after post-RP BCR (21 CR patients and 46 non-CR patients who had more than 5 years of follow-up after BCR). The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of snRNA RNU1-1/1-2 and RNU4-1 were significantly higher in patients with CR than in patients without CR. These snRNAs were significantly correlated with clinical recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with HRPC who experienced post-RP BCR. Furthermore, snRNA RNU1-1/1-2 could serve as an independent prognostic factor for clinical RFS in post-RP BCR of HRPC cases where known prognostic factors (e.g., Gleason score) cannot distinguish between CR and non-CR patients. Our findings provide new insights into the involvement of snRNAs in prostate cancer progression."
38730612,The Causes and Consequences of DNA Damage and Chromosomal Instability Induced by Human Papillomavirus.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the main cause of cervical, oropharyngeal, and anogenital cancers, which are all treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy when locally advanced. HPV proteins are known to exploit the host DNA damage response to enable viral replication and the epithelial differentiation protocol. This has far-reaching consequences for the host genome, as the DNA damage response is critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. HPV+ cells therefore have increased DNA damage, leading to widespread genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, which can contribute to tumorigenesis. Following transformation, high-risk HPV oncoproteins induce chromosomal instability, or chromosome missegregation during mitosis, which is associated with a further increase in DNA damage, particularly due to micronuclei and double-strand break formation. Thus, HPV induces significant DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage response in multiple contexts, which likely affects radiation sensitivity and efficacy. Here, we review how HPV activates the DNA damage response, how it induces chromosome missegregation and micronuclei formation, and discuss how these factors may affect radiation response. Understanding how HPV affects the DNA damage response in the context of radiation therapy may help determine potential mechanisms to improve therapeutic response."
38730581,Serum Proteomic Signatures in Cervical Cancer: Current Status and Future Directions.,"In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 604,000 new diagnoses of cervical cancer (CC) worldwide, and over 300,000 CC-related fatalities. The vast majority of CC cases are caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. HPV-related CC incidence and mortality rates have declined worldwide because of increased HPV vaccination and CC screening with the Papanicolaou test (PAP test). Despite these significant improvements, developing countries face difficulty implementing these programs, while developed nations are challenged with identifying HPV-independent cases. Molecular and proteomic information obtained from blood or tumor samples have a strong potential to provide information on malignancy progression and response to therapy in CC. There is a large amount of published biomarker data related to CC available but the extensive validation required by the FDA approval for clinical use is lacking. The ability of researchers to use the big data obtained from clinical studies and to draw meaningful relationships from these data are two obstacles that must be overcome for implementation into clinical practice. We report on identified multimarker panels of serum proteomic studies in CC for the past 5 years, the potential for modern computational biology efforts, and the utilization of nationwide biobanks to bridge the gap between multivariate protein signature development and the prediction of clinically relevant CC patient outcomes."
38730319,Keratin 17 modulates the immune topography of pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The immune microenvironment impacts tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and patient survival and may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although never studied as a potential modulator of the immune response in most cancers, Keratin 17 (K17), a biomarker of the most aggressive (basal) molecular subtype of PDAC, is intimately involved in the histogenesis of the immune response in psoriasis, basal cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, we hypothesized that K17 expression could also impact the immune cell response in PDAC, and that uncovering this relationship could provide insight to guide the development of immunotherapeutic opportunities to extend patient survival. METHODS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and automated image analysis based on novel computational imaging technology were used to decipher the abundance and spatial distribution of T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells, relative to K17 expression in 235 PDACs. RESULTS: K17 expression had profound effects on the exclusion of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and was also associated with decreased numbers of peritumoral CD8+ T cells, CD16+ macrophages, and CD163+ macrophages (p < 0.0001). The differences in the intratumor and peritumoral CD8+ T cell abundance were not impacted by neoadjuvant therapy, tumor stage, grade, lymph node status, histologic subtype, nor KRAS, p53, SMAD4, or CDKN2A mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, K17 expression correlates with major differences in the immune microenvironment that are independent of any tested clinicopathologic or tumor intrinsic variables, suggesting that targeting K17-mediated immune effects on the immune system could restore the innate immunologic response to PDAC and might provide novel opportunities to restore immunotherapeutic approaches for this most deadly form of cancer."
38730195,Exploration of the influence of GOLGA8B on prostate cancer progression and the resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer to cabazitaxel.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents the final stage of prostate cancer (PCa). Cabazitaxel, a taxane chemotherapy drug, is used in treating CRPC. However, patients with CRPC eventually develop resistance to cabazitaxel, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate potential genetic alterations that may play a role in CRPC resistance to cabazitaxel. Using microarray data from the GSE158494 dataset, we identified ten critical genes (CXCL8, ITGB8, CLIP4, MAP1B, WIPI1, MMP13, CXCL1, C1S, GOLGA8B, and CXCL6) associated with CRPC cell resistance to cabazitaxel. The potential function of these key genes in PCa progression was analyzed using different databases, including Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and Epigenome Atlas (CPGEA). Our findings revealed altered expression of these genes in the development of PCa. Furthermore, CXCL1 and GOLGA8B were found to influence the disease-free survival (DFS) status of patients with PCa, with GOLGA8B affecting the overall prognosis in patients with PCa. Additionally, GOLGA8B expression was associated with the infiltration of various immune cells in PCa, and it was upregulated in clinical PCa and CRPC samples. Through CCK-8 assays, we established that GOLGA8B could influence the sensitivity of CRPC cells to cabazitaxel and docetaxel. In conclusion, we identified GOLGA8B as a crucial gene that influences PCa progression and contributes to CRPC resistance to cabazitaxel."
38728474,Development and assessment of an RNA editing-based risk model for the prognosis of cervical cancer patients.,"RNA editing, as an epigenetic mechanism, exhibits a strong correlation with the occurrence and development of cancers. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of RNA editing on cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). In order to study the connection between RNA editing and CESC patients' prognoses, we obtained CESC-related information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and randomly allocated the patients into the training group or testing group. An RNA editing-based risk model for CESC patients was established by Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). According to the median score generated by this RNA editing-based risk model, patients were categorized into subgroups with high and low risks. We further constructed the nomogram by risk scores and clinical characteristics and analyzed the impact of RNA editing levels on host gene expression levels and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA. Finally, we also compared the biological functions and pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subgroups by enrichment analysis. In this risk model, we screened out 6 RNA editing sites with significant prognostic value. The constructed nomogram performed well in forecasting patients' prognoses. Furthermore, the level of RNA editing at the prognostic site exhibited a strong correlation with host gene expression. In the high-risk subgroup, we observed multiple biological functions and pathways associated with immune response, cell proliferation, and tumor progression. This study establishes an RNA editing-based risk model that helps forecast patients' prognoses and offers a new understanding of the underlying mechanism of RNA editing in CESC."
38724748,Direct transposition of native DNA for sensitive multimodal single-molecule sequencing.,"Concurrent readout of sequence and base modifications from long unamplified DNA templates by Pacific Biosciences of California (PacBio) single-molecule sequencing requires large amounts of input material. Here we adapt Tn5 transposition to introduce hairpin oligonucleotides and fragment (tagment) limiting quantities of DNA for generating PacBio-compatible circular molecules. We developed two methods that implement tagmentation and use 90-99% less input than current protocols: (1) single-molecule real-time sequencing by tagmentation (SMRT-Tag), which allows detection of genetic variation and CpG methylation; and (2) single-molecule adenine-methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay by tagmentation (SAMOSA-Tag), which uses exogenous adenine methylation to add a third channel for probing chromatin accessibility. SMRT-Tag of 40 ng or more human DNA (approximately 7,000 cell equivalents) yielded data comparable to gold standard whole-genome and bisulfite sequencing. SAMOSA-Tag of 30,000-50,000 nuclei resolved single-fiber chromatin structure, CTCF binding and DNA methylation in patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts and uncovered metastasis-associated global epigenome disorganization. Tagmentation thus promises to enable sensitive, scalable and multimodal single-molecule genomics for diverse basic and clinical applications."
38723624,Chemoradiotherapy-induced ACKR2(+) tumor cells drive CD8(+) T cell senescence and cervical cancer recurrence.,"Tumor recurrence after chemoradiotherapy is challenging to overcome, and approaches to predict the recurrence remain elusive. Here, human cervical cancer tissues before and after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing reveal that CCRT specifically promotes CD8(+) T cell senescence, driven by atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2)(+) CCRT-resistant tumor cells. Mechanistically, ACKR2 expression is increased in response to CCRT and is also upregulated through the ligation of CC chemokines that are produced by activated myeloid and T cells. Subsequently, ACKR2(+) tumor cells are induced to produce transforming growth factor beta to drive CD8(+) T cell senescence, thereby compromising antitumor immunity. Moreover, retrospective analysis reveals that ACKR2 expression and CD8(+) T cell senescence are enhanced in patients with cervical cancer who experienced recurrence after CCRT, indicating poor prognosis. Overall, we identify a subpopulation of CCRT-resistant ACKR2(+) tumor cells driving CD8(+) T cell senescence and tumor recurrence and highlight the prognostic value of ACKR2 and CD8(+) T cell senescence for chemoradiotherapy recurrence."
38723038,CRISPR-Cas9 genome and long non-coding RNAs as a novel diagnostic index for prostate cancer therapy via liposomal-coated compounds.,"CRISPR/Cas9 is a recently discovered genomic editing technique that altered scientist's sight in studying genes function. Cas9 is controlled via guide (g) RNAs, which match the DNA targeted in cleavage to modify the respective gene. The development in prostate cancer (PC) modeling directed not only to novel resources for recognizing the signaling pathways overriding prostate cell carcinoma, but it has also created a vast reservoir for complementary tools to examine therapies counteracting this type of cancer. Various cultured somatic rat models for prostate cancer have been developed that nearly mimic human prostate cancer. Nano-medicine can passively target cancer cells via increasing bioavailability and conjugation via specific legend, contributing to reduced systemic side-effects and increased efficacy. This article highlights liposomal loaded Nano-medicine as a potential treatment for prostate cancer and clarifies the CRISPR/Cas9 variation accompanied with prostate cancer. PC is induced experimentally in western rat model via ethinyl estradiol for 4 weeks and SC. dose of 3, 2'- dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl estradiol (DAE) (50mg/kg) followed by treatment via targeted liposomal-coated compounds such as liposomal dexamethasone (DXM), liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) and liposomal Turmeric (TUR) (3mg/kg IP) for four weeks in a comparative study to their non-targeted analogue dexamethasone, doxorubicin and Turmeric. 3, 2'- dimethyl-4-aminobiphenylestradiol elicit prostate cancer in western rats within 5 months. Simultaneous supplementations with these liposomal compounds influence on prostate cancer; tumor markers were investigated via prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Nitric oxide (NOX) and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Several long non-coding RNAs were reported to be deregulated in prostate cell carcinoma, including MALAT1. On the other hand, gene expression of apoptotic biomarkers focal adhesion kinase (AKT-1), phosphatidylinistol kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) was also investigated and further confirming these results via histopathological examination. Liposomal loaded dexamethasone; doxorubicin and Turmeric can be considered as promising therapeutic agents for prostate cancer via modulating CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and long non coding gene MALAT1."
38722704,From Androgen Dependence to Independence in Prostate Cancer: Unraveling Therapeutic Potential and Proteomic Landscape of Hydroxychloroquine as an Autophagy Inhibitor.,"Prostate cancer is a major planetary health challenge wherein new ways of thinking drug discovery and therapeutics innovation are much needed. Numerous studies have shown that autophagy inhibition holds a significant role as an adjunctive intervention in prostate cancer. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has gained considerable attention due to its established role as an autophagy inhibitor across diverse cancer types, but its proteomics landscape and systems biology in prostate cancer are currently lacking in the literature. This study reports the proteomic responses to HCQ in prostate cancer cells, namely, androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC3 cells. Differentially expressed proteins and proteome in HCQ-treated cells were determined by label-free quantification with nano-high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (nHPLC-MS/MS), and harnessing bioinformatics tools. In PC3 cells, there was a marked shift toward metabolic reprogramming, highlighted by an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins in oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle, suggesting an adaptive mechanism to maintain energy production under therapeutic stress. In contrast, LNCaP cells prioritized proteostasis and cell cycle regulation, indicating a more conservative adaptation strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the differential responses of prostate cancer cells to autophagy inhibition by HCQ, suggesting that a combination therapy approach, targeting distinct pathways in androgen-independent and androgen-dependent cells, could represent a promising treatment strategy. Moreover, the varied proteomic responses observed between these cell lines underscore the importance of personalized medicine in cancer therapy. Future translational and clinical research on HCQ and prostate cancer are called for."
38722048,Aberrant Super-Enhancer Landscape in Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Background: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which has developed resistance to next-generation antiandrogens, such as enzalutamide (Enz), is a lethal disease. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation by super enhancers (SEs) is crucial for the growth and spread of prostate cancer, as well as drug resistance. The functions of SEs, a significant class of noncoding DNA cis-regulatory elements, have been the subject of numerous recent studies in the field of cancer research. Materials and Methods: The goal of this research was to identify SEs associated with Enz resistance in C4-2B cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag). Using HOMER analysis to predict protein/gene-binding motifs, we identified master transcription factors (TFs) that may bind to SE sites. Using small interfering RNA, WST-1 assays, and qRT-PCR, we then confirmed the associations between TFs of SEs and Enz resistance. Results: A total of 999 SEs were screened from C4-2B EnzR cells in total. Incorporating analysis with RNA-seq data revealed 41 SEs to be strongly associated with the promotion of Enz resistance. In addition, we finally predicted that master TFs bind to SE-binding regions. Subsequently, we selected zinc finger protein 467 (ZFP467) and SMAD family member 3 to confirm the functional connections of master TFs with Enz resistance through SEs (ZNF467). Conclusions: In this study, SMAD3 and ZNF467 were found to be closely related to Enz-resistant CRPC. Our research uncovered a sizable group of SEs linked to Enz resistance in prostate cancer, dissected the mechanisms underlying SE Enz resistance, and shed light on potential clinical uses for SEs."
38721925,Cutibacterium acnes invades prostate epithelial cells to induce BRCAness as a possible pathogen of prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Abundant evidence suggests that chronic inflammation is linked to prostate cancer and that infection is a possible cause of prostate cancer. METHODS: To identify microbiota or pathogens associated with prostate cancer, we investigated the transcriptomes of 20 human prostate cancer tissues. We performed de novo assembly of nonhuman sequences from RNA-seq data. RESULTS: We identified four bacteria as candidate microbiota in the prostate, including Moraxella osloensis, Uncultured chroococcidiopsis, Cutibacterium acnes, and Micrococcus luteus. Among these, C. acnes was detected in 19 of 20 prostate cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. We then analyzed the gene expression profiles of prostate epithelial cells infected in vitro with C. acnes and found significant changes in homologous recombination (HR) and the Fanconi anemia pathway. Notably, electron microscopy demonstrated that C. acnes invaded prostate epithelial cells and localized in perinuclear vesicles, whereas analysis of gammaH2AX foci and HR assays demonstrated impaired HR repair. In particular, BRCA2 was significantly downregulated in C. acnes-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that C. acnes infection in the prostate could lead to HR deficiency (BRCAness) which promotes DNA double-strand breaks, thereby increasing the risk of cancer development."
38721894,Multiomics sequencing and immune microenvironment characteristics define three subtypes of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix.,"Small cell cervical carcinoma (SCCC) is the most common neuroendocrine tumor in the female genital tract, with an unfavorable prognosis and lacking an evidence-based therapeutic approach. Until now, the distinct subtypes and immune characteristics of SCCC combined with genome and transcriptome have not been described. We performed genomic (n = 18), HPV integration (n = 18), and transcriptomic sequencing (n = 19) of SCCC samples. We assessed differences in immune characteristics between SCCC and conventional cervical cancer, and other small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, through bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemical assays. We stratified SCCC patients through non-negative matrix factorization and described the characteristics of these distinct types. We further validated it using multiplex immunofluorescence (n = 77) and investigated its clinical prognostic effect. We confirmed a high frequency of PIK3CA and TP53 alterations and HPV18 integrations in SCCC. SCCC and other small cell carcinoma had similar expression signatures and immune cell infiltration patterns. Comparing patients with SCCC to those with conventional cervical cancer, the former presented immune excluded or 'desert' infiltration. The number of CD8+ cells in the invasion margin of SCCC patients predicted favorable clinical outcomes. We identified three transcriptome subtypes: an inflamed phenotype with high-level expression of genes related to the MHC-II complex (CD74) and IFN-alpha/beta (SCCC-I), and two neuroendocrine subtypes with high-level expression of ASCL1 or NEUROD1, respectively. Combined with multiple technologies, we found that the neuroendocrine groups had more TP53 mutations and SCCC-I had more PIK3CA mutations. Multiplex immunofluorescence validated these subtypes and SCCC-I was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival. These results provide insights into SCCC tumor heterogeneity and potential therapies. (c) 2024 The Authors.

38720416,Synergistic cytotoxicity and in vitro antioxidant activity of hederagenin and its glycoside from quinoa.,"Although a series of studies confirm the bioactivities of hederagenin and its glycosides, their synergistic effects and potential mechanisms are still worthy of further exploration. This work investigated the synergistic cytotoxicity and in vitro antioxidant activity of hederagenin and hederagenin 28-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (28-Glc-hederagenin). Hederagenin and 28-Glc-hederagenin inhibited HeLa cell growth and their combination further strengthened this effect. The combination of hederagenin and 28-Glc-hederagenin significantly increased the rate of apoptotic cells, suggesting the presence of a synergistic effect between the two substances. This combination also enhanced in vitro antioxidant activity compared with individual treatments. A network pharmacology and molecular docking-based approach was performed to explore the underlying mechanisms of hederagenin and 28-Glc-hederagenin against cervical cancer and oxidant damage. This work identified 18 related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways, 202 related biological process terms, 17 related CC terms, and 35 related molecular function terms and then revealed 30 nodes and 196 edges. Subsequently, two highly connected clusters and the top four targets were identified. Molecular docking showed potent binding affinity of hederagenin and 28-Glc-hederagenin toward core targets associated with both cervical cancer and oxidant damage. This work may provide scientific basis for the combined use of hederagenin and its glycosides as dietary supplements."
38719469,Estrogen receptor 1 chromatin profiling in human breast tumors reveals high inter-patient heterogeneity with enrichment of risk SNPs and enhancer activity at most-conserved regions.,"Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1; also known as ERalpha, encoded by ESR1 gene) is the main driver and prime drug target in luminal breast cancer. ESR1 chromatin binding is extensively studied in cell lines and a limited number of human tumors, using consensi of peaks shared among samples. However, little is known about inter-tumor heterogeneity of ESR1 chromatin action, along with its biological implications. Here, we use a large set of ESR1 ChIP-seq data from 70 ESR1(+) breast cancers to explore inter-patient heterogeneity in ESR1 DNA binding to reveal a striking inter-tumor heterogeneity of ESR1 action. Of note, commonly shared ESR1 sites show the highest estrogen-driven enhancer activity and are most engaged in long-range chromatin interactions. In addition, the most commonly shared ESR1-occupied enhancers are enriched for breast cancer risk SNP loci. We experimentally confirm SNVs to impact chromatin binding potential for ESR1 and its pioneer factor FOXA1. Finally, in the TCGA breast cancer cohort, we can confirm these variations to associate with differences in expression for the target gene. Cumulatively, we reveal a natural hierarchy of ESR1-chromatin interactions in breast cancers within a highly heterogeneous inter-tumor ESR1 landscape, with the most common shared regions being most active and affected by germline functional risk SNPs for breast cancer development."
38716512,Assessment of urine sample collection and processing variables for extracellular vesicle-based proteomics.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) in urine are a promising source for developing non-invasive biomarkers. However, urine concentration and content are highly variable and dynamic, and actual urine collection and handling often is nonideal. Furthermore, patients such as those with prostate diseases have challenges in sample collection due to difficulties in holding urine at designated time points. Here, we simulated the actual situation of clinical sample collection to examine the stability of EVs in urine under different circumstances, including urine collection time and temporary storage temperature, as well as daily urine sampling under different diet conditions. EVs were isolated using functionalized EVtrap magnetic beads and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), western blotting, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS). EVs in urine remained relatively stable during temporary storage for 6 hours at room temperature and for 12 hours at 4  degrees C, while significant fluctuations were observed in EV amounts from urine samples collected at different time points from the same individuals, especially under certain diets. Sample normalization with creatinine reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) values among EV samples from 17% to approximately 6% and facilitated downstream MS analyses. Finally, based on the results, we applied them to evaluate potential biomarker panels in prostate cancer by data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS, presenting the recommendation that can facilitate biomarker discovery with nonideal handling conditions."
38715205,Chimera RNA transcribed from integrated HPV18 genome with adjacent host genomic region promotes oncogenic gene expression through condensate formation.,"Most cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In HeLa cells, the HPV18 viral genome is integrated at chromosome 8q24.21 and activates transcription of the proto-oncogene c-Myc. However, the mechanism of how the integrated HPV genome and its transcribed RNAs exhibit transcription activation function has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that HPV18 transcripts contain an enhancer RNA-like function to activate proximal genes including CCAT1-5L and c-Myc. We showed that the human genome-integrated HPV18 genes are activated by transcription coregulators including BRD4 and Mediator. The transcribed HPV18 RNAs form a liquid-like condensate at chromosome 8q24.21 locus, which in turn accumulates RNA polymerase II. Moreover, we focused on a relatively uncharacterized transcript from the upstream region of CCAT1, named URC. The URC RNA is transcribed as a chimera RNA with HPV18 and is composed of the 3'-untranslated region of the HPV18 transcript. We experimentally showed that the URC contributes to stabilization of HPV18 RNAs by supplying a polyadenylation site for the HPV18 transcript. Our findings suggest that integrated HPV18 at 8q24.21 locus produces HPV18-URC chimera RNA and promotes tumorigenesis through RNA-based condensate formation."
38715121,UBE2N promotes cell viability and glycolysis by promoting Axin1 ubiquitination in prostate cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N) is recognized in the progression of some cancers; however, little research has been conducted to describe its role in prostate cancer. The purpose of this paper is to explore the function and mechanism of UBE2N in prostate cancer cells. METHODS: UBE2N expression was detected in Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) data, prostate cancer tissue microarrays, and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively. UBE2N knockdown or overexpression was used to analyze its role in cell viability and glycolysis of prostate cancer cells and tumor growth. XAV939 or Axin1 overexpression was co-treated with UBE2N overexpression to detect the involvement of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and Axin1 in the UBE2N function. UBE2N interacting with Axin1 was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: UBE2N was upregulated in prostate cancer and the UBE2N-high expression correlated with the poor prognosis of prostate cancer. UBE2N knockdown inhibited cell viability and glycolysis in prostate cancer cells and restricted tumor formation in tumor-bearing mice. Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition and Axin1 overexpression reversed the promoting viability and glycolysis function of UBE2N. UBE2N promoted Axin1 ubiquitination and decreased Axin1 protein level."
38712797,Reactivation of methylation-silenced PAX1 inhibits cervical cancer proliferation and migration via the WNT/TIMELESS pathway.,"Although aberrant methylation of PAX1 is closely associated with cervical cancer (CC), PAX1 methylation (PAX1m) and its role in CC remain to be elucidated. Here, we clarified the biological function of PAX1 in CC. First, PAX1m in ThinPrep cytologic test samples was measured via quantitative methylation-specific PCR. The results showed that PAX1 promoter methylation levels were significantly increased in CC patients (p < 0.001). We also found that PAX1 promoter methylation levels were positively correlated with tumor purity but negatively correlated with immune-infiltration via public databases. Then, CRISPR-based methylation perturbation tools (dCas9-Tet1) were constructed to further demonstrate that DNA methylation participates in the regulation of PAX1 expression directly. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were used to show that PAX1 overexpression restrained proliferation, migration and improved cisplatin sensitivity by interfering with the WNT/TIMELESS axis in CC cells. Additionally, Co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed the interaction between PAX1 and TCF7L2. Taken together, our results suggested that a tumor suppressor role of PAX1 in CC and that CRISPR-based PAX1 demethylation editing might be a promising therapeutic strategy for CC."
38712633,Liquid biomarkers in prostate cancer: recent advancements and future directions.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Traditional diagnostic approaches of prostate cancer like PSA are limited by high false-positive rates and insufficient capture of tumour heterogeneity, necessitating the development of more precise tools. This review examines the latest advancements in liquid biomarkers for prostate cancer, focusing on their potential to refine diagnostic accuracy and monitor disease progression. RECENT FINDINGS: Liquid biomarkers have gained prominence because of their minimally invasive nature and ability to reflect the molecular characteristics of prostate cancer. Circulating tumour cells provide insight into tumour cell dissemination and are indicative of aggressive disease phenotypes, with single-cell analyses revealing genomic instability and treatment resistance. Circulating tumour DNA offers real-time tumour genomic information, aiding in treatment decision-making in advanced prostate cancer, where it has been associated with clinical progression. MicroRNAs act as oncogenes or tumour suppressors and exhibit diagnostic and prognostic potential; however, their clinical utility is constrained by the lack of consistent validation. Extracellular vesicles contain tumour-derived biomolecules, with specific proteins demonstrating prognostic relevance. Applications of these markers to urinary testing have been demonstrated. SUMMARY: Liquid biomarkers show potential in refining prostate cancer management. Future research should aim to integrate these biomarkers into a cohesive framework in line with precision medicine principles."
38711861,"Unravelling genetic architecture of circulatory amino acid levels, and their effect on risk of complex disorders.","Variations in serum amino acid levels are linked to a multitude of complex disorders. We report the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on nine serum amino acids in the UK Biobank participants (117 944, European descent). We identified 34 genomic loci for circulatory levels of alanine, 48 loci for glutamine, 44 loci for glycine, 16 loci for histidine, 11 loci for isoleucine, 19 loci for leucine, 9 loci for phenylalanine, 32 loci for tyrosine and 20 loci for valine. Our gene-based analysis mapped 46-293 genes associated with serum amino acids, including MIP, GLS2, SLC gene family, GCKR, LMO1, CPS1 and COBLL1.The gene-property analysis across 30 tissues highlighted enriched expression of the identified genes in liver tissues for all studied amino acids, except for isoleucine and valine, in muscle tissues for serum alanine and glycine, in adrenal gland tissues for serum isoleucine and leucine, and in pancreatic tissues for serum phenylalanine. Mendelian randomization (MR) phenome-wide association study analysis and subsequent two-sample MR analysis provided evidence that every standard deviation increase in valine is associated with 35% higher risk of type 2 diabetes and elevated levels of serum alanine and branched-chain amino acids with higher levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein. In contrast to reports by observational studies, MR analysis did not support a causal association between studied amino acids and coronary artery disease, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer or prostate cancer. In conclusion, we explored the genetic architecture of serum amino acids and provided evidence supporting a causal role of amino acids in cardiometabolic health."
38709170,Tertiary lymphoid structures associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity and favorable prognosis in cervical squamous carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical squamous carcinoma (CESC) is the main subtype of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, there are presently no effective treatment options for advanced and recurrent CESC. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are clusters of lymphoid cells that resemble secondary lymphoid organs; nevertheless, there is no summary of the clinical importance of TLS in CESC. METHODS: A large set of transcriptomic and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were used to analyze the pattern of TLS and its immuno-correlations in CESC. Additionally, an independent in-house cohort was collected to validate the correlation between TLS and TME features. RESULTS: In the current study, we found that the presence of TLS could predict better prognosis in CESC and was correlated with the activation of immunological signaling pathways and enrichment of immune cell subpopulations. In addition, TLS was associated with reduced proliferation activity in tumor cells, indicating the negative correlation between TLS and the degree of malignancy. Last but not least, in two independent immunotherapy cohorts, tumors with the presence of TLS were more sensitive to immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: Overall, TLS is related to an inflamed TME and identified immune-hot tumors, which could be an indicator for the identification of immunological features in CESC."
38709075,Pan-Cancer Interrogation of B7-H3 (CD276) as an Actionable Therapeutic Target Across Human Malignancies.,"B7-H3 (CD276) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the B7 immune checkpoint superfamily that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. To better understand the applicability of B7-H3-directed therapies, we analyzed 156,791 samples comprising 50 cancer types to interrogate the clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and immunologic correlates of B7-H3 mRNA expression. DNA (592-gene/whole-exome) and RNA (whole-transcriptome) sequencing was performed from samples submitted to Caris Life Sciences. B7-H3 high versus low expression was based on top and bottom quartiles for each cancer type. Patients' overall survival was determined from insurance claims data. Pathway analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analyses. Immune cell fractions were inferred using quanTIseq. B7-H3 is expressed across several human malignancies including prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancers. High B7-H3 expression is associated with differences in overall survival, possibly indicating a prognostic role of B7-H3 for some cancers. When examining molecular features across all cancer types, we did not identify recurrent associations between B7-H3 expression and genetic alterations in TP53, RB1, and KRAS. However, we find consistent enrichment of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, Wnt, TGFbeta, and Notch signaling pathways. In addition, tumors with high B7-H3 expression are associated with greater proportions of M1 macrophages, but lower fractions of CD8+ T cells. We have begun to define the genomic, transcriptomic, clinical, and immunologic features associated with B7-H3 expression in 50 cancer types. We report novel clinical and molecular features of B7-H3-high tumors which may inform how current B7-H3 therapeutics should be deployed and prioritized. SIGNIFICANCE: B7-H3-targeting therapeutics have shown promising results in initial clinical trials. In this pan-cancer analysis of B7-H3 mRNA expression, we found that B7-H3 exhibits robust expression in many common cancer types. These results may inform further development of B7-H3-targeting therapeutics and may guide clinical decisions for patients with limited treatment options."
38708811,Changes in intrahost genetic diversity according to lesion severity in longitudinal HPV16 samples.,"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is the most common cause of cervical cancer, but most infections are transient with lesions not progressing to cancer. There is a lack of specific biomarkers for early cancer risk stratification. This study aimed to explore the intrahost HPV16 genomic variation in longitudinal samples from HPV16-infected women with different cervical lesion severity (normal, low-grade, and high-grade). The TaME-seq deep sequencing protocol was used to generate whole genome HPV16 sequences of 102 samples collected over time from 40 individuals. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and intrahost SNVs (iSNVs) were identified in the viral genomes. A majority of individuals had a unique set of SNVs and these SNVs were stable over time. Overall, the number of iSNVs and APOBEC3-induced iSNVs were significantly lower in high-grade relative to normal and low-grade samples. A significant increase in the number of APOBEC3-induced iSNVs over time was observed for normal samples when compared to high-grade. Our results indicates that the lower incidence of iSNVs and APOBEC3-induced iSNVs in high-grade lesions may have implications for novel biomarkers discoveries, potentially aiding early stratification of HPV-induced cervical precancerous lesions."
38706896,Mendelian randomization combined with multi-omics explores the relationship between heart failure and cancer.,"Background: Whether there is an association between HF (HF) and cancer has not been conclusively established, and it is not clear whether patients with cancer can share similar hospitalization strategies and outcomes with patients with HF. Methods: Genome-wide association summary statistics were performed using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method for HF patients and cancer patients from the GWAS directory, with co-localization and Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analyses to identify HF-associated genes, and transcriptomic analyses to analyze the roles of these genes in the clinical diagnosis and targeted therapies of multiple cancer types. Results: Two-sample MR analysis showed that increased risk of HF was associated with decreased risk of cervical, brain, breast, colorectal, lung, and skin cancers, and co-localization combined with SMR analysis identified ABO and SURF1 as HF-associated genes, and transcriptomic analyses showed that ABO is a risk factor for HF and a protective factor against cancer, whereas SURF1 is a protective factor against HF and a protective factor against cancer. Conclusion: There was no causal relationship between heart failure and cancers (Cervical, brain, breast, colorectal, lung and skin cancers) risk factors, however there was a trend toward a negative causal relationship between heart failure and cancers (Cervical, brain, breast, colorectal, lung and skin cancers) occurrence."
38704603,Loss of heterozygosity impacts MHC expression on the immune microenvironment in CDK12-mutated prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: In prostate cancer (PCa), well-established biomarkers such as MSI status, TMB high, and PDL1 expression serve as reliable indicators for favorable responses to immunotherapy. Recent studies have suggested a potential association between CDK12 mutations and immunotherapy response; however, the precise mechanisms through which CDK12 mutation may influence immune response remain unclear. A plausible explanation for immune evasion in this subset of CDK12-mutated PCa may be reduced MHC expression. RESULTS: Using genomic data of CDK12-mutated PCa from 48 primary and 10 metastatic public domain samples and a retrospective cohort of 53 low-intermediate risk primary PCa, we investigated how variation in the expression of the MHC genes affected associated downstream pathways. We classified the patients based on gene expression quartiles of MHC-related genes and categorized the tumors into ""High"" and ""Low"" expression levels. CDK12-mutated tumors with higher MHC-expressed pathways were associated with the immune system and elevated PD-L1, IDO1, and TIM3 expression. Consistent with an inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) phenotype, digital cytometric analyses identified increased CD8 + T cells, B cells, gammadelta T cells, and M1 Macrophages in this group. In contrast, CDK12-mutated tumors with lower MHC expression exhibited features consistent with an immune cold TME phenotype and immunoediting. Significantly, low MHC expression was also associated with chromosome 6 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting the entire HLA gene cluster. These LOH events were observed in both major clonal and minor subclonal populations of tumor cells. In our retrospective study of 53 primary PCa cases from this Institute, we found a 4% (2/53) prevalence of CDK12 mutations, with the confirmation of this defect in one tumor through Sanger sequencing. In keeping with our analysis of public domain data this tumor exhibited low MHC expression at the RNA level. More extensive studies will be required to determine whether reduced HLA expression is generally associated with primary tumors or is a specific feature of CDK12 mutated PCa. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that analysis of CDK12 alteration, in the context of MHC expression levels, and LOH status may offer improved predictive value for outcomes in this potentially actionable genomic subgroup of PCa. In addition, these findings highlight the need to explore novel therapeutic strategies to enhance MHC expression in CDK12-defective PCa to improve immunotherapy responses."
38704080,Characterization of the dehydrogenase-reductase DHRS2 and its involvement in histone deacetylase inhibition in urological malignancies.,"BACKGROUND: Being implicated during tumor migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and proliferation, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/-phosphate (NADP)-dependent dehydrogenase/reductase member 2 (DHRS2) has been considered to be induced upon inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACi). In this study, we evaluated the current knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of the (epi)genetic regulation of DHRS2, as well as its function during tumor progression. METHODS: DHRS2 expression was evaluated on mRNA- and protein-level upon treatment with HDACi by means of qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Re-analysis of RNA-sequencing data gained insight into expression of specific DHRS2 isoforms, while re-analysis of ATAC-sequencing data shed light on the chromatin accessibility at the DHRS2 locus. Further examination of the energy and lipid metabolism of HDACi-treated urologic tumor cells was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Enhanced DHRS2 expression levels upon HDACi treatment were directly linked to an enhanced chromatin accessibility at the DHRS2 locus. Particularly the DHRS2 ENST00000250383.11 protein-coding isoform was increased upon HDACi treatment. Application of the HDACi quisinostat only mildly influenced the energy metabolism of urologic tumor cells, though, the analysis of the lipid metabolism showed diminished sphingosine levels, as well as decreased S1P levels. Also the ratios of S1P/sphingosine and S1P/ceramides were reduced in all four quisinostat-treated urologic tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: With the emphasis on urologic malignancies (testicular germ cell tumors, urothelial, prostate, and renal cell carcinoma), this study concluded that elevated DHRS2 levels are indicative of a successful HDACi treatment and, thereby offering a novel putative predictive biomarker."
38703335,The cuproptosis-related gene UBE2D2 functions as an immunotherapeutic and prognostic biomarker in pan-cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis, as a unique modality of regulated cell death, requires the involvement of ubiquitin-binding enzyme UBE2D2. However, the prognostic and immunotherapeutic values of UBE2D2 in pan-cancer remain largely unknown. METHODS: Using UCSC Xena, TIMER, Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases, we aimed to explore the differential expression pattern of UBE2D2 across multiple cancer types and to evaluate its association with patient prognosis, clinical features, and genetic variations. The association between UBE2D2 and immunotherapy response was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis, tumor microenvironment, immune gene co-expression and drug half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) analysis. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of UBE2D2 were markedly elevated in most cancer types, and UBE2D2 exhibited prognostic significance in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), kidney chromophobe (KICH), uveal melanomas (UVM), cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). UBE2D2 expression was correlated with clinical features, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and anti-tumor drug resistance in several tumor types. Gene enrichment analysis showed that UBE2D2 was significantly associated with immune-related pathways. The expression level of UBE2D2 was correlated with immune cell infiltration, including CD4 + T cells、Macrophages M2、CD8 + T cells in pan-cancer. PDCD1, CD274 and CTLA4 expression levels were positively correlated with UBE2D2 level in multiple cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We comprehensively investigated the potential value of UBE2D2 as a prognostic and immunotherapeutic predictor for pan-cancer, providing a novel insight for cancer immunotherapy."
38703296,Revealing the Causal Impact of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Cancer Risk: Insights from Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have a potential carcinogenic role. However, the results of these studies were inconsistent and the underlying genetic mechanisms have yet to be fully understood. METHODS: We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using large-scale genome-wide association studies summary statistics to explore the possible causal effect of OSA on the risk of 16 specific-site cancers in the European population. RESULTS: The MR analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between OSA and the susceptibility to prostate cancer (OR: 0.87, 95%CI 0.79-0.95, p = 0.002) and a causal increase in the vulnerability to pancreatic malignancies (OR: 2.02, 95%CI 1.1-3.7, p = 0.02). However, no causal effects of OSA on other specific-site cancers were found. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy, thus validating the robustness of the original results. CONCLUSION: Our MR provided important insights into the causal associations between OSA and cancer risk, highlighting both protective and potentially harmful effects of OSA on different cancer types."
38699639,Nanocage-incorporated engineered destabilized 3'UTR ARE of ERBB2 inhibits tumor growth and liver and lung metastasis in EGFR T790M osimertinib- and trastuzumab-resistant and ERBB2-expressing NSCLC via the reduction of ERBB2.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) caused more deaths in 2017 than breast cancer, prostate, and brain cancers combined. This is primarily due to their aggressive metastatic nature, leading to more fatal rates of cancer patients. Despite this condition, there are no clinically approved drugs that can target metastasis. The NSCLC with EGFR T790M-overexpressing HER2 shows the resistance to osimertinib and trastuzumab starting 10-18 months after the therapy, and thus prospects are grim to these patients. To target the recalcitrant ERBB2 driver oncogene, we developed two engineered destabilizing 3'UTR ERBB2 constructs that degrade the endogenous ERBB2 transcript and proteins by overwriting the encoded endogenous ERBB2 mRNA with the destabilizing message. When iron oxide nanocages (IO nanocages) were used as vehicles to deliver them to tumors and whole tissues in mice bearing tumors, it was well tolerated and safe and caused no genome rearrangement whereas they were integrated into genome deserts (non-coding regions). We achieved significant reduction of the primary tumor volume with desARE3'UTRERBB2-30, achieving 50% complete tumor lysis and inhibiting 60%-80% of liver metastasis, hepatomegaly, and 90% of lung metastasis, through ERBB2 downregulation. These constructs were distributed robustly into tumors, livers, lungs, kidneys, and spleen and mildly in the brain and not in the heart. They caused no abnormality in both short- and long-term administrations as well as in healthy mice. In summary, we accomplished significant breakthrough for the therapeutics of intractable lung cancer patients whose cancers become resistant and metastasize."
38698844,MLXIPL associated with tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is involved in poor prostate cancer prognosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Within tumor microenvironment, the presence of preexisting antitumor CD8+ T Q7 cells have been shown to be associated with a favorable prognosis in most solid cancers. However, in the case of prostate cancer (PCa), they have been linked to a negative impact on prognosis. METHODS: To gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of infiltrating CD8+ T cells to poor prognosis in PCa, the infiltration levelsof CD8+ T cells were estimated using the TCGA PRAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma dataset) and MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) cohorts. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analyses revealed that CD8+ T cells likely influence PCa prognosis through increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules and enhanced recruitment of regulatory T cells. The MLXIPL was identified as the gene expressed in response to CD8+ T cell infiltration and was found to be associated with PCa prognosis. The prognostic role of MLXIPL was examined in two cohorts: TCGA PRAD (p = 2.3E-02) and the MSKCC cohort (p = 1.6E-02). Subsequently, MLXIPL was confirmed to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis in PCa, as evidenced by an independent cohort study (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.42- 4.65, p = 1.76E-03). DISCUSSION: In summary, the findings suggested that MLXIPL related to tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells facilitated a poor prognosis in PCa."
38698420,Single-sEV profiling identifies the TACSTD2 + sEV subpopulation as a factor of tumor susceptibility in the elderly.,"BACKGROUND: Aging is a very complex physiological phenomenon, and sEVs are involved in the regulation of this mechanism. Serum samples from healthy individuals under 30 and over 60 years of age were collected to analyze differences in sEVs proteomics. RESULTS: Based on PBA analysis, we found that sEVs from the serum of elderly individuals highly express TACSTD2 and identified a subpopulation marked by TACSTD2. Using ELISA, we verified the upregulation of TACSTD2 in serum from elderly human and aged mouse. In addition, we discovered that TACSTD2 was significantly increased in samples from tumor patients and had better diagnostic value than CEA. Specifically, 9 of the 13 tumor groups exhibited elevated TACSTD2, particularly for cervical cancer, colon cancer, esophageal carcinoma, liver cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, we found that serum sEVs from the elderly (especially those with high TACSTD2 levels) promoted tumor cell (SW480, HuCCT1 and HeLa) proliferation and migration. CONCLUSION: TACSTD2 was upregulated in the serum of elderly individuals and patients with tumors, and could serve as a dual biomarker for aging and tumors."
38698344,Patient-derived castration-resistant prostate cancer model revealed CTBP2 upregulation mediated by OCT1 and androgen receptor.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven effective in targeting prostate cancer. However, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges. AR signaling inhibitors (ARSI) have been also used, but resistance to these agents develops due to genetic AR alterations and epigenetic dysregulation. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the role of OCT1, a member of the OCT family, in an AR-positive CRPC patient-derived xenograft established from a patient with resistance to ARSI and chemotherapy. We conducted a genome-wide analysis chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analyses using public database. RESULTS: Genome-wide analysis of OCT1 target genes in PDX 201.1 A revealed distinct OCT1 binding sites compared to treatment-naive cells. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that OCT1-regulated genes were associated with cell migration and immune system regulation. In particular, C-terminal Binding Protein 2 (CTBP2), an OCT1/AR target gene, was correlated with poor prognosis and immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. Metascape revealed that CTBP2 knockdown affects genes related to the immune response to bacteria. Furthermore, TISIDB analysis suggested the relationship between CTBP2 expression and immune cell infiltration in prostate cancer, suggesting that it may contribute to immune evasion in CRPC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the genome-wide network of OCT1 and AR in AR-positive CRPC and highlight the potential role of CTBP2 in immune response and tumor progression. Targeting CTBP2 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for aggressive AR-positive CRPC. Further validation will be required to explore novel therapeutic strategies for CRPC management."
38693454,Comparison of discovery rates and prognostic utility of [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and circulating tumor DNA in prostate cancer-a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand positron-emission tomography (PET) enable minimal-invasive prostate cancer (PCa) detection and survival prognostication. The present study aims to compare their tumor discovery abilities and prognostic values. METHODS: One hundred thirty men with confirmed PCa (70.5 +/- 8.0 years) who underwent [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (184.8 +/- 19.7 MBq) imaging and plasma sample collection (March 2019-August 2021) were included. Plasma-extracted cell-free DNA was subjected to whole-genome-based ctDNA analysis. PSMA-positive tumor lesions were delineated and their quantitative parameters extracted. ctDNA and PSMA PET/CT discovery rates were compared, and the prognostic value for overall survival (OS) was evaluated. RESULTS: PSMA PET discovery rates according to castration status and PSA ranges did differ significantly (P = 0.013, P < 0.001), while ctDNA discovery rates did not (P = 0.311, P = 0.123). ctDNA discovery rates differed between localized and metastatic disease (P = 0.013). Correlations between ctDNA concentrations and PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-TV) were significant in all (r = 0.42, P < 0.001) and castration-resistant (r = 0.65, P < 0.001), however not in hormone-sensitive patients (r = 0.15, P = 0.249). PSMA-TV and ctDNA levels were associated with survival outcomes in the Logrank (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001) and multivariate Cox regression analysis (P = 0.0023, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PSMA PET imaging outperforms ctDNA analysis in detecting prostate cancer across the whole spectrum of disease, while both modalities are independently highly prognostic for survival outcomes."
38689972,Comparative analysis of 10X Chromium vs. BD Rhapsody whole transcriptome single-cell sequencing technologies in complex human tissues.,"The development of single-cell omics tools has enabled scientists to study the tumor microenvironment (TME) in unprecedented detail. However, each of the different techniques may have its unique strengths and limitations. Here we directly compared two commercially available high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies - droplet-based 10X Chromium vs. microwell-based BD Rhapsody - using paired samples from patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing a radical prostatectomy. Although high technical consistency was observed in unraveling the whole transcriptome, the relative abundance of cell populations differed. Cells with low mRNA content such as T cells were underrepresented in the droplet-based system, at least partly due to lower RNA capture rates. In contrast, microwell-based scRNA-seq recovered less cells of epithelial origin. Moreover, we discovered platform-dependent variabilities in mRNA quantification and cell-type marker annotation. Overall, our study provides important information for selection of the appropriate scRNA-seq platform and for the interpretation of published results."
38688467,Gray matter volume in women with the BRCA mutation with and without ovarian removal: evidence for increased risk of late-life Alzheimer's disease or dementia.,"OBJECTIVE: Ovarian removal prior to spontaneous/natural menopause (SM) is associated with increased risk of late life dementias including Alzheimer's disease. This increased risk may be related to the sudden and early loss of endogenous estradiol. Women with breast cancer gene mutations (BRCAm) are counseled to undergo oophorectomy prior to SM to significantly reduce their risk of developing breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers. There is limited evidence of the neurological effects of ovarian removal prior to the age of SM showing women without the BRCAm had cortical thinning in medial temporal lobe structures. A second study in women with BRCAm and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) noted changes in cognition. METHODS: The present, cross-sectional study examined whole-brain differences in gray matter (GM) volume using high-resolution, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in women with BRCAm and intact ovaries (BRCA-preBSO [study cohort with BRCA mutation prior to oophorectomy]; n = 9) and after surgery with (BSO + estradiol-based therapy [ERT]; n = 10) and without (BSO; n = 10) postsurgical estradiol hormone therapy compared with age-matched women (age-matched controls; n = 10) with their ovaries. RESULTS: The BRCA-preBSO and BSO groups showed significantly lower GM volume in the left medial temporal and frontal lobe structures. BSO + ERT exhibited few areas of lower GM volume compared with age-matched controls. Novel to this study, we also observed that all three BRCAm groups exhibited significantly higher GM volume compared with age-matched controls, suggesting continued plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence, through lower GM volume, to support both the possibility that the BRCAm, alone, and early life BSO may play a role in increasing the risk for late-life dementia. At least for BRCAm with BSO, postsurgical ERT seems to ameliorate GM losses."
38686195,Unveiling the potential of SLURP1 protein as a biomarker for prostate cancer screening.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) develops slowly and lacks obvious symptoms in the early stage, which makes early screening and diagnosis difficult. Urine collection is simple and is an ideal source of biomarkers. In this study, we performed urinary proteomic studies in PCa patients to screen proteins and apply them to the non-invasive early diagnosis of PCa. METHOD: Urine samples from PCa patients, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and normal control group were collected. Mass spectrometry was used for proteomic analysis and screening target proteins. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to verify the results. Correlations with clinical indicators were explored, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the value of target proteins in PCa. RESULT: A total of 1065 proteins were identified. Urinary SLURP1 protein was significantly elevated in patients with PCa compared with normal controls and patients with BPH patients. Western blot and ELISA further verified the expression changes of SLURP1. The immunohistochemical staining results revealed a substantial increase in positive SLURP1 expression within PCa tumor tissue. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the expression level of urine SLURP1 protein and serum PSA. ROC curve analysis of the SLURP1 protein in the urine of both normal individuals and PCa patients is determined to be 0.853 (95% CI=0.754 to 0.954). CONCLUSION: The concentration of SLURP1 protein in urine of PCa patients is increased, which can serve as a biomarker for screening PCa."
38685107,Germline biallelic BRCA2 pathogenic variants and medulloblastoma: an international cohort study.,"Constitutional heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes coding for some components of the Fanconi anemia-BRCA signaling pathway, which repairs DNA interstrand crosslinks, represent risk factors for common cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer. A high cancer risk is also a main clinical feature in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare condition characterized by bone marrow failure, endocrine and physical abnormalities. The mainly recessive condition is caused by germline pathogenic variants in one of 21 FA-BRCA pathway genes. Among patients with FA, the highest cancer risks are observed in patients with biallelic pathogenic variants in BRCA2 or PALB2. These patients develop a range of embryonal tumors and leukemia during the first decade of life, however, little is known about specific clinical, genetic and pathologic features or toxicities. Here, we present genetic, clinical, pathological and treatment characteristics observed in an international cohort of eight patients with FA due to biallelic BRCA2 pathogenic variants and medulloblastoma (MB), an embryonal tumor of the cerebellum. Median age at MB diagnosis was 32.5 months (range 7-58 months). All patients with available data had sonic hedgehog-MB. Six patients received chemotherapy and one patient also received proton radiation treatment. No life-threatening toxicities were documented. Prognosis was poor and all patients died shortly after MB diagnosis (median survival time 4.5 months, range 0-21 months) due to MB or other neoplasms. In conclusion, MB in patients with biallelic BRCA2 pathogenic variants is a lethal disease. Future experimental treatments are necessary to help these patients."
38684171,"AEBP1 upregulation contributes to cervical cancer progression by facilitating cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.","BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1) has been demonstrated to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of numerous cancers. This study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of AEBP1 in the development of cervical cancer. METHODS: The expression of AEBP1 in cervical cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The function of AEBP1 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, colony formation, and transwell assay. The activation of related signaling pathway was determined by western blot. The bioinformatics analysis was performed by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. RESULTS: Higher protein expression of AEBP1 was observed in patients with cervical cancer. Overexpressed AEBP1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, the research manifested that AEBP1 activated the phosphorylation of STAT3. GO and KEGG analysis showed that genes positively related to AEBP1 were highly enriched in functions like epithelial cell proliferation, muscle cell migration, myoblast migration, smooth muscle tissue development, ECM-receptor interaction, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, and proteoglycans in cancer. While genes negatively related to AEBP1 were associated with immunity, including inflammatory response, external-stimulus response, neutrophil, granulocyte, and macrophage chemotaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that AEBP1 acts as an oncogened and might be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer."
38683200,A Modular Trial of Androgen Signaling Inhibitor Combinations Testing a Risk-Adapted Strategy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of risk-adapted combinations of androgen signaling inhibitors and inform disease classifiers for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a modular, randomized phase II trial, 192 men were treated with 8 weeks of abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide (AAPA; module 1) and then allocated to modules 2 or 3 based on satisfactory (>/=50% PSA decline from baseline and <5 circulating tumor cell/7.5 mL) versus unsatisfactory status. Men in the former were randomly assigned to continue AAPA alone (module 2A) or with ipilimumab (module 2B). Men in the latter group had carboplatin + cabazitaxel added to AAPA (module 3). Optional baseline biopsies were subjected to correlative studies. RESULTS: Median overall survival (from allocation) was 46.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 39.2-68.2], 41.4 (95% CI, 33.3-49.9), and 18.7 (95% CI, 14.3-26.3) months in modules 2A (n = 64), 2B (n = 64), and 3 (n = 59), respectively. Toxicities were within expectations. Of 192 eligible patients, 154 (80.2%) underwent pretreatment metastatic biopsies. The aggressive-variant prostate cancer molecular profile (defects in >/=2 of p53, RB1, and PTEN) was associated with unsatisfactory status. Exploratory analyses suggested that secreted phosphoprotein 1-positive and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2-positive macrophages, druggable myeloid cell markers, and germline pathogenic mutations were enriched in the unsatisfactory group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding ipilimumab to AAPA did not improve outcomes in men with androgen-responsive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Despite the addition of carboplatin + cabazitaxel, men in the unsatisfactory group had shortened survivals. Adaptive designs can enrich for biologically and clinically relevant disease subgroups to contribute to the development of marker-informed, risk-adapted therapy strategies in men with prostate cancer."
38681319,Detection of High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Genotypes Among HIV-Infected Women in Four States in Nigeria.,"Introduction The World Health Organization states that almost all cervical cancer cases are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses transmitted through sexual contact. Implementing effective surveillance and preventive measures would enable the prevention of most cervical cancer cases, especially in HIV-infected women. Every year, about 12,000 women in Nigeria are diagnosed, with almost 8,000 deaths. HPV cervical cancer testing capacity is low in Nigeria. Testing scale-up and sensitization efforts across health facilities, including cervical tissue sample collection, are needed to reduce the cases of cervical cancer. This study aimed to assess the genotype-specific prevalence of clinically relevant high-risk HPV among women living with HIV in Nigeria. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among adult HIV-infected women attending health facilities in four Nigerian states. From August to October 2022, cervical tissue was collected into PCR cell media, transported to the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, and assayed for HPV presence and genotype using the Cobas 6800 System (Roche Diagnostics). Statistical analysis was conducted with Stata 2. Results A total of 4423 cervical swab samples were tested. The ages of women ranged from 18 to 72 years (mean 36.61+/-8.61). In our study, we found that 16.3% of participants tested positive for HPV. Among the high-risk HPV genotypes detected, HPV16 was present in 1.44% of participants, HPV18 in 1.29%, and other high-risk HPV (OHR-HPV) in 11.35%. Additionally, co-infections were observed, with 0.98% of participants testing positive for both HPV16 and OHR-HPV, 1.12% for HPV18 and OHR-HPV, and 0.12% for HPV16, HPV18, and OHR-HPV concurrently. However, 7.4% of the total results were deemed invalid. Conclusion OHR-HPV is prevalent among HIV-infected women across the north and west geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Policies and interventions geared towards curtailing the incidence of cervical cancer are fervently solicited."
38677732,Comparison of Clinicopathological and Prognostic Characteristics Between Minimal Deviation Adenocarcinoma and Gastric-type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Minimal deviation adenocarcinoma (MDA) is an extremely well-differentiated variant of gastric-type endocervical adenocarcinoma (GEA). This study compared the clinicopathological and prognostic characteristics of MDA to those of GEA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine MDAs and 22 GEAs were included in this study. We reviewed electronic medical records and pathology slides to collect clinicopathological and prognostic information. RESULTS: GEA showed significantly higher stage at presentation, more frequent parametrial extension and lymphovascular space invasion, and recurrence than MDA. Patients with GEA had significantly lower survival rates than those with MDA. None of the cases with MDA exhibited singly dispersed or clustered tumor cells, diffuse stromal desmoplasia, severe nuclear pleomorphism, loss of nuclear polarity, or coarse chromatin, all of which were frequently observed in GEA. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were observed in the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes between MDA and GEA. Further investigations using a larger cohort are warranted to determine the clinical behavior and aggressiveness of MDA."
38676802,Patient-Derived Xenograft Models for Translational Prostate Cancer Research and Drug Development.,"Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a valuable preclinical research platform generated through transplantation of a patient's resected tumor into an immunodeficient or humanized mouse. PDXs serve as a high-fidelity avatar for both precision medicine and therapeutic testing against the cancer patient's disease state. While PDXs show mixed response to initial establishment, those that successfully engraft and can be sustained with serial passaging form a useful tool for basic and translational prostate cancer (PCa) research. While genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models and human cancer cell lines, and their xenografts, each play beneficial roles in discovery science and initial drug screening, PDX tumors are emerging as the gold standard approach for therapeutic proof-of-concept prior to entering clinical trial. PDXs are a powerful platform, with PCa PDXs shown to represent the original patient tumor cell population and architecture, histopathology, genomic and transcriptomic landscape, and heterogeneity. Furthermore, PDX response to anticancer drugs in mice has been closely correlated to the original patient's susceptibility to these treatments in the clinic. Several PDXs have been established and have undergone critical in-depth characterization at the cellular and molecular level across multiple PCa tumor subtypes representing both primary and metastatic patient tumors and their inherent levels of androgen responsiveness and/or treatment resistance, including androgen-sensitive, castration resistant, and neuroendocrine PCa. Multiple PDX networks and repositories have been generated for the collaborative and shared use of these vital translational cancer tools. Here we describe the creation of a PDX maintenance colony from an established well-characterized PDX, best practice for PDX maintenance in mice, and their subsequent application in preclinical drug testing. This chapter aims to serve as a go to resource for the preparation and adoption of PCa PDX models in the research laboratory and for their use as a valuable preclinical platform for translational research and therapeutic agent development."
38675711,Effects of Red Sorghum-Derived Deoxyanthocyanidins and Their O-beta-D-Glucosides on E-Cadherin Promoter Activity in PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Although much less common than anthocyanins, 3-Deoxyanthocyanidins (3-DAs) and their glucosides can be found in cereals such as red sorghum. It is speculated that their bioavailability is higher than that of anthocyanins. Thus far, little is known regarding the therapeutic effects of 3-DAs and their O-beta-D-glucosides on cancer, including prostate cancer. Thus, we evaluated their potential to decrease cell viability, to modulate the activity of transcription factors such as NFkappaB, CREB, and SOX, and to regulate the expression of the gene CDH1, encoding E-Cadherin. We found that 4',7-dihydroxyflavylium chloride (P7) and the natural apigeninidin can reduce cell viability, whereas 4',7-dihydroxyflavylium chloride (P7) and 4'-hydroxy-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxyflavylium chloride (P3) increase the activities of NFkB, CREB, and SOX transcription factors, leading to the upregulation of CDH1 promoter activity in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Thus, these compounds may contribute to the inhibition of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells and prevent the metastatic activity of more aggressive forms of androgen-resistant prostate cancer."
38673886,The Suppression of the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer through the Targeting of MYO6 Using MiR-145-5p.,"Aberrant expression of miR-145-5p has been observed in prostate cancer where is has been suggested to play a tumor suppressor role. In other cancers, miR-145-5p acts as an inhibitor of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key molecular process for tumor progression. However, the interaction between miR-145-5p and EMT remains to be elucidated in prostate cancer. In this paper the link between miR-145-5p and EMT in prostate cancer was investigated using a combination of in silico and in vitro analyses. miR-145-5p expression was significantly lower in prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal prostate cells. Bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA PRAD) data showed significant downregulation of miR-145-5p in prostate cancer, correlating with disease progression. Functional enrichment analysis significantly associated miR-145-5p and its target genes with EMT. MYO6, an EMT-associated gene, was identified and validated as a novel target of miR-145-5p in prostate cancer cells. In vitro manipulation of miR-145-5p levels significantly altered cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and expression of EMT-associated markers. Additional TCGA PRAD analysis suggested miR-145-5p tumor expression may be useful predictor of disease recurrence. In summary, this is the first study to report that miR-145-5p may inhibit EMT by targeting MYO6 in prostate cancer cells. The findings suggest miR-145-5p could be a useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer."
38672714,Role of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Cervical Cancer: Integrating Classical Perspectives with Recent Technological Advances.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression and contributing to poor prognosis. However, in cervical cancer (CC), their significance and involvement are relatively less studied than in other gynecological cancers such as ovarian and endometrial cancer. This review aims to provide an overview of TAMs, covering their origins and phenotypes and their impact on CC progression, along with major TAM-targeted therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, we advocate for the integration of cutting-edge research methodologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial RNA sequencing, to enable in-depth and comprehensive investigations into TAMs in CC, which would be beneficial in leading to more personalized and effective immunotherapy strategies for patients with CC."
38672263,Exploring MiR-484 Regulation by Polyalthia longifolia: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Cervical Cancer through Integrated Bioinformatics and an In Vitro Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: MiR-484, implicated in various carcinomas, holds promise as a prognostic marker, yet its relevance to cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. Our prior study demonstrated the Polyalthia longifolia downregulation of miR-484, inhibiting HeLa cells. This study investigates miR-484's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in CC through integrated bioinformatics and an in vitro analysis. METHODS: MiR-484 levels were analyzed across cancers, including CC, from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The limma R package identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high- and low-miR-484 CC cohorts. We assessed biological functions, tumor microenvironment (TME), immunotherapy, stemness, hypoxia, RNA methylation, and chemosensitivity differences. Prognostic genes relevant to miR-484 were identified through Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, and a prognostic model was captured via multivariate Cox regression. Single-cell RNA sequencing determined cell populations related to prognostic genes. qRT-PCR validated key genes, and the miR-484 effect on CC proliferation was assessed via an MTT assay. RESULTS: MiR-484 was upregulated in most tumors, including CC, with DEGs enriched in skin development, PI3K signaling, and immune processes. High miR-484 expression correlated with specific immune cell infiltration, hypoxia, and drug sensitivity. Prognostic genes identified were predominantly epidermal and stratified patients with CC into risk groups, with the low-risk group showing enhanced survival and immunotherapeutic responses. qRT-PCR confirmed FGFR3 upregulation in CC cells, and an miR-484 mimic reversed the P. longifolia inhibitory effect on HeLa proliferation. CONCLUSION: MiR-484 plays a crucial role in the CC progression and prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for targeted therapy."
38671281,From biology to the clinic - exploring liver metastasis in prostate cancer.,"Liver metastases from prostate cancer are associated with an aggressive disease course and poor prognosis. Results from autopsy studies indicate a liver metastasis prevalence of up to 25% in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Population data estimate that ~3-10% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer harbour liver metastases at the baseline, rising to 20-30% in post-treatment cohorts, suggesting that selective pressure imposed by novel therapies might promote metastatic spread to the liver. Liver metastases are associated with more aggressive tumour biology than lung metastases. Molecular profiling of liver lesions showed an enrichment of low androgen receptor, neuroendocrine phenotypes and high genomic instability. Despite advancements in molecular imaging modalities such as prostate-specific membrane antigen PET-CT, and liquid biopsy markers such as circulating tumour DNA, early detection of liver metastases from prostate cancer remains challenging, as both approaches are hampered by false positive and false negative results, impeding the accurate identification of early liver lesions. Current therapeutic strategies showed limited efficacy in this patient population. Emerging targeted radionuclide therapies, metastasis-directed therapy, and novel systemic agents have shown preliminary activity against liver metastases, but require further validation. Treatment with various novel prostate cancer therapies might lead to an increase in the prevalence of liver metastasis, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated efforts across preclinical and clinical researchers to improve characterization, monitoring, and management of liver metastases from prostate cancer. Elucidating molecular drivers of liver tropism and interactions with the liver microenvironment might ultimately help to identify actionable targets to enhance survival in this high-risk patient group."
38670588,Genomic Frequencies of Dynamic DNA Sequences and Mammalian Lifespan.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Dynamic DNA sequences (i.e. sequences capable of forming hairpins, G-quadruplexes, i-motifs, and triple helices) can cause replication stress and associated mutations. One example of such a sequence occurs in the RACK7 gene in human DNA. Since this sequence forms i-motif structures at neutral pH that cause replication stress and result in spontaneous deletions in prostate cancer cells, our initial aim was to determine its potential utility as a biomarker of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We cloned and sequenced the region in RACK7 where i-motif deletions often occur in DNA obtained from eight individuals. Expressed prostatic secretions were obtained from three individuals with a positive biopsy for prostate cancer and two with individuals with a negative biopsy for prostate cancer. Peripheral blood specimens were obtained from two control healthy bone marrow donors and a marrow specimen was obtained from a third healthy marrow donor. Follow-up computer searches of the genomes of 74 mammalian species available at the NCBI ftp site or frequencies of 6 dynamic sequences known to produce mutations or replication stress using a program written in Mathematica were subsequently performed. RESULTS: Deletions were found in RACK7 in specimens from both older normal adults, as well as specimens from older patients with cancer, but not in the youngest normal adult. The deletions appeared to show a weak trend to increasing frequency with patient age. This suggested that endogenous mutations associated with dynamic sequences might accumulate during aging and might serve as biomarkers of biological age rather than direct biomarkers of cancer. To test that hypothesis, we asked whether or not the genomic frequencies of several dynamic sequences known to produce replication stress or mutations in human DNA were inversely correlated with maximum lifespan in mammals. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm this correlation for six dynamic sequences in 74 mammalian genomes studied, thereby suggesting that spontaneously induced replication stress and mutations linked to dynamic sequence frequency may limit lifespan by limiting genome stability."
38669077,Cell-Free Human Papillomavirus DNA Is a Sensitive Biomarker for Prognosis and for Early Detection of Relapse in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of the majority of cervical cancer cases and has been showed to be released as cell-free tumor DNA (ctHPV DNA) into the circulation. Here, we analyze if ctHPV DNA could be used as a prognostic biomarker and/or to detect relapse earlier than traditional methods in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 74 patients with LACC were included; 66of 74 were positive for 13 high-risk HPV types on a bead-based assay of tumor biopsy samples. HPV-type-specific droplet digital PCR assays were developed. Longitudinal plasma samples were then analyzed for the biopsy-verified HPV type for each patient. In total, 418 plasma samples were analyzed. Patients were followed for a median of 37 months. Results were correlated to tumor and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the pretreatment plasma samples, 92.4% were positive for ctHPV DNA. Persistent ctHPV DNA in end-of-treatment, early follow-up (1-2 months after end-of-treatment), or tumor evaluation (3-4 months after end-of-treatment) plasma was correlated with worse progression-free survival (P < 0.001) compared with if ctHPV DNA was not found. The positive predictive value of ctHPV status at early follow-up for predicting disease progression was 87.5%, and the negative predictive value was 89.3%. ctHPV DNA was found in plasma before relapse was diagnosed using radiology in all patients (n = 10) who experienced relapse after complete clinical response to treatment with a median 315 days lead time. CONCLUSIONS: ctHPV DNA in follow-up plasma is a promising prognostic biomarker in patients with LACC, useful for analysis of response to therapy and for early detection of relapse."
38667315,Probing the Effects of Retinoblastoma Binding Protein 6 (RBBP6) Knockdown on the Sensitivity of Cisplatin in Cervical Cancer Cells.,"Cervical cancer is a major cause of death in women despite the advancement of current treatment modalities. The conventional therapeutic agent, cisplatin (CCDP), is the standard treatment for CC; however, resistance often develops due to the cancer's heterogeneity. Therefore, a detailed elucidation of the specific molecular mechanisms driving CC is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Retinoblastoma binding protein 6 (RBBP6) is a potential biomarker associated with cell proliferation and is upregulated in cervical cancer sites, exhibiting apoptosis and dysregulated p53 expression. Furthermore, RBBP6 has been demonstrated to sensitize cancer cells to radiation and certain chemotherapeutic agents by regulating the Bcl-2 gene, thus suggesting a crosstalk among RBBP6/p53/BCL-2 oncogenic signatures. The present study, therefore, investigated the relationship between cisplatin and RBBP6 expression in CC cells. Herein, we first explored bioinformatics simulations and identified that the RBBP6/p53/BCL-2 signaling pathway is overexpressed and correlated with CC. For further analysis, we explored the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and found that most of the CC cell lines are sensitive to CCDP. To validate these findings, RBBP6 was silenced in HeLa and Vero cells using RNAi technology, followed by measurement of wild-type p53 and Bcl-2 at the mRNA level using qPCR. Cells co-treated with cisplatin and siRBBP6 were subsequently analyzed for apoptosis induction and real-time growth monitoring using flow cytometry and the xCELLigence system, respectively. Cancer cells in the co-treatment group showed a reduction in apoptosis compared to the cisplatin-treated group. Moreover, the real-time growth monitoring revealed a reduced growth rate in RBBP6 knockdown cells treated with cisplatin. Although wild-type p53 remained unchanged in the co-treatment group of cancer cells, Bcl-2 was completely repressed, suggesting that RBBP6 is necessary for sensitizing cervical cancer cells to cisplatin treatment by downregulating Bcl-2. The Vero cell population, which served as a non-cancerous control cell line in this study, remained viable following treatment with both siRBBP6 and cisplatin. Findings from this study suggest that RBBP6 expression promotes cisplatin sensitivity in HeLa cells through Bcl-2 downregulation. Knockdown of RBBP6 limits apoptosis induction and delays cell growth inhibition in response to cisplatin. The knowledge obtained here has the potential to help improve cisplatin efficacy through personalized administration based on the expression profile of RBBP6 among individual patients."
38666513,"Real-world utilization, patient characteristics, and treatment patterns among men with localized prostate cancer tested with the 17-gene genomic prostate score(R) (GPS(TM)) assay.","OBJECTIVES: Descriptive study focusing on real-world utilization and characteristics of men with prostate cancer tested with the 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score(R) (GPS) assay by linking administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data with GPS results. METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study (January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2020) included men aged 40-80 years with localized prostate cancer claims, continuous enrollment in Optum's Integrated Claims data set, >/=1 day of EHR clinical activity, and a GPS result. Men were classified as undergoing definitive therapy (DT) (prostatectomy, radiation, or focal therapy) or active surveillance (AS). AS and DT distribution were analyzed across GPS results, National Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) (NCCN(R)) risk, and race. Costs were assessed 6 months after the first GPS result (index); clinical outcomes and AS persistence were assessed during the variable follow-up. All variables were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Of 834 men, 650 (77.9%) underwent AS and 184 (22.1%) DT. Most men had Quan-Charlson comorbidity scores of 1-2 and a tumor stage of T1c (index). The most common Gleason patterns were 3 + 3 (79.6%) (AS cohort) and 3 + 4 (55.9%) (DT cohort). The mean (standard deviation) GPS results at index were 23.2 (11.3) (AS) and 30.9 (12.9) (DT). AS decreased with increasing GPS result and NCCN risk. Differences between races were minimal. Total costs were substantially higher in the DT cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Most men with GPS-tested localized prostate cancer underwent AS, indicating the GPS result can inform clinical management. Decreasing AS with increasing GPS result and NCCN risk suggests the GPS complements NCCN risk stratification."
38664014,Frequent Amplification and Overexpression of PSMA in Basallike Breast Cancer from Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas.,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is frequently overexpressed in nonprostate malignancies. This preclinical study investigated the molecular basis of the application of PMSA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in breast cancer subtypes. Methods: The somatic copy number status and the transcriptomic and protein expressions of FOLH1 (gene name of PSMA) were analyzed across breast cancer subtypes in 998 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Results: FOLH1 was frequently amplified in basallike breast cancer (BLBC) (32%) compared with luminal and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive subtypes (16% and 17%, respectively; P < 0.01). FOLH1 expression was higher in BLBC (P < 0.001) and was negatively correlated with estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor expressions. Consistently, the PSMA protein level was higher in BLBC (P < 0.05). Interestingly, FOLH1 expression was associated with relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival in patients with BLBC. Conclusion: The BLBC subtype exhibited frequent amplification and overexpression of PSMA, supporting the exploration of PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in this aggressive breast cancer subtype."
38663915,Comprehensive analysis of macrophage-related genes in prostate cancer by integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing.,"Macrophages, as essential components of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), could promote growth and invasion in many cancers. However, the role of macrophages in tumor microenvironment (TME) and immunotherapy in PCa is largely unexplored at present. Here, we investigated the roles of macrophage-related genes in molecular stratification, prognosis, TME, and immunotherapeutic response in PCa. Public databases provided single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNAseq data. Using the Seurat R package, scRNA-seq data was processed and macrophage clusters were identified automatically and manually. Using the CellChat R package, intercellular communication analysis revealed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) interact with other cells in the PCa TME primarily through MIF - (CD74+CXCR4) and MIF - (CD74+CD44) ligand-receptor pairs. We constructed coexpression networks of macrophages using the WGCNA to identify macrophage-related genes. Using the R package ConsensusClusterPlus, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identified two distinct macrophage-associated subtypes, which have significantly different pathway activation status, TIME, and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Next, an 8-gene macrophage-related risk signature (MRS) was established through the LASSO Cox regression analysis with 10-fold cross-validation, and the performance of the MRS was validated in eight external PCa cohorts. The high-risk group had more active immune-related functions, more infiltrating immune cells, higher HLA and immune checkpoint gene expression, higher immune scores, and lower TIDE scores. Finally, the NCF4 gene has been identified as the hub gene in MRS using the ""mgeneSim"" function."
38662984,Genomic Correlates of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression and Response to (177)Lu-PSMA-617: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study.,"PURPOSE: While (177)Lu-PSMA-617 (LuPSMA) is an effective therapy for many patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), biomarkers associated with outcomes are not well defined. We hypothesized that prostate cancer mutational profile may associate with clinical activity of LuPSMA. We devised a study to evaluate associations between mCRPC mutational profile with LuPSMA clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with mCRPC with next-generation sequencing (NGS) who received LuPSMA. PSA(50) response (ie, >/=50% decline in prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) rate, PSA progression free survival (PSA PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between genetically defined subgroups. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six patients with NGS results who received at least one cycle of LuPSMA were identified. The median age was 73 (IQR, 68-78) years, 124 (98.4%) received >/=1 prior androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor, and 121 (96%) received >/=1 taxane-based chemotherapy regimen. Fifty-eight (46%) patients with a DNA damage repair gene mutation (DNA damage response group) and 59 (46.8%) with a mutation in TP53, RB1, or PTEN tumor suppressor genes (TSG group) were identified. After adjusting for relevant confounders, the presence of >/=1 TSG mutation was associated with shorter PSA PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93 [95% CI, 1.05 to 3.54]; P = .034) and OS (HR, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.15 to 6.11]; P = .023). There was improved OS favoring the DNA damage response group (HR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.97]; P = .044) on multivariable analysis. Univariate analysis of patients with ATM mutations had significantly higher rates of PSA(50) response, PSA PFS, and OS. CONCLUSION: Outcomes on LuPSMA varied on the basis of mutational profile. Prospective studies to define the clinical activity of LuPSMA in predefined genomic subgroups are justified."
38661032,CDK9 inhibition activates innate immune response through viral mimicry.,"Cancer cells frequently exhibit hyperactivation of transcription, which can lead to increased sensitivity to compounds targeting the transcriptional kinases, in particular CDK9. However, mechanistic details of CDK9 inhibition-induced cancer cell-selective anti-proliferative effects remain largely unknown. Here, we discover that CDK9 inhibition activates the innate immune response through viral mimicry in cancer cells. In MYC over-expressing prostate cancer cells, CDK9 inhibition leads to the gross accumulation of mis-spliced RNA. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated kinase can recognize these mis-spliced RNAs, and we show that the activity of this kinase is required for the CDK9 inhibitor-induced anti-proliferative effects. Using time-resolved transcriptional profiling (SLAM-seq), targeted proteomics, and ChIP-seq, we show that, similar to viral infection, CDK9 inhibition significantly suppresses transcription of most genes but allows selective transcription and translation of cytokines related to the innate immune response. In particular, CDK9 inhibition activates NFkappaB-driven cytokine signaling at the transcriptional and secretome levels. The transcriptional signature induced by CDK9 inhibition identifies prostate cancers with a high level of genome instability. We propose that it is possible to induce similar effects in patients using CDK9 inhibition, which, we show, causes DNA damage in vitro. In the future, it is important to establish whether CDK9 inhibitors can potentiate the effects of immunotherapy against late-stage prostate cancer, a currently lethal disease."
38659923,DNA methylation differences between the female and male X chromosomes in human brain.,"The mechanisms of X chromosome inactivation suggest fundamental epigenetic differences between the female and male X chromosomes. However, DNA methylation studies often exclude the X chromosomes. In addition, many previous studies relied on techniques that examine non-randomly selected subsets of positions such as array-based methods, rather than assessing the whole X chromosome. Consequently, our understanding of X chromosome DNA methylation lags behind that of autosomes. Here we addressed this gap of knowledge by studying X chromosome DNA methylation using 89 whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) maps from neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using this unbiased and comprehensive data, we show that DNA methylation of the female X chromosomes is globally reduced (hypomethylated) across the entire chromosome compared to the male X chromosomes and autosomes. On the other hand, the majority of X-linked promoters were more highly methylated (hypermethylated) in females compared to males, consistent with the role of DNA methylation in X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation. Remarkably, hypermethylation of female X promoters was limited to a group of previously lowly methylated promoters. The other group of highly methylated promoters were both hyper- and hypo-methylated in females with no obvious association with gene expression. Therefore, X chromosome inactivation by DNA methylation was exclusive to a subset of promoters with distinctive epigenetic feature. Apart from this group of promoters, differentially methylated regions in the female and male X chromosomes were dominated by female hypomethylation. Our study furthers the understanding of X-chromosome dosage regulation by DNA methylation on the chromosomal level as well as on individual gene level."
38659646,Sodium acetate increases the productivity of HEK293 cells expressing the ECD-Her1 protein in batch cultures: experimental results and metabolic flux analysis.,"Human Embryonic Kidney cells (HEK293) are a popular host for recombinant protein expression and production in the biotechnological industry. This has driven within both, the scientific and the engineering communities, the search for strategies to increase their protein productivity. The present work is inserted into this search exploring the impact of adding sodium acetate (NaAc) into a batch culture of HEK293 cells. We monitored, as a function of time, the cell density, many external metabolites, and the supernatant concentration of the heterologous extra-cellular domain ECD-Her1 protein, a protein used to produce a candidate prostate cancer vaccine. We observed that by adding different concentrations of NaAc (0, 4, 6 and 8 mM), the production of ECD-Her1 protein increases consistently with increasing concentration, whereas the carrying capacity of the medium decreases. To understand these results we exploited a combination of experimental and computational techniques. Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) was used to infer intracellular metabolic fluxes from the concentration of external metabolites. Moreover, we measured independently the extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate of the cells. Both approaches support the idea that the addition of NaAc to the culture has a significant impact on the metabolism of the HEK293 cells and that, if properly tuned, enhances the productivity of the heterologous ECD-Her1 protein."
38659028,AZGP1 deficiency promotes angiogenesis in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Loss of AZGP1 expression is a biomarker associated with progression to castration resistance, development of metastasis, and poor disease-specific survival in prostate cancer. However, high expression of AZGP1 cells in prostate cancer has been reported to increase proliferation and invasion. The exact role of AZGP1 in prostate cancer progression remains elusive. METHOD: AZGP1 knockout and overexpressing prostate cancer cells were generated using a lentiviral system. The effects of AZGP1 under- or over-expression in prostate cancer cells were evaluated by in vitro cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. Heterozygous AZGP1(+/-) mice were obtained from European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA), and prostate tissues from homozygous knockout male mice were collected at 2, 6 and 10 months for histological analysis. In vivo xenografts generated from AZGP1 under- or over-expressing prostate cancer cells were used to determine the role of AZGP1 in prostate cancer tumor growth, and subsequent proteomics analysis was conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of AZGP1 action in prostate cancer progression. AZGP1 expression and microvessel density were measured in human prostate cancer samples on a tissue microarray of 215 independent patient samples. RESULT: Neither the knockout nor overexpression of AZGP1 exhibited significant effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation, clonal growth, migration, or invasion in vitro. The prostates of AZGP1(-/-) mice initially appeared to have grossly normal morphology; however, we observed fibrosis in the periglandular stroma and higher blood vessel density in the mouse prostate by 6 months. In PC3 and DU145 mouse xenografts, over-expression of AZGP1 did not affect tumor growth. Instead, these tumors displayed decreased microvessel density compared to xenografts derived from PC3 and DU145 control cells, suggesting that AZGP1 functions to inhibit angiogenesis in prostate cancer. Proteomics profiling further indicated that, compared to control xenografts, AZGP1 overexpressing PC3 xenografts are enriched with angiogenesis pathway proteins, including YWHAZ, EPHA2, SERPINE1, and PDCD6, MMP9, GPX1, HSPB1, COL18A1, RNH1, and ANXA1. In vitro functional studies show that AZGP1 inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tubular formation and branching. Additionally, tumor microarray analysis shows that AZGP1 expression is negatively correlated with blood vessel density in human prostate cancer tissues. CONCLUSION: AZGP1 is a negative regulator of angiogenesis, such that loss of AZGP1 promotes angiogenesis in prostate cancer. AZGP1 likely exerts heterotypical effects on cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as stromal and endothelial cells. This study sheds light on the anti-angiogenic characteristics of AZGP1 in the prostate and provides a rationale to target AZGP1 to inhibit prostate cancer progression."
38658974,Co-transcriptional R-loops-mediated epigenetic regulation drives growth retardation and docetaxel chemosensitivity enhancement in advanced prostate cancer.,"R-loops are prevalent three-stranded nucleic acid structures, comprising a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA, that frequently form during transcription and may be attributed to genomic stability and gene expression regulation. It was recently discovered that RNA modification contributes to maintain the stability of R-loops such as N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A). Yet, m(6)A-modified R-loops in regulating gene transcription remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BPs) recognize R-loops in an m(6)A-dependent way. Consequently, IGF2BPs overexpression leads to increased overall R-loop levels, cell migration inhibition, and cell growth retardation in prostate cancer (PCa) via precluding the binding of DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) to semaphorin 3 F (SEMA3F) promoters. Moreover, the K homology (KH) domains of IGF2BPs are required for their recognition of m(6)A-containing R-loops and are required for tumor suppressor functions. Overexpression of SEMA3F markedly enhanced docetaxel chemosensitivity in prostate cancer via regulating Hippo pathway. Our findings point to a distinct R-loop resolution pathway mediated by IGF2BPs, emphasizing the functional importance of IGF2BPs as epigenetic R-loop readers in transcriptional genetic regulation and cancer biology.The manuscript summarizes the new role of N6-methyladenosine in epigenetic regulation, we introduce the distinct R-loop resolution mediated by IGF2BP proteins in an m6A-dependent way, which probably lead to the growth retardation and docetaxel chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer. Moreover, our findings first emphasized the functional importance of IGF2BPs as epigenetic R-loop readers in transcriptional genetic regulation and cancer biology. In addition, our research provides a novel RBM15/IGF2BPs/DNMT1 trans-omics regulation m6A axis, indicating the new crosstalk between RNA m6A methylation and DNA methylation in prostate cancer."
38658471,Pan-Cancer Analysis Shows that KIFC2 is a Potential Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Biomarker for Multiple Cancer Types Including Bladder Cancer.,"KIFC2 plays an important role in prostate cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance, but the mechanism of its involvement in other malignancies remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze and validate the mechanism of effect of KIFC2 in multiple tumors. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in conjunction with multiple databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, Human Protein Atlas, etc.) to fully explore the potential role of KIFC2 within individual tumors and to analyze the correlation with major research components such as prognosis, mutations, and the tumor microenvironment. The expression of KIFC2 demonstrates a significant correlation with the prognosis, clinical phenotype, tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and tumor microenvironment across various malignancies and is associated with the modulation of diverse functional and signaling pathways. The differences in the expression of KIFC2 in the bladder cancer tissues (14 pairs) were statistically significant. The pan-cancer analysis in this study revealed the multifunctionality of KIFC2 in a variety of tumors, indicating a possible prognostic predictor and potential therapeutic target for tumors."
38657912,MTH1 inhibition synergizes with ROS-inducing agents to trigger cervical cancer cells undergoing parthanatos.,"Cervical cancer cells possess high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); thus, increasing oxidative stress above the toxicity threshold to induce cell death is a promising chemotherapeutic strategy. However, the underlying mechanisms of cell death are elusive, and efficacy and toxicity issues remain. Within DNA, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is the most frequent base lesion repaired by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1)-initiated base excision repair. Cancer cells also express high levels of MutT homolog 1 (MTH1), which prevents DNA replication-induced incorporation of 8-oxoG into the genome by hydrolyzing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP). Here, we revealed that ROS-inducing agents triggered cervical cancer to undergo parthanatos, which was mainly induced by massive DNA strand breaks resulting from overwhelming 8-oxoG excision by OGG1. Furthermore, the MTH1 inhibitor synergized with a relatively low dose of ROS-inducing agents by enhancing 8-oxoG loading in the DNA. In vivo, this drug combination suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts, and this inhibitory effect was significantly decreased in the absence of OGG1. Hence, the present study highlights the roles of base repair enzymes in cell death induction and suggests that the combination of lower doses of ROS-inducing agents with MTH1 inhibitors may be a more selective and safer strategy for cervical cancer chemotherapy."
38657881,Exposure to environmental pollutants and genetic variants related to oxidative stress and xenobiotic metabolism-Association with prostate cancer.,"This study assessed whether genetic variants coding for certain enzymes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, antioxidant defences and DNA repair, along with exposure to environmental chemicals, were associated with an increased prostate cancer (PCa) risk. The study population consisted of 300 men (150 PCa cases and 150 controls) which underwent prostate biopsy as their serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were greater than 4 ng/ml. Genetic variants in GSTM1, GSTP1, SOD2, CAT, GPX1, XRCC1 were determined and data for chemical exposures was obtained through a structured questionnaire and by biomonitoring in a subsample of cases and controls. High serum PSA levels were associated with a greater risk of PCa, while physical exercise appears to exert a protective effect against its development. In addition, elevated urinary levels of certain organic pollutants, such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), bisphenol A (BPA), and ethyl-paraben (EPB), were associated with an increased risk of PCa."
38657119,Single-cell analysis revealing the metabolic landscape of prostate cancer.,"Tumor metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer development, and targeting metabolic vulnerabilities has been proven to be an effective approach for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treatment. Nevertheless, treatment failure inevitably occurs, largely due to cellular heterogeneity, which cannot be deciphered by traditional bulk sequencing techniques. By employing computational pipelines for single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that epithelial cells within the prostate are more metabolically active and plastic than stromal cells. Moreover, we identified that neuroendocrine (NE) cells tend to have high metabolic rates, which might explain the high demand for nutrients and energy exhibited by neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), one of the most lethal variants of prostate cancer (PCa). Additionally, we demonstrated through computational and experimental approaches that variation in mitochondrial activity is the greatest contributor to metabolic heterogeneity among both tumor cells and nontumor cells. These results establish a detailed metabolic landscape of PCa, highlight a potential mechanism of disease progression, and emphasize the importance of future studies on tumor heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment from a metabolic perspective."
38655663,The LAT1 inhibitor JPH203 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer through a CD24-mediated mechanism.,"L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is specifically expressed in many malignancies, contributes to the transport of essential amino acids, such as leucine, and regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. We investigated the expression profile and functional role of LAT1 in prostate cancer using JPH203, a specific inhibitor of LAT1. LAT1 was highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells, including C4-2 and PC-3 cells, but its expression level was low in castration-sensitive LNCaP cells. JPH203 significantly inhibited [(14)C] leucine uptake in CRPC cells but had no effect in LNCaP cells. JPH203 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRPC cells but not of LNCaP cells. In C4-2 cells, Cluster of differentiation (CD) 24 was identified by RNA sequencing as a novel downstream target of JPH203. CD24 was downregulated in a JPH203 concentration-dependent manner and suppressed activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, an in vivo study showed that JPH203 inhibited the proliferation of C4-2 cells in a castration environment. The results of this study indicate that JPH203 may exert its antitumor effect in CRPC cells via mTOR and CD24."
38654435,"Molecular analysis of archival diagnostic prostate cancer biopsies identifies genomic similarities in cases with progression post-radiotherapy, and those with de novo metastatic disease.","BACKGROUND: It is important to identify molecular features that improve prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification before radical treatment with curative intent. Molecular analysis of historical diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate biopsies from cohorts with post-radiotherapy (RT) long-term clinical follow-up has been limited. Utilizing parallel sequencing modalities, we performed a proof-of-principle sequencing analysis of historical diagnostic FFPE prostate biopsies. We compared patients with (i) stable PCa (sPCa) postprimary or salvage RT, (ii) progressing PCa (pPCa) post-RT, and (iii) de novo metastatic PCa (mPCa). METHODS: A cohort of 19 patients with diagnostic prostate biopsies (n = 6 sPCa, n = 5 pPCa, n = 8 mPCa) and mean 4 years 10 months follow-up (diagnosed 2009-2016) underwent nucleic acid extraction from demarcated malignancy. Samples underwent 3'RNA sequencing (3'RNAseq) (n = 19), nanoString analysis (n = 12), and Illumina 850k methylation (n = 8) sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to coherently identify differentially expressed genes and methylated genomic regions (MGRs). RESULTS: Eighteen of 19 samples provided useable 3'RNAseq data. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated similar expression profiles between pPCa and mPCa cases, versus sPCa. Coherently differentially methylated probes between these groups identified ~600 differentially MGRs. The top 50 genes with increased expression in pPCa patients were associated with reduced progression-free survival post-RT (p < 0.0001) in an external cohort. CONCLUSIONS: 3'RNAseq, nanoString and 850k-methylation analyses are each achievable from historical FFPE diagnostic pretreatment prostate biopsies, unlocking the potential to utilize large cohorts of historic clinical samples. Profiling similarities between individuals with pPCa and mPCa suggests biological similarities and historical radiological staging limitations, which warrant further investigation."
38654106,Identification of genes that promote PI3K pathway activation and prostate tumour formation.,"We have performed a functional in vivo mutagenesis screen to identify genes that, when altered, cooperate with a heterozygous Pten mutation to promote prostate tumour formation. Two genes, Bzw2 and Eif5a2, which have been implicated in the process of protein translation, were selected for further validation. Using prostate organoid models, we show that either Bzw2 downregulation or EIF5A2 overexpression leads to increased organoid size and in vivo prostate growth. We show that both genes impact the PI3K pathway and drive a sustained increase in phospho-AKT expression, with PTEN protein levels reduced in both models. Mechanistic studies reveal that EIF5A2 is directly implicated in PTEN protein translation. Analysis of patient datasets identified EIF5A2 amplifications in many types of human cancer, including the prostate. Human prostate cancer samples in two independent cohorts showed a correlation between increased levels of EIF5A2 and upregulation of a PI3K pathway gene signature. Consistent with this, organoids with high levels of EIF5A2 were sensitive to AKT inhibitors. Our study identified novel genes that promote prostate cancer formation through upregulation of the PI3K pathway, predicting a strategy to treat patients with genetic aberrations in these genes particularly relevant for EIF5A2 amplified tumours."
38653037,Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Harboring Homologous Recombination Repair Mutations.,"BACKGROUND: There is currently limited literature assessing the real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations. METHODS: Medical charts were abstracted for mCRPC patients with >/= 1 of 12 HRR somatic gene alterations treated at US oncology centers participating in the American Association for Cancer Research Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange. Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes were assessed from the initiation of first-line or later (1L+) mCRPC therapy received on or after July 1, 2014. RESULTS: Among 138 patients included in the study, the most common somatic HRR mutations were CDK12 (47.8%), BRCA2 (22.5%), and ATM (21.0%). Novel hormonal therapy and taxane chemotherapy were most commonly used in 1L; taxane use increased in later lines. Median overall survival (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 36.3 (30.7-47.8) months from initiation of 1L therapy and decreased for subsequent lines. Similarly, there was a trend of decreasing progression-free survival and prostate-specific antigen response from 1L to 4L+ therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment patterns identified in this study were similar to those among patients with mCRPC regardless of tumor HRR mutation status in the literature."
38651944,"NKAIN1, as an oncogene, promotes the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer, affecting its prognosis.","Na, K-ATPase interaction (NKAIN) is a transmembrane protein family, which can interact with Na, K-ATPase beta1 subunit. NKAIN1 plays an important role in alcohol-dependent diseases such as endometrial and prostate cancers. However, the relationship between NKAIN1 and human breast cancer has not been studied. Hence, this study aimed to explore the relationship between NKAIN1 expression and breast cancer. Data used in this study were mainly from the Cancer Genome Atlas, including differential expression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, multiple Cox regression analysis, co-expression gene analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. Analyses were performed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry on 46 collected samples. The knockdown or overexpression of NKAIN1 in vitro in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines altered the proliferation and migration abilities of tumor cells. In vivo experiments further confirmed that NKAIN1 knockdown effectively inhibited the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Therefore, our study identified NKAIN1 as an oncogene that is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. The findings highlight the potential of NKAIN1 as a molecular biomarker of breast cancer."

38648082,Kinesin Facilitates Phenotypic Targeting of Therapeutic Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying resistance is critical to improving therapeutic outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Previous work showed that dynamic interconversions between epithelial-mesenchymal transition to mesenchymal-epithelial transition defines the phenotypic landscape of prostate tumors, as a potential driver of the emergence of therapeutic resistance. In this study, we use in vitro and in vivo preclinical MDA PCa patient-derived xenograft models of resistant human prostate cancer to determine molecular mechanisms of cross-resistance between antiandrogen therapy and taxane chemotherapy, underlying the therapeutically resistant phenotype. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that resistant and sensitive prostate cancer C4-2B cells have a unique differential gene signature response to cabazitaxel. Gene pathway analysis showed that sensitive cells exhibit an increase in DNA damage, while resistant cells express genes associated with protein regulation in response to cabazitaxel. The patient-derived xenograft model specimens are from patients who have metastatic lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer, treated with androgen deprivation therapy, antiandrogens, and chemotherapy including second-line taxane chemotherapy, cabazitaxel. Immunohistochemistry revealed high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin resulting in redifferentiation toward an epithelial phenotype. Furthermore, the mitotic kinesin-related protein involved in microtubule binding and the SLCO1B3 transporter (implicated in cabazitaxel intracellular transport) are associated with resistance in these prostate tumors. Combinational targeting of kinesins (ispinesib) with cabazitaxel was more effective than single monotherapies in inducing cell death in resistant prostate tumors. Implications: Our findings are of translational significance in identifying kinesin as a novel target of cross-resistance toward enhancing therapeutic vulnerability and improved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced prostate cancer."
38647375,Y Chromosome Loss and Implications for Oncology.,"The Y chromosome has recognized functions in promoting male sex determination and regulating aspects of fertility. However, recent work has demonstrated important roles for the Y chromosome and Y-encoded genes in multiple domains of male health, including cancer. It is well established that males experience shorter lifespans than females, and this sex bias on overall mortality is accentuated in populations with longer life expectancy, in part related to elevated rates of cancer. The majority of human malignancies exhibit a sex bias with elevated frequencies in males. For many of these cancer types, the disparity has not been explained by environmental risk factors such as tobacco use. Notably, loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) detected in blood cells, termed mosaic LOY, is a common event that is related to advancing age and is associated with a shortened lifespan. Mosaic LOY is linked to increased incidence and mortality across a range of malignancies. Furthermore, tumors arising in different anatomic sites exhibit different frequencies of partial or complete Y chromosome loss. Causal oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles have been documented for several Y-encoded genes, such as lysine-specific demethylase 5 D, that exert pleiotropic effects on cellular functions by virtue of genome-wide regulation of gene activity. In this review, we discuss aspects of the Y chromosome relevant to oncology. The recent completion of the entire human Y-chromosome sequence provides a reference map of Y-encoded genes and regulatory elements to enable causal molecular studies that may explain and exploit the marked disparity in male cancer risk and mortality."
38647131,Metabolic characterization of sphere-derived prostate cancer stem cells reveals aberrant urea cycle in stemness maintenance.,"Alteration of cell metabolism is one of the essential characteristics of tumor growth. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the initiating cells of tumorigenesis, proliferation, recurrence, and other processes, and play an important role in therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Thus, identification of the metabolic profiles in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) is critical to understanding prostate cancer progression. Using untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics methods, we show distinct metabolic differences between prostate cancer cells and PCSCs. Urea cycle is the most significantly altered metabolic pathway in PCSCs, the key metabolites arginine and proline are evidently elevated. Proline promotes cancer stem-like characteristics via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), which catalyzes the conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid to proline, is highly expressed in PCSCs, and the inhibition of PYCR1 suppresses the stem-like characteristics of prostate cancer cells and tumor growth. In addition, carnitine and free fatty acid levels are significantly increased, indicating reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism in PCSCs. Reduced sphingolipid levels and increased triglyceride levels are also observed. Collectively, our data illustrate the comprehensive landscape of the metabolic reprogramming of PCSCs and provide potential therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer."
38645136,Collateral damage of NUDT15 deficiency in cancer provides a cancer pharmacogenetic therapeutic window with thiopurines.,"Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer and are driven by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Despite successes seen with select targeted therapeutics, this type of personalized medicine is only beneficial for a small subpopulation of cancer patients who have one of a few actionable genetic changes. Most tumors also contain hundreds of passenger mutations that offered no fitness advantage or disadvantage during tumor evolution. Mutations in known pharmacogenetic (PGx) loci for which germline variants encode variability in drug response can cause somatically acquired drug sensitivity. The NUDT15 gene is a known PGx locus that participates in the rate-limiting metabolism of thiopurines. People with two defective germline alleles of NUDT15 are hypersensitive to the toxic effects of thiopurines. NUDT15 is located adjacent to the Retinoblastoma ( RB1 ) tumor suppressor gene, which often undergoes homozygous deletion in retinoblastomas and other epithelial cancers. We observed that RB1 undergoes homozygous deletions in 9.4% of prostate adenocarcinomas and 2.5% of ovarian cancers, and in nearly all of these cases NUDT15 is also lost. Moreover, 44% of prostate adenocarcinomas and over 60% of ovarian cancers have lost one allele of NUDT15, which predicts that a majority of all prostate and ovarian cancers have somatically acquired hypersensitivity to thiopurine treatment. We performed a retrospective analysis of >16,000 patients in the US Veterans Administration health care system and found concurrent xanthine oxidase inhibition (XOi) and thiopurine usage for non-cancer indications is significantly associated with reduced incidence of prostate cancer. The hazard ratio for the development of prostate cancer in patients treated with thiopurines and XOi was 0.562 (0.301-1.051) for the unmatched cohort and 0.389 (0.185-0.819) for the propensity score matched cohort. We experimentally depleted NUDT15 from ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines and observed a dramatic sensitization to thiopurine-induced and DNA damage-dependent toxicity. These results indicate that somatic loss of NUDT15 predicts therapeutic sensitivity to a low cost and well tolerated drug with a broad therapeutic window."
38645058,Combined SNPs sequencing and allele specific proteomics capture reveal functional causality underpinning the 2p25 prostate cancer susceptibility locus.,"Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous risk loci associated with prostate cancer, yet unraveling their functional significance remains elusive. Leveraging our high-throughput SNPs-seq method, we pinpointed rs4519489 within the multi-ancestry GWAS-discovered 2p25 locus as a potential functional SNP due to its significant allelic differences in protein binding. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of rs4519489 and its associated gene, NOL10, employing diverse cohort data and experimental models. Clinical findings reveal a synergistic effect between rs4519489 genotype and NOL10 expression on prostate cancer prognosis and severity. Through unbiased proteomics screening, we reveal that the risk allele A of rs4519489 exhibits enhanced binding to USF1, a novel oncogenic transcription factor (TF) implicated in prostate cancer progression and prognosis, resulting in elevated NOL10 expression. Furthermore, we elucidate that NOL10 regulates cell cycle pathways, fostering prostate cancer progression. The concurrent expression of NOL10 and USF1 correlates with aggressive prostate cancer characteristics and poorer prognosis. Collectively, our study offers a robust strategy for functional SNP screening and TF identification through high-throughput SNPs-seq and unbiased proteomics, highlighting the rs4519489-USF1-NOL10 regulatory axis as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer."
38645014,Increased frequency of CHD1 deletions in prostate cancers of African American men is associated with rapid disease progression without inducing homologous recombination deficiency.,"We analyzed genomic data derived from the prostate cancer of African and European American men in order to identify differences that may contribute to racial disparity of outcome and that could also define novel therapeutic strategies. In addition to analyzing patient derived next generation sequencing data, we performed FISH based confirmatory studies of Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) loss on prostate cancer tissue microarrays. We created CRISPR edited, CHD1 deficient prostate cancer cell lines for genomic, drug sensitivity and functional homologous recombination (HR) activity analysis. We found that subclonal deletion of CHD1 is nearly three times as frequent in prostate tumors of African American men than in men of European ancestry and it associates with rapid disease progression. We further showed that CHD1 deletion is not associated with homologous recombination deficiency associated mutational signatures in prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell line models CHD1 deletion did not induce HR deficiency as detected by RAD51 foci formation assay or mutational signatures, which was consistent with the moderate increase of olaparib sensitivity. CHD1 deficient prostate cancer cells, however, showed higher sensitivity to talazoparib. CHD1 loss may contribute to worse outcome of prostate cancer in African American men. A deeper understanding of the interaction between CHD1 loss and PARP inhibitor sensitivity will be needed to determine the optimal use of targeted agents such as talazoparib in the context of castration resistant prostate cancer."
38644292,[Bioinformatics-based analysis of the effect of general Transcription Factor IIH on prognosis of Prostate cancer].,"Objective: To investigate the genetic and expression characteristics of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) in pre-initiationcomplex in prostate cancer (PCa) and its relationship with prostate cancer progression. Methods: Analyzing the expression characteristics and clinical signification of TFIIH subunits about 495 cases of PCa and 52 cases of adjacent cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) database. PCa microarray chip was used to verify the correlation between the key factor General Transcription Factor IIH Subunit 4 (GTF2H4) in TFIIH and clinical features. Results: The 495 patients with PCa were (61.01+/-6.82) years old.The mRNA expression of ERCC3、GTF2H4 and MNAT1 were high in PCa tissues with GS>/=8(P<0.05). The expression of GTF2H4 and MNAT1 were relevant to the pathological stages(P<0.05). High expression of GTF2H4 has higher biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate in PCa patients(HR=2.47, 95%CI:1.62-3.77, P<0.001), which has better predictive effect of BCR in PCa patients(The 3rd, 5th, and 7th year AUC all>0.7) than other subunits, and it has been verified in four additional databases. Single-factor Cox regression analysis showed that GTF2H4 were risk factors for BCR (HR=2.470, 95%CI:1.620-3.767, P<0.001) and GTF2H5 were protective factors(HR=0.506,95%CI: 0.336-0.762, P=0.001). The results of immunohistochemical staining showed that the protein expression of GTF2H4 was correlated with the clinical features of PCa patients.The differences of the above results were statistically significant. Conclusion: GTF2H4, the key factor of TFIIH, is highly expressed in PCa and indicates a poor prognosis."
38643190,Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes as prognostic and immunogenic biomarkers in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The metastasis and aggressive nature of prostate cancer (PCa) has become a major malignancy related threat that concerns men's health. The efficacy of immune monotherapy against PCa is questionable due to its lymphocyte-suppressive nature. METHOD: Endoplasmic reticulum stress- (ERS-) and PCa-prognosis-related genes were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database and the Cancer Genome Atlas database. The expression, prognosis and immune infiltration values of key genes were explored by ""survival R package"", ""rms"", ""xCELL algorithm"", and univariate-multivariate Cox and LASSO regression analyses. The ""consensus cluster plus R package"" was used for cluster analysis. RESULT: As ERS-related genes, ERLIN2 and CDK5RAP3 showed significant expressional, prognostic and clinic-pathologic values. They were defined as the key genes significantly correlated with immune infiltration and response. The nomogram was constructed with T-stage and primary treatment outcome, and the risk-prognostic model was constructed in the following way: Riskscore = (- 0.1918) * ERLIN2 + (0.5254) * CDK5RAP3. Subsequently, prognostic subgroups based on key genes classified the high-risk group as a pro-cancer subgroup that had lower mutation rates of critical genes (SPOP and MUC16), multiple low-expression immune-relevant molecules, and differences in macrophages (M1 and M2) expressions. Finally, ERLIN2 as an anti-oncogene and CDK5RAP3 as a pro-oncogene were further confirmed by cell phenotype assays and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: We identified ERLIN2 and CDK5RAP3 as ERS-related genes with important prognostic and immunologic values, and classified patients between high- and low-risk subgroups, which provided new prognostic markers, immunotherapeutic targets, and basis for prognostic assessments."
38636493,miRNAs mediate the impact of smoking on dental pulp stem cells via the p53 pathway.,"Cigarette smoke changes the genomic and epigenomic imprint of cells. In this study, we investigated the biological consequences of extended cigarette smoke exposure on dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and the potential roles of miRNAs. DPSCs were treated with various doses of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) for up to 6 weeks. Cell proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation were evaluated. Cytokine and miRNA expression were profiled. The results showed that extended exposure to CSC significantly impaired the regenerative capacity of the DPSCs. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the cell cycle pathway, cancer pathways (small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, colorectal, and prostate cancer), and pathways for TNF, TGF-beta, p53, PI3K-Akt, mTOR, and ErbB signal transduction, were associated with altered miRNA profiles. In particular, 3 miRNAs has-miR-26a-5p, has-miR-26b-5p, and has-miR-29b-3p fine-tune the p53 and cell cycle signaling pathways to regulate DPSC cellular activities. The work indicated that miRNAs are promising targets to modulate stem cell regeneration and understanding miRNA-targeted genes and their associated pathways in smoking individuals have significant implications for disease control and prevention."
38635932,Transcriptome-Based Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker Analysis of ENACT: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Enzalutamide in Men Undergoing Active Surveillance.,"PURPOSE: Few studies have explored the potential for pharmacological interventions to delay disease progression in patients undergoing active surveillance (AS). This preplanned transcriptomic analysis of patient samples from the ENACT trial aims to identify biomarkers in patients on AS who are at increased risk for disease progression or who may derive the greatest benefit from enzalutamide treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the phase II ENACT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02799745) trial, patients on AS were randomly assigned 1:1 to 160 mg orally once daily enzalutamide monotherapy or continued AS for 1 year. Transcriptional analyses were conducted on biopsies collected at trial screening, year 1, and year 2. Three gene expression signatures were evaluated in samples collected at screening and in available samples from patients on AS at any time during surveillance (expanded cohort): Decipher genomic classifier, androgen receptor activity (AR-A) score, and Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50 (PAM50) cell subtype signature. RESULTS: The Decipher genomic classifier score was prognostic; higher scores were associated with disease progression in the expanded cohort and AS arm of the expanded cohort. Patients with higher Decipher scores had greater positive treatment effect from enzalutamide as measured by time to secondary rise in prostate-specific antigen >25% above baseline. In patients treated with enzalutamide, higher AR-A scores and PAM50 luminal subtypes were associated with a greater likelihood of negative biopsy incidence at year 2. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that the Decipher genomic classifier may be prognostic for disease progression in AS patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Higher Decipher and AR-A scores, as well as PAM50 luminal subtypes, may also serve as biomarkers for treatment response."
38635637,The Myc-associated zinc finger protein epigenetically controls expression of interferon-gamma-stimulated genes by recruiting STAT1 to chromatin.,"The MYC-Associated Zinc Finger Protein (MAZ) plays important roles in chromatin organization and gene transcription regulation. Dysregulated expression of MAZ causes diseases, such as glioblastoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and liposarcoma. Previously, it has been reported that MAZ controls the proinflammatory response in colitis and colon cancer via STAT3 signaling, suggesting that MAZ is involved in regulating immunity-related pathways. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation remains elusive. Here, we investigate the regulatory effect of MAZ on interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-stimulated genes via STAT1, a protein that plays an essential role in immune responses to viral, fungal, and mycobacterial pathogens. We demonstrate that about 80% of occupied STAT1-binding sites colocalize with occupied MAZ-binding sites in HAP1/K562 cells after IFN-gamma stimulation. MAZ depletion significantly reduces STAT1 binding in the genome. By analyzing genome-wide gene expression profiles in the RNA-Seq data, we show that MAZ depletion significantly suppresses a subset of the immune response genes, which include the IFN-stimulated genes IRF8 and Absent in Melanoma 2. Furthermore, we find that MAZ controls expression of the immunity-related genes by changing the epigenetic landscape in chromatin. Our study reveals an important role for MAZ in regulating immune-related gene expression."
38635241,Development and Validation of an 18-Gene Urine Test for High-Grade Prostate Cancer.,"IMPORTANCE: Benefits of prostate cancer (PCa) screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone are largely offset by excess negative biopsies and overdetection of indolent cancers resulting from the poor specificity of PSA for high-grade PCa (ie, grade group [GG] 2 or greater). OBJECTIVE: To develop a multiplex urinary panel for high-grade PCa and validate its external performance relative to current guideline-endorsed biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: RNA sequencing analysis of 58 724 genes identified 54 markers of PCa, including 17 markers uniquely overexpressed by high-grade cancers. Gene expression and clinical factors were modeled in a new urinary test for high-grade PCa (MyProstateScore 2.0 [MPS2]). Optimal models were developed in parallel without prostate volume (MPS2) and with prostate volume (MPS2+). The locked models underwent blinded external validation in a prospective National Cancer Institute trial cohort. Data were collected from January 2008 to December 2020, and data were analyzed from November 2022 to November 2023. EXPOSURE: Protocolized blood and urine collection and transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multiple biomarker tests were assessed in the validation cohort, including serum PSA alone, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator, and the Prostate Health Index (PHI) as well as derived multiplex 2-gene and 3-gene models, the original 2-gene MPS test, and the 18-gene MPS2 models. Under a testing approach with 95% sensitivity for PCa of GG 2 or greater, measures of diagnostic accuracy and clinical consequences of testing were calculated. Cancers of GG 3 or greater were assessed secondarily. RESULTS: Of 761 men included in the development cohort, the median (IQR) age was 63 (58-68) years, and the median (IQR) PSA level was 5.6 (4.6-7.2) ng/mL; of 743 men included in the validation cohort, the median (IQR) age was 62 (57-68) years, and the median (IQR) PSA level was 5.6 (4.1-8.0) ng/mL. In the validation cohort, 151 (20.3%) had high-grade PCa on biopsy. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values were 0.60 using PSA alone, 0.66 using the risk calculator, 0.77 using PHI, 0.76 using the derived multiplex 2-gene model, 0.72 using the derived multiplex 3-gene model, and 0.74 using the original MPS model compared with 0.81 using the MPS2 model and 0.82 using the MPS2+ model. At 95% sensitivity, the MPS2 model would have reduced unnecessary biopsies performed in the initial biopsy population (range for other tests, 15% to 30%; range for MPS2, 35% to 42%) and repeat biopsy population (range for other tests, 9% to 21%; range for MPS2, 46% to 51%). Across pertinent subgroups, the MPS2 models had negative predictive values of 95% to 99% for cancers of GG 2 or greater and of 99% for cancers of GG 3 or greater. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, a new 18-gene PCa test had higher diagnostic accuracy for high-grade PCa relative to existing biomarker tests. Clinically, use of this test would have meaningfully reduced unnecessary biopsies performed while maintaining highly sensitive detection of high-grade cancers. These data support use of this new PCa biomarker test in patients with elevated PSA levels to reduce the potential harms of PCa screening while preserving its long-term benefits."
38633597,Updates on Overcoming Bicalutamide Resistance: A Glimpse into Resistance to a Novel Antiandrogen.,"The standard androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer includes the use of bicalutamide, which is a well-known antagonist of androgen receptors. Despite numerous benefits of the drugs in prostate cancer treatment, there is always a risk of developing a resistant phenotype, which paves the way for a more aggressive and low-survival type of prostate cancer. Over the years, many studies have investigated the candidate mechanisms of such resistance and have managed to find possible therapeutic solutions. In this Review, we shed light on the heterogeneous dynamics of progression to resistance against bicalutamide treatment, referring to the most recent studies and the approaches that have been so far discussed. This Review tries to offer a deep and comprehensive understanding about how the resistant cells become sensitive to the drug and what corresponding pathways lead to an appropriate solution for the antiandrogen resistance challenge."
38632928,LectoScape: A Highly Multiplexed Imaging Platform for Glycome Analysis and Biomedical Diagnosis.,"Glycosylation, a fundamental biological process, involves the attachment of glycans to proteins, lipids, and RNA, and it plays a crucial role in various biological pathways. It is of great significance to obtain the precise spatial distribution of glycosylation modifications at the cellular and tissue levels. Here, we introduce LectoScape, an innovative method enabling detailed imaging of tissue glycomes with up to 1 mum resolution through image mass cytometry (IMC). This method utilizes 12 distinct, nonoverlapping lectins selected via microarray technology, enabling the multiplexed detection of a wide array of glycans. Furthermore, we developed an efficient labeling strategy for these lectins. Crucially, our approach facilitates the concurrent imaging of diverse glycan motifs, including N-glycan and O-glycan, surpassing the capabilities of existing technologies. Using LectoScape, we have successfully delineated unique glycan structures in various cell types, enhancing our understanding of the glycan distribution across human tissues. Our method has identified specific glycan markers, such as alpha2,3-sialylated Galbeta1, 3GalNAc in O-glycan, and terminal GalNAc, as diagnostic indicators for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This highlights the potential of LectoScape in cancer diagnostics through the detection of abnormal glycosylation patterns."
38632701,FOXA1 regulates ribosomal RNA transcription in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Ribosome biogenesis is excessively activated in tumor cells, yet it is little known whether oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) are involved in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transactivation. METHODS: Nucleolar proteomics data and large-scale immunofluorescence were re-analyzed to jointly identify the proteins localized at nucleolus. RNA-Seq data of five prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts were combined and integrated with multi-dimensional data to define the upregulated nucleolar TFs in PCa tissues. Then, ChIP-Seq data of PCa cell lines and two PCa clinical cohorts were re-analyzed to reveal the TF binding patterns at ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats. The TF binding at rDNA was validated by ChIP-qPCR. The effect of the TF on rRNA transcription was determined by rDNA luciferase reporter, nascent RNA synthesis, and global protein translation assays. RESULTS: In this study, we reveal the role of oncogenic TF FOXA1 in regulating rRNA transcription within nucleolar organization regions. By analyzing human TFs in prostate cancer clinical datasets and nucleolar proteomics data, we identified that FOXA1 is partially localized in the nucleolus and correlated with global protein translation. Our extensive FOXA1 ChIP-Seq analysis provides robust evidence of FOXA1 binding across rDNA repeats in prostate cancer cell lines, primary tumors, and castration-resistant variants. Notably, FOXA1 occupancy at rDNA repeats correlates with histone modifications associated with active transcription, namely H3K27ac and H3K4me3. Reducing FOXA1 expression results in decreased transactivation at rDNA, subsequently diminishing global protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest FOXA1 regulates aberrant ribosome biogenesis downstream of oncogenic signaling in prostate cancer."
38632662,An early-onset specific polygenic risk score optimizes age-based risk estimate and stratification of prostate cancer: population-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Early-onset prostate cancer (EOPC, </= 55 years) has a unique clinical entity harboring high genetic risk, but the majority of EOPC patients still substantial opportunity to be early-detected thus suffering an unfavorable prognosis. A refined understanding of age-based polygenic risk score (PRS) for prostate cancer (PCa) would be essential for personalized risk stratification. METHODS: We included 167,517 male participants [4882 cases including 205 EOPC and 4677 late-onset PCa (LOPC)] from UK Biobank. A General-, an EOPC- and an LOPC-PRS were derived from age-specific genome-wide association studies. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the risk of PCa associated with PRSs. The discriminatory capability of PRSs were validated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with additional 4238 males from PLCO and TCGA. Phenome-wide association studies underlying Mendelian Randomization were conducted to discover EOPC linking phenotypes. RESULTS: The 269-PRS calculated via well-established risk variants was more strongly associated with risk of EOPC [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.99-2.78] than LOPC (HR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.89-2.01; I(2) = 79%). EOPC-PRS was dramatically related to EOPC risk (HR = 4.70, 95% CI 3.98-5.54) but not to LOPC (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.01), while LOPC-PRS had similar risk estimates for EOPC and LOPC (I(2) = 0%). Particularly, EOPC-PRS performed optimal discriminatory capability for EOPC (area under the ROC = 0.613). Among the phenomic factors to PCa deposited in the platform of ProAP (Prostate cancer Age-based PheWAS; https://mulongdu.shinyapps.io/proap ), EOPC was preferentially associated with PCa family history while LOPC was prone to environmental and lifestyles exposures. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively profiled the distinct genetic and phenotypic architecture of EOPC. The EOPC-PRS may optimize risk estimate of PCa in young males, particularly those without family history, thus providing guidance for precision population stratification."
38632333,A multi-cancer early detection blood test using machine learning detects early-stage cancers lacking USPSTF-recommended screening.,"US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend single-cancer screening for select cancers (e.g., breast, cervical, colorectal, lung). Advances in genome sequencing and machine learning have facilitated the development of blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests intended to complement single-cancer screening. MCED tests can interrogate circulating cell-free DNA to detect a shared cancer signal across multiple tumor types. We report real-world experience with an MCED test that detected cancer signals in three individuals subsequently diagnosed with cancers of the ovary, kidney, and head/neck that lack USPSTF-recommended screening. These cases illustrate the potential of MCED tests to detect early-stage cancers amenable to cure."
38630784,Bayesian approach to assessing population differences in genetic risk of disease with application to prostate cancer.,"Population differences in risk of disease are common, but the potential genetic basis for these differences is not well understood. A standard approach is to compare genetic risk across populations by testing for mean differences in polygenic scores, but existing studies that use this approach do not account for statistical noise in effect estimates (i.e., the GWAS betas) that arise due to the finite sample size of GWAS training data. Here, we show using Bayesian polygenic score methods that the level of uncertainty in estimates of genetic risk differences across populations is highly dependent on the GWAS training sample size, the polygenicity (number of causal variants), and genetic distance (FST) between the populations considered. We derive a Wald test for formally assessing the difference in genetic risk across populations, which we show to have calibrated type 1 error rates under a simplified assumption that all SNPs are independent, which we achieve in practise using linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning. We further provide closed-form expressions for assessing the uncertainty in estimates of relative genetic risk across populations under the special case of an infinitesimal genetic architecture. We suggest that for many complex traits and diseases, particularly those with more polygenic architectures, current GWAS sample sizes are insufficient to detect moderate differences in genetic risk across populations, though more substantial differences in relative genetic risk (relative risk > 1.5) can be detected. We show that conventional approaches that do not account for sampling error from the training sample, such as using a simple t-test, have very high type 1 error rates. When applying our approach to prostate cancer, we demonstrate a higher genetic risk in African Ancestry men, with lower risk in men of European followed by East Asian ancestry."
38630576,Human malignancies associated with persistent HPV infection.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated malignancies account for ~5% of human cancers worldwide. Thirteen, or more, HPV types are oncogenic, but infection with these viruses is common and usually cleared within 2 years. Only infections that become persistent are associated with the development of cancer, often occurring several decades later. These cancers mostly arise in 6 different anatomical regions: 5 are anogenital (anus, cervix, penis, vagina, and vulva) and the sixth is the oropharynx. Oncogenic HPVs promote cellular proliferation and genomic instability, but the anatomical niche of the target tissue also plays an important role in the development of cancer. Cells that reside in transitional regions between different types of epithelia, such as in the anus, cervix, and oropharynx, are particularly vulnerable to oncogenesis."
38629578,Understanding and overcoming resistance to immunotherapy in genitourinary cancers.,"The introduction of novel immunotherapies has significantly transformed the treatment landscape of genitourinary (GU) cancers, even becoming the standard of care in some settings. One such type of immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like nivolumab, ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab play a pivotal role by disturbing signaling pathways that limit the immune system's ability to fight tumor cells. Despite the profound impact of these treatments, not all tumors are responsive. Recent research efforts have been focused on understanding how cancer cells manage to evade the immune response and identifying the possible mechanisms behind resistance to immunotherapy. In response, ICIs are being combined with other treatments to reduce resistance and attack cancer cells through multiple cellular pathways. Additionally, novel, targeted strategies are currently being investigated to develop innovative methods of overcoming resistance and treatment failure. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GU cancers as currently described in the literature. It explores studies that have identified genetic markers, cytokines, and proteins that may predict resistance or response to immunotherapy. Additionally, we review current efforts to overcome this resistance, which include combination ICIs and sequential therapies, novel insights into the host immune profile, and new targeted therapies. Various approaches that combine immunotherapy with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, vaccines, and radiation have been studied in an effort to more effectively overcome resistance to immunotherapy. While each of these combination therapies has shown some efficacy in clinical trials, a deeper understanding of the immune system's role underscores the potential of novel targeted therapies as a particularly promising area of current research. Currently, several targeted agents are in development, along with the identification of key immune mediators involved in immunotherapy resistance. Further research is necessary to identify predictors of response."

38625939,Integrated mutational landscape analysis of poorly differentiated high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix.,"High-grade neuroendocrine cervical cancers (NETc) are exceedingly rare, highly aggressive tumors. We analyzed 64 NETc tumor samples by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 65.6% (42/64) of the tumors. Recurrent mutations were identified in PIK3CA, KMT2D/MLL2, K-RAS, ARID1A, NOTCH2, and RPL10. The top mutated genes included RB1, ARID1A, PTEN, KMT2D/MLL2, and WDFY3, a gene not yet implicated in NETc. Somatic CNV analysis identified two copy number gains (3q27.1 and 19q13.12) and five copy number losses (1p36.21/5q31.3/6p22.2/9q21.11/11p15.5). Also, gene fusions affecting the ACLY-CRHR1 and PVT1-MYC genes were identified in one of the eight samples subjected to RNA sequencing. To resolve evolutionary history, multiregion WES in NETc admixed with adenocarcinoma cells was performed (i.e., mixed-NETc). Phylogenetic analysis of mixed-NETc demonstrated that adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine elements derive from a common precursor with mutations typical of adenocarcinomas. Over one-third (22/64) of NETc demonstrated a mutator phenotype of C > T at CpG consistent with deficiencies in MBD4, a member of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Mutations in the PI3K/AMPK pathways were identified in 49/64 samples. We used two patient-derived-xenografts (PDX) (i.e., NET19 and NET21) to evaluate the activity of pan-HER (afatinib), PIK3CA (copanlisib), and ATR (elimusertib) inhibitors, alone and in combination. PDXs harboring alterations in the ERBB2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ATR pathway were sensitive to afatinib, copanlisib, and elimusertib (P < 0.001 vs. controls). However, combinations of copanlisib/afatinib and copanlisib/elimusertib were significantly more effective in controlling NETc tumor growth. These findings define the genetic landscape of NETc and suggest that a large subset of these highly lethal malignancies might benefit from existing targeted therapies."
38625612,"Diagnostic performance of [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT, MRI of the spine, and whole-body diagnostic CT and MRI in the detection of spinal bone metastases associated with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT, MRI of the spine, and whole-body CT and MRI for the detection of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL)-related spinal bone metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2014 and 2020, PPGL participants with spinal bone metastases prospectively underwent [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT, MRI of the cervical-thoracolumbar spine (MRI(spine)), contrast-enhanced MRI of the neck and thoraco-abdominopelvic regions (MRI(WB)), and contrast-enhanced CT of the neck and thoraco-abdominopelvic regions (CT(WB)). Per-patient and per-lesion detection rates were calculated. Counting of spinal bone metastases was limited to a maximum of one lesion per vertebrae. A composite of all functional and anatomic imaging served as an imaging comparator. The McNemar test compared detection rates between the scans. Two-sided p values were reported. RESULTS: Forty-three consecutive participants (mean age, 41.7 +/- 15.7 years; females, 22) with MRI(spine) were included who also underwent [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT (n = 43), [(18)F]FDG PET/CT (n = 43), MRI(WB) (n = 24), and CT(WB) (n = 33). Forty-one of 43 participants were positive for spinal bone metastases, with 382 lesions on the imaging comparator. [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT demonstrated a per-lesion detection rate of 377/382 (98.7%) which was superior compared to [(18)F]FDG (72.0%, 275/382, p < 0.001), MRI(spine) (80.6%, 308/382, p < 0.001), MRI(WB) (55.3%, 136/246, p < 0.001), and CT(WB) (44.8%, 132/295, p < 0.001). The per-patient detection rate of [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT was 41/41 (100%) which was higher compared to [(18)F]FDG PET/CT (90.2%, 37/41, p = 0.13), MRI(spine) (97.6%, 40/41, p = 1.00), MRI(WB) (95.7%, 22/23, p = 1.00), and CT(WB) (81.8%, 27/33, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT should be the modality of choice in PPGL-related spinal bone metastases due to its superior detection rate. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In a prospective study of 43 pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma participants with spinal bone metastases, [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT had a superior per-lesion detection rate of 98.7% (377/382), compared to [(18)F]FDG PET/CT (p < 0.001), MRI of the spine (p < 0.001), whole-body CT (p < 0.001), and whole-body MRI (p < 0.001). KEY POINTS: * Data regarding head-to-head comparison between functional and anatomic imaging modalities to detect spinal bone metastases in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma are limited. * [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT had a superior per-lesion detection rate of 98.7% in the detection of spinal bone metastases associated with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma compared to other imaging modalities: [(18)]F-FDG PET/CT, MRI of the spine, whole-body CT, and whole-body MRI. * [(68)Ga]DOTATATE PET/CT should be the modality of choice in the evaluation of spinal bone metastases associated with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma."
38624210,HPV oncogenes expressed from only one of multiple integrated HPV DNA copies drive clonal cell expansion in cervical cancer.,"The integration of HPV DNA into human chromosomes plays a pivotal role in the onset of papillomavirus-related cancers. HPV DNA integration often occurs by linearizing the viral DNA in the E1/E2 region, resulting in the loss of a critical viral early polyadenylation signal (PAS), which is essential for the polyadenylation of the E6E7 bicistronic transcripts and for the expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes. Here, we provide compelling evidence that, despite the presence of numerous integrated viral DNA copies, virus-host fusion transcripts originate from only a single integrated HPV DNA in HPV16 and HPV18 cervical cancers and cervical cancer-derived cell lines. The host genomic elements neighboring the integrated HPV DNA are critical for the efficient expression of the viral oncogenes that leads to clonal cell expansion. The fusion RNAs that are produced use a host RNA polyadenylation signal downstream of the integration site, and almost all involve splicing to host sequences. In cell culture, siRNAs specifically targeting the host portion of the virus-host fusion transcripts effectively silenced viral E6 and E7 expression. This, in turn, inhibited cell growth and promoted cell senescence in HPV16+ CaSki and HPV18+ HeLa cells. Showing that HPV E6 and E7 expression from a single integration site is instrumental in clonal cell expansion sheds new light on the mechanisms of HPV-induced carcinogenesis and could be used for the development of precision medicine tailored to combat HPV-related malignancies. IMPORTANCE: Persistent oncogenic HPV infections lead to viral DNA integration into the human genome and the development of cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. The expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes plays a key role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis. However, how E6 and E7 could be expressed from the integrated viral DNA which often lacks a viral polyadenylation signal in the cancer cells remains unknown. By analyzing the integrated HPV DNA sites and expressed HPV RNAs in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, we show that HPV oncogenes are expressed from only one of multiple chromosomal HPV DNA integrated copies. A host polyadenylation signal downstream of the integrated viral DNA is used for polyadenylation and stabilization of the virus-host chimeric RNAs, making the oncogenic transcripts targetable by siRNAs. This observation provides further understanding of the tumorigenic mechanism of HPV integration and suggests possible therapeutic strategies for the development of precision medicine for HPV cancers."
38619781,Clinical features of prostate cancer by polygenic risk score.,"Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 290 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with prostate cancer. These SNVs can be combined to generate a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), which estimates an individual's risk to develop prostate cancer. Identifying individuals at higher risk for prostate cancer using PRS could allow for personalized screening recommendations, improve current screening tools, and potentially result in improved survival rates, but more research is needed before incorporating them into clinical use. Our study aimed to investigate associations between PRS and clinical factors in affected individuals, including age of diagnosis, metastases, histology, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group (GG) and family history of prostate cancer, while taking into account germline genetic testing in known prostate cancer related genes. To evaluate the relationship between these clinical factors and PRS, a quantitative retrospective chart review of 250 individuals of European ancestry diagnosed with prostate cancer who received genetic counseling services at The Ohio State University's Genitourinary Cancer Genetics Clinic and a 72-SNV PRS through Ambry Genetics, was performed. We found significant associations between higher PRS and younger age of diagnosis (p = 0.002), lower frequency of metastases (p = 0.006), and having a first-degree relative diagnosed with prostate cancer (p = 0.024). We did not observe significant associations between PRS and ISUP GG, histology or a having a second-degree relative with prostate cancer. These findings provide insights into features associated with higher PRS, but larger multi-ancestral studies using PRS that are informative across populations are needed to understand its clinical utility."
38617512,CLCN3 in mediating the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Chloride channel-3 (CLCN3), a crucial component of the voltage-gated chloride channel family, is implicated in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of CLCN3 in pancancer and its influence on the immune response through the use of a range of databases. Concurrently, we assessed the impact of CLCN3 on the proliferation of ovarian cancer (OC) cells and explored its potential mechanisms. METHODS: We employed the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) databases to examine the messenger RNA (mRNA) and the protein expression of CLCN3 across various cancers. The prognostic significance of CLCN3 was evaluated using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2.0 (GEPIA 2.0) database. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN) facilitated the analysis of CLCN3 promoter methylation levels. The association between CLCN3 expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells was investigated using various algorithms. The cBioportal database facilitated the analysis of CLCN3 mutations and mutation sites across various cancers. The Tumor-Immune System Interactions Database (TISIDB) database was employed to explore the correlation between CLCN3 expression and immune or molecular subtypes across a variety of cancer types. We collected ovarian tissue samples, encompassing both normal ovarian and OC tissues. The human OC cell lines, SKOV3 cells and OVCAR433 cells, were cultured. CLCN3 expression was determined via reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), while phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase (PI3K/AKT) expression was detected using Western blot. We utilized small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to suppress CLCN3 expression. The proliferative capacity of SKOV3 and OVCAR433 cells was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. RESULTS: CLCN3 demonstrated an aberrant expression in a number of cancer types and was markedly reduced in OC tissues. Poor prognosis in cervical squamous cell cancer and myeloid leukemia was linked to excessive expression of CLCN3. The examination of immune cell infiltration, which included CD8(+) T cells, B cells, T regulatory cells, and cancer-associated fibroblast cells, showed a strong association with aberrant CLCN3 expression. Following the use of siRNA technology, the ability of the ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 and OVCAR433 to proliferate as well as the expression of PI3K/AKT both increased. CONCLUSIONS: CLCN3 is a possible biomarker for immune-related processes and the prognosis of cancer, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may affect OC cells' ability to proliferate."
38616205,Estimating the Prognostic Value of the NTRK Fusion Biomarker for Comparative Effectiveness Research in The Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the prognostic value of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions by comparing the survival of patients with NTRK+ tumours with patients without NTRK+ tumours. METHODS: We used genomic and clinical registry data from the Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment (CPCT-02) study containing a cohort of cancer patients who were treated in Dutch clinical practice between 2012 and 2020. We performed a propensity score matching analysis, where NTRK+ patients were matched to NTRK- patients in a 1:4 ratio. We subsequently analysed the survival of the matched sample of NTRK+ and NTRK- patients using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression, and performed an analysis of credibility to evaluate the plausibility of our result. RESULTS: Among 3556 patients from the CPCT-02 study with known tumour location, 24 NTRK+ patients were identified. NTRK+ patients were distributed across nine different tumour types: bone/soft tissue, breast, colorectal, head and neck, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin and urinary tract. NTRK fusions involving the NTRK3 gene (46%) and NTRK1 gene (33%) were most common. The survival analysis rendered a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.44 (95% CI 0.81-2.55) for NTRK+ patients. Using the point estimates of three prior studies on the prognostic value of NTRK fusions, our finding that the HR is > 1 was deemed plausible. CONCLUSIONS: NTRK+ patients may have an increased risk of death compared with NTRK- patients. When using historic control data to assess the comparative effectiveness of TRK inhibitors, the prognostic value of the NTRK fusion biomarker should therefore be accounted for."
38615287,Immune-related LncRNAs scores predicts chemotherapeutic responses and prognosis in cervical cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) regulating the immune microenvironment of cancer is a hot spot. But little is known about the influence of the immune-related lncRNA (IRlncRs) on the chemotherapeutic responses and prognosis of cervical cancer (CC) patients. The purpose of the study was to identify an immune-related lncRNAs (IRlncRs)-based model for the prospective prediction of clinical outcomes in CC patients. METHODS: CC patients' relevant data was acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Correlation analysis and Cox regression analyses were applied. A risk score formula was formulated. Prognostic factors were combined into a nomogram, while sensitivity for chemotherapy drugs was analyzed using the OncoPredict algorithm. RESULTS: Eight optimal IRlncRs(ATP2A1-AS1, LINC01943, AL158166.1, LINC00963, AC009065.8, LIPE-AS1, AC105277.1, AC098613.1.) were incorporated in the IRlncRs model. The overall survival (OS) of the high-risk group of the model was inferior to those in the low-risk group. Further analysis demonstrated this eight-IRlncRs model as a useful prognostic marker. The Nomogram had a concordance index of survival prediction of 0.763(95% CI 0.746-0.780) and more robust predictive accuracy. Furthermore, patients in the low-risk group were found to be more sensitive to chemotherapy, including Paclitaxel, Rapamycin, Epirubicin, Vincristine, Docetaxel and Vinorelbine. CONCLUSIONS: An eight-IRlncRs-based prediction model was identified that has the potential to be an important tool to predict chemotherapeutic responses and prognosis for CC patients."
38614920,Precision medicine for prostate cancer: An international perspective.,"Greater personalization of cancer medicine continues to shape therapy development and patient selection accordingly. The treatment of prostate cancer has evolved considerably since the discovery of androgen deprivation therapy. The comprehensive profiling of the prostate cancer genome has mapped the targetable molecular landscape of the disease and identified opportunities for the implementation of novel and combination therapies. In this review, we provide an overview of the molecular biology of prostate cancer and tools developed to aid prognostication and prediction of therapy benefit. Modern treatment of advanced prostate cancer is reviewed as a paradigm of increasing precision-informed approach to patient care, and must be considered on a global scale with respect to the state of science and care delivery."
38614420,Cancer risk and male Infertility: Unravelling predictive biomarkers and prognostic indicators.,"In recent years, there has been a global increase in cases of male infertility. There are about 30 million cases of male infertility worldwide and male reproductive health is showing rapid decline in last few decades. It is now recognized as a potential risk factor for developing certain types of cancer, particularly genitourinary malignancies like testicular and prostate cancer. Male infertility is considered a potential indicator of overall health and an early biomarker for cancer. Cases of unexplained male factor infertility have high levels of oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage and this induces both denovo germ line mutations and epimutations due to build up of 8-hydroxy 2 deoxygunaosine abase which is highly mutagenic and also induces hypomethylation and genomic instability. Consequently, there is growing evidence to explore the various factors contributing to an increased cancer risk. Currently, the available prognostic and predictive biomarkers associated with semen characteristics and cancer risk are limited but gaining significant attention in clinical research for the diagnosis and treatment of elevated cancer risk in the individual and in offspring. The male germ cell being transcriptionally and translationally inert has a highly truncated repair mechanism and has minimal antioxidants and thus most vulnerable to oxidative injury due to environmental factors and unhealthy lifestyle and social habits. Therefore, advancing our understanding requires a thorough evaluation of the pathophysiologic mechanisms at the DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite levels to identify key biomarkers that may underlie the pathogenesis of male infertility and associated cancer. Advanced methodologies such as genomics, epigenetics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics stand at the forefront of cutting-edge approaches for discovering novel biomarkers, spanning from infertility to associated cancer types. Henceforth, in this review, we aim to assess the role and potential of recently identified predictive and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into the success of assisted reproductive technologies, causes of azoospermia and idiopathic infertility, the impact of integrated holistic approach and lifestyle modifications, and the monitoring of cancer susceptibility, initiation and progression. Comprehending these biomarkers is crucial for providing comprehensive counselling to infertile men and cancer patients, along with their families."
38612439,Analysis of the Gene Networks and Pathways Correlated with Tissue Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent non-cutaneous cancer in men. Early PCa detection has been made possible by the adoption of screening methods based on the serum prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score (GS). The aim of this study was to correlate gene expression with the differentiation level of prostate adenocarcinomas, as indicated by GS. We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included 497 prostate cancer patients, 52 of which also had normal tissue sample sequencing data. Gene ontology analysis revealed that higher GSs were associated with greater responses to DNA damage, telomere lengthening, and cell division. Positive correlation was found with transcription factor activator of the adenovirus gene E2 (E2F) and avian myelocytomatosis viral homolog (MYC) targets, G2M checkpoints, DNA repair, and mitotic spindles. Immune cell deconvolution revealed high M0 macrophage counts and an increase in M2 macrophages dependent on the GS. The molecular pathways most correlated with GSs were cell cycle, RNA transport, and calcium signaling (depleted). A combinatorial approach identified a set of eight genes able to differentiate by k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) between normal tissues, low-Gleason tissues, and high-Gleason tissues with high accuracy. In conclusion, our study could be a step forward to better understanding the link between gene expression and PCa progression and aggressiveness."
38611599,Menstrual Blood as a Diagnostic Specimen for Human Papillomavirus Genotyping and Genital Tract Infection Using Next-Generation Sequencing as a Novel Diagnostic Tool.,"BACKGROUND: Menstrual blood (MB) is a convenient specimen type that can be self-collected easily and non-invasively by women. This study assessed the potential application of MB as a diagnostic specimen to detect genital tract infections (GTIs) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infections in women. METHOD: Genomic DNA was extracted from MB samples. Pacific Bioscience (Pacbio) 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read sequencing and HPV PCR were performed. RESULTS: MB samples were collected from women with a pathological diagnosis of CIN1, CIN2, CIN3 or HPV infection. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of high-risk HPV detection using MB were found to be 66.7%. A shift in vaginal flora and a significant depletion in Lactobacillus spp. in the vaginal microbiota communities were observed in the MB samples using 16S rDNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that MB is a proper diagnostic specimen of consideration for non-invasive detection of HPV DNA and genotyping using PCR and the diagnosis of GTIs using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). MB testing is suitable for all women who menstruate and this study has opened up the possibility of the use of MB as a diagnostic specimen to maintain women's health."
38611064,Evaluating Leukocyte Telomere Length and Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells as Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are associated with aging and the development and progression of cancer. However, the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the potential of LTL and MDSC as diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer while also seeking to deepen our understanding of the relationship of these potential biomarkers to each other. METHODS: Our study involved patients undergoing a prostate biopsy. We analyzed the relative LTL in genomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood leukocytes as well as the percentage of MDSC and their subtypes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Our evaluation focused on examining the relationship between LTL and MDSC and pathological diagnoses as well as investigating the correlation between LTL and MDSC levels. RESULTS: In our study of 102 participants, 56 were pathologically diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (cancer group), while 46 tested negative (control group). The cancer group exhibited significantly shorter LTL in comparison to the control group (p = 0.024). Additionally, the cancer group showed a tendency towards a higher percentage of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.056). Our multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with shorter LTL and higher percentages of M-MDSC had a 2.98-fold (95% CI = 1.001-8.869, p = 0.049) and 3.03-fold (95% CI = 1.152-7.977, p = 0.025) increased risk of prostate cancer diagnosis, respectively. There was also a significant negative correlation between LTL and M-MDSC. (r = -0.347, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our research has established a correlation between LTL and MDSC in patients undergoing biopsy for prostate cancer. Notably, we observed that individuals with localized prostate cancer tend to have shorter LTL and a higher percentage of M-MDSC prior to their diagnosis. These findings suggest that LTL and M-MDSC could potentially serve as adjunctive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer."
38611001,Clinical Validation of the Vitro HPV Screening Assay for Its Use in Primary Cervical Cancer Screening.,"Many scientific societies have issued guidelines to introduce population-based cervical cancer screening with HPV testing. The Vitro HPV Screening assay is a fully automatic multiplex real-time PCR test targeting the L1 GP5+/GP6+ region of HPV genome. The assay detects 14 high risk (HR) HPV genotypes, identifying individual HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes, and the HPV-positive samples for the other 12 HR HPV types are subsequently genotyped with the HPV Direct Flow Chip test. Following international guidelines, the aim of this study was to validate the clinical accuracy of the Vitro HPV Screening test on ThinPrep-collected samples for its use as primary cervical cancer screening, using as comparator the validated cobas((R)) 4800 HPV test. The non-inferiority analysis showed that the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Vitro HPV Screening assay for a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were not inferior to those of cobas((R)) 4800 HPV (p = 0.0049 and p < 0.001 respectively). The assay has demonstrated a high intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility, also among the individual genotypes. The Vitro HPV Screening assay is valid for cervical cancer screening and it provides genotyping information on HPV-positive samples without further sample processing in a fully automated workflow."
38610981,RNA m6a Methylation Regulator Expression in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression and Its Genetic Associations.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, a prevalent epitranscriptomic modification, plays a crucial role in regulating mRNA expression, stability, and translation in mammals. M6A regulators have gained attention for their potential implications in tumorigenesis and clinical applications, such as cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The existing literature predominantly addresses m6A regulators in the context of primary prostate cancer (PCa). However, a notable gap in the knowledge emerges regarding the dynamic expression patterns of these regulators as PCa progresses towards the castration-resistant stage (CRPC). Employing sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) and RNAseq analysis, we comprehensively profiled the expression of 27 m6A regulators in hormone/androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cell lines, revealing distinct clustering between tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissues. High-grade PCa tumors demonstrated the upregulation of METTL3, RBM15B, and HNRNAPA2B1 and the downregulation of ZC3H13, NUDT21, and FTO. Notably, we identified six m6A regulators associated with PCa survival. Additionally, association analysis of the PCa-associated risk loci in the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) data unveiled genetic variations near the WTAP, HNRNPA2B1, and FTO genes as significant expression quantitative trait loci. In summary, our study unraveled abnormalities in m6A regulator expression in PCa progression, elucidating their association with PCa risk loci. Considering the heterogeneity within the PCa phenotypes and treatment responses, our findings suggest that prognostic stratification based on m6A regulator expression could enhance PCa diagnosis and prognosis."
38610926,Prognostic Significance of the Cribriform Pattern in Prostate Cancer: Clinical Outcomes and Genomic Alterations.,"PURPOSE: Given the diverse clinical progression of prostate cancer (PC) and the evolving significance of histopathological factors in its management, this study aimed to explore the impact of cribriform pattern 4 (CP4) on clinical outcomes in PC patients and examine its molecular characteristics. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and included PC patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and had pathology slides available for the assessment of CP4. A multivariable competing risk regression analysis was used to assess the association between CP4 and progression-free survival (PFS) while adjusting for established PC prognostic factors. The frequency of genomic alterations was compared between patients with and without CP4 using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among the 394 patients analyzed, 129 (32.74%) had CP4. After a median follow-up of 40.50 months (IQR: 23.90, 65.60), the presence of CP4 was significantly associated with lower PFS (AHR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.114; p = 0.023) after adjusting for covariates. Seven hub genes-KRT13, KRT5, KRT15, COL17A1, KRT14, KRT16, and TP63-had significantly lower mRNA expression levels in patients with CP4 compared to those without. CONCLUSIONS: PC patients with CP4 have distinct genomic alterations and are at a high risk of disease progression following RP. Therefore, these patients may benefit from additional post-RP treatments and should be the subject of a prospective randomized clinical trial."
38609663,A combination of cuproptosis and lncRNAs predicts the prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis induces proteotoxic stress and eventually leads to cell death. However, the relationship between cuproptosis and lncRNAs in cervical cancer has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we aim to explore the association among lncRNAs, cuproptosis and clinical features in cervical cancer. METHODS: RNA sequencing, genetic mutations, and clinical data of CESC patients were obtained from TCGA. Cuproptosis-associated genes were gathered. WGCNA was used to cluster important modules, and KEGG, GO, GSEA and GSVA were used to explore functional and pathway enrichment. The association between immune microenvironment and cuproptosis-related lncRNAs was performed by using cibersort algorithm and other platforms, including XCELL, TIMER, QUANTISEQ, MCPCOUNTER and EPIC. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was employed to detect the expression of LINC01833 and LINC02321, and CCK-8 and cell scratch assays were used to assess cell proliferation and migration capabilities after LINCRNA interference. RESULTS: 202 upregulated and 45 downregulated lncRNAs were selected. The survival analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference in survival rates between the high-risk and low-risk groups. The prognosis of tumour mutation burden and the degree of immune infiltration were differed noticeably between the high-risk and low-risk groups. BHG712, TL-2-105, FR-180204, Masitinib, TAK-715, ODI-027, JW-7-24-2, and OSI-930 had substantially higher IC50 values in the high-risk group. Notably, we found AL360178.1 was associated with RNF44 E3 ubiquitin ligase expression. In cervical cancer cell lines, LINC01833 and LINC02321 displayed significant upregulation. Efficient siRNA transfection led to a decreased expression of LINC01833 and LINC02321. This knockdown significantly hindered both cell proliferation and migration capabilities in cervical cancer cells compared to the negative control. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we constructed five cuprotosis-related lncRNA prognostic models, which may be new tumor therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer."
38609177,"Pathogenic variant detection rate varies considerably in male breast cancer families and sporadic cases: minimal additional contribution beyond BRCA2, BRCA1 and CHEK2.","BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) affects around 1 in 1000 men and is known to have a higher underlying component of high and moderate risk gene pathogenic variants (PVs) than female breast cancer, particularly in BRCA2. However, most studies only report overall detection rates without assessing detailed family history. METHODS: We reviewed germline testing in 204 families including at least one MBC for BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 c.1100DelC and an extended panel in 93 of these families. Individuals had MBC (n=118), female breast cancer (FBC)(n=80), ovarian cancer (n=3) or prostate cancer-(n=3). Prior probability of having a BRCA1/2 PV was assessed using the Manchester Scoring System (MSS). RESULTS: In the 204 families, BRCA2 was the major contributor, with 51 (25%) having PVs, followed by BRCA1 and CHEK2, with five each (2.45%) but no additional PVs identified, including in families with high genetic likelihood on MSS. Detection rates were 85.7% (12/14) in MSS >/=40 and 65.5% with MSS 30-39 but only 12.8% (6/47) for sporadic breast cancer. PV rates were low and divided equally between BRCA1/2 and CHEK2. CONCLUSION: As expected, BRCA2 PVs predominate in MBC families with rates 10-fold those in CHEK2 and BRCA1. The MSS is an effective tool in assessing the likelihood of BRCA1/2 PVs."
38608913,Prognostic and therapeutic potential of STAT3: Opportunities and challenges in targeting HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis.,"Cervical cancer (CaCx) ranks as the fourth most prevalent cancer among women globally. Persistent infection of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) is major etiological factor associated with CaCx. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), a prominent member of the STAT family, has emerged as independent oncogenic driver. It is a target of many oncogenic viruses including HPV. How STAT3 influences HPV viral gene expression or gets affected by HPV is an area of active investigation. A better understanding of host-virus interaction will provide a prognostic and therapeutic window for CaCx control and management. In this comprehensive review, we delve into carcinogenic role of STAT3 in development of HPV-induced CaCx. With an emphasis on fascinating interplay between STAT3 and HPV genome, the review explores the diverse array of opportunities and challenges associated with this field to harness the prognostic and therapeutic potential of STAT3 in CaCx."
38608077,Deciphering age-specific molecular features in cervical cancer and constructing an angio-immune prognostic model.,"Cancer incidence is increasingly seen in younger individuals. Molecular distinctions between young and elderly patients at onset are understudied. This study used public databases to explore genomic, transcriptomic, and immune-related features across age groups in cervical cancer. Additionally, it aims to create a prognostic model applicable across diverse age cohorts, enabling precise patient stratification, and personalized therapies. Gene mutations, expression data, and clinicopathological information were obtained from 317 cervical cancer patients. These patients were divided into a young group and an old group based on the median age of onset. The characteristics of differential gene mutation, gene expression, and immune cells analysis were analyzed by R software. Finally, the prognostic model was constructed by univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and multivariate Cox regression analyses of angiogenic and immune gene sets. Its validity was further confirmed using an additional 300 cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma tissues. Cervical cancer patients at elderly onset age exhibit a significantly higher frequency of NOTCH1 and TP53 driver mutations compared to young patients, along with a notably higher tumor mutational burden. However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of genomic instability and age-related mutational signatures. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the young group significantly upregulated interferon-alpha and gamma responses and exhibited significantly higher activity in multiple metabolic pathways. Immune microenvironment analysis indicated enrichment of dendritic cells and natural killer cells in the young group, while transforming growth factor-beta signature was enriched in the elderly group, indicating a higher degree of immune exclusion. A multigene prognostic model based on angiogenesis and T cell immune gene sets showed excellent prognostic performance independent of clinical factors such as age. High-risk groups identified by the model exhibit significant activation of tumor-promoting processes, such as metastasis and angiogenesis. Our study reveals distinct patterns in cancer-driving mechanisms, biological processes, and immune system status between young and elderly patients at onset with cervical cancer. These findings shed light on the age-specific underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, an independent molecular prognostic model is constructed to provide valuable references for patient stratification and the development of potential drug targets."
38606643,Hierarchical joint analysis of marginal summary statistics-Part I: Multipopulation fine mapping and credible set construction.,"Recent advancement in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comes from not only increasingly larger sample sizes but also the shift in focus towards underrepresented populations. Multipopulation GWAS increase power to detect novel risk variants and improve fine-mapping resolution by leveraging evidence and differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) from diverse populations. Here, we expand upon our previous approach for single-population fine-mapping through Joint Analysis of Marginal SNP Effects (JAM) to a multipopulation analysis (mJAM). Under the assumption that true causal variants are common across studies, we implement a hierarchical model framework that conditions on multiple SNPs while explicitly incorporating the different LD structures across populations. The mJAM framework can be used to first select index variants using the mJAM likelihood with different feature selection approaches. In addition, we present a novel approach leveraging the ideas of mediation to construct credible sets for these index variants. Construction of such credible sets can be performed given any existing index variants. We illustrate the implementation of the mJAM likelihood through two implementations: mJAM-SuSiE (a Bayesian approach) and mJAM-Forward selection. Through simulation studies based on realistic effect sizes and levels of LD, we demonstrated that mJAM performs well for constructing concise credible sets that include the underlying causal variants. In real data examples taken from the most recent multipopulation prostate cancer GWAS, we showed several practical advantages of mJAM over other existing multipopulation methods."
38606616,Enhanced prostatic Esr1(+) luminal epithelial cells in the absence of SRD5A2.,"Steroid 5alpha reductase 2 (SRD5A2) converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and is crucial for prostatic development. 5alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI) reduce prostate size in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and ameliorate lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH. However, the mechanisms of 5ARI functioning are still not fully understood. Here, we used a Srd5a2(-/-) mouse model and employed single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the impact of SRD5A2 absence on prostate cellular heterogeneity. Significant alterations in luminal epithelial cell (LE) populations were observed, alongside an increased proportion and proliferative phenotype of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)(+) LE2 cells, following an SRD5A2-independent ESR1 differentiation trajectory. LE2 cells exhibited enhanced estrogen response gene signatures, suggesting an alternative pathway for prostate growth when SRD5A2 is absent. Human prostate biopsy analysis revealed an inverse correlation between the expressions of SRD5A2 and LE2 markers (ESR1/PKCalpha), and an inverse correlation between SRD5A2 and the clinical efficiency of 5ARI. These findings provide insights into 5ARI resistance mechanisms and potential alternative therapies for BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms.

38606479,Prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness and worsens prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.,"Approximately 20% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are first diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) because they develop symptoms at an advanced stage. Despite advancements in treatment, patients with metastatic disease still experience inferior survival rates. Our objective is to investigate the association between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and prognosis and to explore their role in mCRC. In this study, we find that elevated expression of PCAT6 is independently linked to unfavourable survival outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, and this finding is further confirmed in CRC samples obtained from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Cell lines and xenograft mouse models are used to examine the impact of PCAT6 on tumor metastasis. Knockdown of PCAT6 is observed to impede the metastatic phenotype of CRC, as evidenced by functional assays, demonstrating the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. Our findings show the significance of PCAT6 in mCRC and its potential use as a prognostic biomarker."
38605607,Manzamine A reduces androgen receptor transcription and synthesis by blocking E2F8-DNA interactions and effectively inhibits prostate tumor growth in mice.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is the main driver in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer, where the emergence of AR splice variants leads to treatment-resistant disease. Through detailed molecular studies of the marine alkaloid manzamine A (MA), we identified transcription factor E2F8 as a previously unknown regulator of AR transcription that prevents AR synthesis in prostate cancer cells. MA significantly inhibited the growth of various prostate cancer cell lines and was highly effective in inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in mice without any pathophysiological perturbations in major organs. MA suppressed the full-length AR (AR-FL), its spliced variant AR-V7, and the AR-regulated prostate-specific antigen (PSA; also known as KLK3) and human kallikrein 2 (hK2; also known as KLK2) genes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and protein modeling studies revealed E2F8 interactions with DNA as a potential novel target of MA, suppressing AR transcription and its synthesis. This novel mechanism of blocking AR biogenesis via E2F8 may provide an opportunity to control therapy-resistant prostate cancer over the currently used AR antagonists designed to target different parts of the AR gene."
38605399,"The implications of single-cell RNA-seq analysis in prostate cancer: unraveling tumor heterogeneity, therapeutic implications and pathways towards personalized therapy.","In recent years, advancements in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, which are highly regarded developments in the current era, particularly the emerging integration of single-cell and spatiotemporal transcriptomics, have enabled a detailed molecular comprehension of the complex regulation of cell fate. The insights obtained from these methodologies are anticipated to significantly contribute to the development of personalized medicine. Currently, single-cell technology is less frequently utilized for prostate cancer compared with other types of tumors. Starting from the perspective of RNA sequencing technology, this review outlined the significance of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in prostate cancer research, encompassing preclinical medicine and clinical applications. We summarize the differences between mouse and human prostate cancer as revealed by scRNA-seq studies, as well as a combination of multi-omics methods involving scRNA-seq to highlight the key molecular targets for the diagnosis, treatment, and drug resistance characteristics of prostate cancer. These studies are expected to provide novel insights for the development of immunotherapy and other innovative treatment strategies for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, we explore the potential clinical applications stemming from other single-cell technologies in this review, paving the way for future research in precision medicine."
38602643,Explainable and visualizable machine learning models to predict biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: Machine learning (ML) models presented an excellent performance in the prognosis prediction. However, the black box characteristic of ML models limited the clinical applications. Here, we aimed to establish explainable and visualizable ML models to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 647 PCa patients were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical parameters were identified using LASSO regression. Then, cohort was split into training and validation datasets with a ratio of 0.75:0.25 and BCR-related features were included in Cox regression and five ML algorithm to construct BCR prediction models. The clinical utility of each model was evaluated by concordance index (C-index) values and decision curve analyses (DCA). Besides, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values were used to explain the features in the models. RESULTS: We identified 11 BCR-related features using LASSO regression, then establishing five ML-based models, including random survival forest (RSF), survival support vector machine (SSVM), survival Tree (sTree), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a Cox regression model, C-index were 0.846 (95%CI 0.796-0.894), 0.774 (95%CI 0.712-0.834), 0.757 (95%CI 0.694-0.818), 0.820 (95%CI 0.765-0.869), 0.793 (95%CI 0.735-0.852), and 0.807 (95%CI 0.753-0.858), respectively. The DCA showed that RSF model had significant advantages over all models. In interpretability of ML models, the SHAP value demonstrated the tangible contribution of each feature in RSF model. CONCLUSIONS: Our score system provide reference for the identification for BCR, and the crafting of a framework for making therapeutic decisions for PCa on a personalized basis."
38602058,Exploring the tumor genomic landscape of aggressive prostate cancer by whole-genome sequencing of tissue or liquid biopsies.,"Treatment resistance remains a major issue in aggressive prostate cancer (PC), and novel genomic biomarkers may guide better treatment selection. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can provide minimally invasive information about tumor genomes, but the genomic landscape of aggressive PC based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ctDNA remains incompletely characterized. Thus, we here performed WGS of tumor tissue (n = 31) or plasma ctDNA (n = 10) from a total of 41 aggressive PC patients, including 11 hormone-naive, 15 hormone-sensitive, and 15 castration-resistant patients. Across all variant types, we found progressively more altered tumor genomic profiles in later stages of aggressive PC. The potential driver genes most frequently affected by single-nucleotide variants or insertions/deletions included the known PC-related genes TP53, CDK12, and PTEN and the novel genes COL13A1, KCNH3, and SENP3. Etiologically, aggressive PC was associated with age-related and DNA repair-related mutational signatures. Copy number variants most frequently affected 14q11.2 and 8p21.2, where no well-recognized PC-related genes are located, and also frequently affected regions near the known PC-related genes MYC, AR, TP53, PTEN, and BRCA1. Structural variants most frequently involved not only the known PC-related genes TMPRSS2 and ERG but also the less extensively studied gene in this context, PTPRD. Finally, clinically actionable variants were detected throughout all stages of aggressive PC and in both plasma and tissue samples, emphasizing the potential clinical applicability of WGS of minimally invasive plasma samples. Overall, our study highlights the feasibility of using liquid biopsies for comprehensive genomic characterization as an alternative to tissue biopsies in advanced/aggressive PC."
38598641,Impact of Family History and Germline Genetic Risk Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on Long-Term Outcomes of Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Family history and germline genetic risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been separately shown to stratify lifetime risk of prostate cancer. Here, we evaluate the combined prognostic value of family history of prostate and other related cancers and germline risk SNPs among patients with favorable-risk prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1367 participants from the prospective Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with low- or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 1986 to 2017 underwent genome-wide SNP genotyping. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the association between family history, specific germline risk variants, and a 269 SNP polygenic risk score with prostate cancer‒specific death. RESULTS: Family history of prostate, breast, and/or pancreatic cancer was observed in 489 (36%) participants. With median follow-up from diagnosis of 14.9 years, participants with favorable-risk prostate cancer with a positive family history had a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer‒specific death (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.15-3.32, P = .014) compared to those without any family history. The rs2735839 (19q13) risk allele was associated with prostate cancer‒specific death (HR 1.81 per risk allele, 95% CI 1.04-3.17, P = .037), whereas the polygenic risk score was not. Combined family history and rs2735839 risk allele were each associated with an additive risk of prostate cancer‒specific death (HR 1.78 per risk factor, 95% CI 1.25-2.53, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Family history of prostate, breast, or pancreatic cancer and/or a 19q13 germline risk allele are associated with an elevated risk of prostate cancer‒specific death among favorable-risk patients. These findings have implications for how family history and germline genetic risk SNPs should be factored into clinical decision-making around favorable-risk prostate cancer."
38598551,Benchmarking multi-ancestry prostate cancer polygenic risk scores in a real-world cohort.,"Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) offer promising advancements in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. While their accuracy continues to improve, research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness within African and Asian populations remains key for equitable use. Recent algorithmic developments for PRS derivation have resulted in improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. In this study, we benchmark the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four of which adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts."
38598542,Interference with mitochondrial metabolism could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer.,"Metabolic reprogramming has been defined as a hallmark of malignancies. Prior studies have focused on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of POLG2 gene, which is reportedly responsible for encoding mitochondrial DNA genes and is implicated in the material and energy metabolism of tumor cells, whereas its function in prostate cancer has been elusive. Gene expression profile matrix and clinical information were downloaded from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data portal, and GSE3325 and GSE8511 were retrieved from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. We conducted analysis of the relative expression of POLG2, clinical characterization, survival analysis, GO / KEGG and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) enrichment analysis in R and employed STRING portal to acquaint ourselves with the protein-protein interaction (PPI). IHC (Immunohistochemical) profiles of POLG2 protein between normal and cancerous tissues were consulted via HPA (Human protein atlas) database and the immunohistochemical POLG2 were verified between para-cancerous and cancerous tissues in tissue array. At the cellular level, Mitochondrial dysfunction assay, DNA synthesis test, wound healing assay, and invasion assay were implemented to further validate the phenotype of POLG2 knockdown in PCa cell lines. RT-qPCR and western blotting were routinely adopted to verify variations of molecular expression within epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Results showed that POLG2 was over-expressed in most cancer types, and the over-expression of POLG2 was correlated with PCa progression and suggested poor OS (Overall Survival) and PFI (Progress Free Interval). Multivariate analysis showed that POLG2 might be an independent prognostic factor of prostate cancer. We also performed GO/KEGG, GSEA analysis, co-expression genes, and PPI, and observed the metabolism-related gene alterations in PCa. Furthermore, we verified that POLG2 knockdown had an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial function, proliferation, cell motility, and invasion, we affirmed POLG2 could affect the prognosis of advanced prostate cancer via EMT. In summary, our findings indicate that over-expressed POLG2 renders poor prognosis in advanced prostate cancer. This disadvantageous factor can serve as a potential indicator, making it possible to target mitochondrial metabolism to treat advanced prostate cancer."
38596305,CRISPR editing to mimic porphyria combined with light: A new preclinical approach for prostate cancer.,"Thanks to its very high genome-editing efficiency, CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be a promising anticancer weapon. Clinical trials using CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease to ex vivo edit and alter immune cells are ongoing. However, to date, this strategy still has not been applied in clinical practice to directly target cancer cells. Targeting a canonical metabolic pathway essential to good functioning of cells without potential escape would represent an attractive strategy. We propose to mimic a genetic metabolic disorder in cancer cells to weaken cancer cells, independent of their genomic abnormalities. Mutations affecting the heme biosynthesis pathway are responsible for porphyria, and most of them are characterized by an accumulation of toxic photoreactive porphyrins. This study aimed to mimic porphyria by using CRISPR-Cas9 to inactivate UROS, leading to porphyrin accumulation in a prostate cancer model. Prostate cancer is the leading cancer in men and has a high mortality rate despite therapeutic progress, with a primary tumor accessible to light. By combining light with gene therapy, we obtained high efficiency in vitro and in vivo, with considerable improvement in the survival of mice. Finally, we achieved the preclinical proof-of-principle of performing cancer CRISPR gene therapy."
38594602,Estrogen receptors alpha and beta expression in different canine cancer types with an emphasis on hematopoietic malignancies.,"Estrogen receptors (ERs) are located in both healthy and neoplastic tissues. The type of estrogen receptor expressed varies depending on its location, tumor type, and species. Estrogen action is mediated by binding to ER and activating the transcriptional and signaling processes that result in the control of gene expression. There are two main types of estrogen receptors: ER alpha (ERalpha) and ER beta (ERbeta). Both receptors are functionally different, they may act antagonistically and are distributed in different tissues but their structure is similar - as they are composed of 5 different domains: A/B, C, D, E, and F. The signaling pathway and hence regulation of the gene expression by ERs is a complex and multifactorial process that involves both genomic and nongenomic actions. In the human reproductive tract, both ERalpha and beta are present, with predominant expression of ERbeta, while there are no satisfactory data distinguishing the type of ERs expressed in the canine reproductive tract. In mammary gland neoplasia, a decreased or lacking ERalpha expression in humans is associated with a poorer prognosis. This is similar to dogs, where higher ERalpha expression intensity was noted in benign tumors than in carcinomas. In human hematopoietic malignancies, ERbeta is a predominant receptor. Selective and non-selective ERbeta agonists have an antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect on human lymphoma cell lines and may be effective in the therapy of ERbeta positive lymphomas and leukemias. In canine lymphoma tissues, none or only marginal expression of ERs was detected over the decades. Considering available data, we conducted preliminary studies proving that, in contrast to humans, the dominant ER expressed in canine hematopoietic tumors is ERalpha."
38594418,A genome-wide association study provides insights into the genetic etiology of 57 essential and non-essential trace elements in humans.,"Trace elements are important for human health but may exert toxic or adverse effects. Mechanisms of uptake, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are partly under genetic control but have not yet been extensively mapped. Here we report a comprehensive multi-element genome-wide association study of 57 essential and non-essential trace elements. We perform genome-wide association meta-analyses of 14 trace elements in up to 6564 Scandinavian whole blood samples, and genome-wide association studies of 43 trace elements in up to 2819 samples measured only in the Trondelag Health Study (HUNT). We identify 11 novel genetic loci associated with blood concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, manganese, selenium, and zinc in genome-wide association meta-analyses. In HUNT, several genome-wide significant loci are also indicated for other trace elements. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization, we find several indications of weak to moderate effects on health outcomes, the most precise being a weak harmful effect of increased zinc on prostate cancer. However, independent validation is needed. Our current understanding of trace element-associated genetic variants may help establish consequences of trace elements on human health."
38593211,From morphology to methylome: epigenetic studies of Mullerian mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma reveal similarities to cervical mesonephric adenocarcinoma(dagger).,"Mesonephric adenocarcinomas (MAs) and mesonephric-like adenocarcinomas (MLAs) are rare, aggressive neoplasms that arise in the gynecologic tract and show overlapping morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features. While MAs occur in the cervix and are thought to arise from mesonephric remnants, MLAs occur in the endometrium and ovary and are believed to originate from transdifferentiation of Mullerian lesions. Both MAs and MLAs show a variety of architectural patterns, exhibit frequent expression of GATA3 by immunohistochemistry, and harbor KRAS mutations. In a recent article published in The Journal of Pathology, Kommoss and colleagues used DNA methylation profiling to extend these similarities and showed that MLAs and MAs cluster together based on their epigenetic signatures and are epigenetically distinct from other Mullerian adenocarcinomas. They also showed that MLAs and MAs harbor a high number of global copy number alterations. This study provides evidence that MLAs more closely resemble MAs than Mullerian carcinomas on an epigenetic level. As a result, the authors argue that MLA should be renamed 'mesonephric-type adenocarcinoma.' Further research is needed to establish the relationship between these two entities, their etiology, and pathogenesis. (c) 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."
38593055,Evaluation of miR-130b-3p and miR-375 levels and telomere length with telomerase activity in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequent cancer in males, as well as the second highest cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Differences in expression levels of miRNAs were linked with prostat cancer pathogenesis. qPCR was used to evaluate the expression of miR-130b-3p and miR-375 in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH (n = 20) and PC (n = 22, pre- and post-operative) patients plasma. Relative telomere lengths (RLTs) in genomic DNA isolated from plasma were measured with qPCR, and telomerase activity analyzed by the ELISA method. PSA levels of PC patients were greater than of BPH patients (p = 0.0473). miR-130b-3p and miR-375 levels were significantly lower in pre-operative specimens of PC patients according to BPH (p = 0,0362, p = 0.0168, respectively). Similarly, post-operative miR-375 levels were lower in PC patients than in BPH patients (p = 0.1866). BPH patients had shorter RTLs than PC patients in both pre- (p=0.0438) and post-operative (p=0.0297) specimens. Telomerase activity was higher in PC patients than BPH(p = 0.0129). Interestingly, telomerase activity was further increased after surgery (p = 0.0003). We aim to identify the levels of miR-130b-3p and miR-375 expression and their relationship with telomerase activity in PC patients. Our data suggest that miRNAs and telomere length (TL) with telomerase activity may play a role in regulating prostate tumorgenesis and may be used as biomarkers for PC diagnosis."
38591246,"Pepticinnamins N, O, and P, Nonribosomal Peptides from the Soil-Derived Streptomyces mirabilis P8-A2.","Cinnamoyl moiety containing nonribosomal peptides represented by pepticinnamin E are a growing family of natural products isolated from different Streptomyces species and possess diverse bioactivities. The soil bacterium Streptomyces mirabilis P8-A2 harbors a cryptic pepticinnamin biosynthetic gene cluster, producing azodyrecins as major products. Inactivation of the azodyrecin biosynthetic gene cluster by CRISPR-BEST base editing led to the activation and production of pepticinnamin E (1) and its analogues, pepticinnamins N, O, and P (2-4), the structures of which were determined by detailed NMR spectroscopy, HRMS data, and Marfey's reactions. These new compounds did not show a growth inhibitory effect against the LNCaP and C4-2B prostate cancer lines, respectively."
38590132,Proteomic Identification of Small Extracellular Vesicle Proteins LAMB1 and Histone H4 for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Risk Stratification.,"Diagnosis and stratification of prostate cancer (PCa) patients using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is challenging. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a new star of liquid biopsy, has attracted interest to complement inaccurate PSA screening and invasiveness of tissue biopsy. In this study, a panel of potential small EV (sEV) protein biomarkers is identified from PCa cell lines using label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics. These biomarkers underwent further validation with plasma and urine samples from different PCa stages through parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted proteomics, western blotting, and ELISA. Additionally, a tissue microarray containing cancerous and noncancerous tissues is screened to provide additional evidence of selected sEV proteins associated with cancer origin. Results indicate that sEV protein LAMB1 is highly expressed in human plasma of metastatic PCa patients compared with localised PCa patients and control subjects, while sEV protein Histone H4 is highly expressed in human urine of high-risk PCa patients compared to low-risk PCa patients and control subjects. These two sEV proteins demonstrate higher specificity and sensitivity than the PSA test and show promise for metastatic PCa diagnosis, progression monitoring, and risk stratification."
38589664,Mutational signature-based identification of DNA repair deficient gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas for therapeutic targeting.,"Homologous recombination (HR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) are the two most frequently disabled DNA repair pathways in cancer. HR-deficient breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers respond well to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. However, the frequency of HR deficiency in gastric and esophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) still lacks diagnostic and functional validation. Using whole exome and genome sequencing data, we found that a significant subset of GEA, but very few colorectal adenocarcinomas, show evidence of HR deficiency by mutational signature analysis (HRD score). High HRD gastric cancer cell lines demonstrated functional HR deficiency by RAD51 foci assay and increased sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. Of clinical relevance, analysis of three different GEA patient cohorts demonstrated that platinum treated HR deficient cancers had better outcomes. A gastric cancer cell line with strong sensitivity to cisplatin showed HR proficiency but exhibited NER deficiency by two photoproduct repair assays. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that, in addition to inducing apoptosis, cisplatin treatment triggered ferroptosis in a NER-deficient gastric cancer, validated by intracellular GSH assay. Overall, our study provides preclinical evidence that a subset of GEAs harbor genomic features of HR and NER deficiency and may therefore benefit from platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors."
38588883,Somatic Tumor Testing in Prostate Cancer: Experience of a Tertiary Care Center Including Pathologist-Driven Reflex Testing of Localized Tumors at Diagnosis.,"Somatic tumor testing in prostate cancer (PCa) can guide treatment options by identifying clinically actionable variants in DNA damage repair genes, including acquired variants not detected using germline testing alone. Guidelines currently recommend performing somatic tumor testing in metastatic PCa, whereas there is no consensus on the role of testing in regional disease, and the optimal testing strategy is only evolving. This study evaluates the frequency, distribution, and pathologic correlates of somatic DNA damage repair mutations in metastatic and localized PCa following the implementation of pathologist-driven reflex testing at diagnosis. A cohort of 516 PCa samples were sequenced using a custom next-generation sequencing panel including homologous recombination repair and mismatch repair genes. Variants were classified based on the Association for Molecular Pathology/American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines. In total, 183 (35.5%) patients had at least one variant, which is as follows: 72 of 516 (13.9%) patients had at least 1 tier I or tier II variant, whereas 111 of 516 (21.5%) patients had a tier III variant. Tier I/II variant(s) were identified in 27% (12/44) of metastatic biopsy samples and 13% (61/472) of primary samples. Overall, 12% (62/516) of patients had at least 1 tier I/II variant in a homologous recombination repair gene, whereas 2.9% (10/516) had at least 1 tier I/II variant in a mismatch repair gene. The presence of a tier I/II variant was not significantly associated with the grade group (GG) or presence of intraductal/cribriform carcinoma in the primary tumor. Among the 309 reflex-tested hormone-naive primary tumors, tier I/II variants were identified in 10% (31/309) of cases, which is as follows: 9.2% (9/98) GG2; 9% (9/100) GG3; 9.1% (4/44) GG4; and 13.4% (9/67) GG5 cases. Our findings confirm the use of somatic tumor testing in detecting variants of clinical significance in PCa and provide insights that can inform the design of testing strategies. Pathologist-initiated reflex testing streamlines the availability of the results for clinical decision-making; however, pathologic parameters such as GG and the presence of intraductal/cribriform carcinoma may not be reliable to guide patient selection."
38588411,Ketogenic Diet Alters the Epigenetic and Immune Landscape of Prostate Cancer to Overcome Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy.,"Resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy represents a formidable clinical challenge limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. In particular, prostate cancer poses a challenge for ICB therapy due to its immunosuppressive features. A ketogenic diet (KD) has been reported to enhance response to ICB therapy in some other cancer models. However, adverse effects associated with continuous KD were also observed, demanding better mechanistic understanding and optimized regimens for using KD as an immunotherapy sensitizer. In this study, we established a series of ICB-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and developed a highly effective strategy of combining anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat, a cyclic KD (CKD), or dietary supplementation of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which is an endogenous HDACi. CKD and BHB supplementation each delayed prostate cancer tumor growth as monotherapy, and both BHB and adaptive immunity were required for the antitumor activity of CKD. Single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that HDACi and ketogenesis enhanced ICB efficacy through both cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms, including upregulation of MHC class I molecules, and -extrinsic mechanisms, such as CD8+ T-cell chemoattraction, M1/M2 macrophage rebalancing, monocyte differentiation toward antigen-presenting cells, and diminished neutrophil infiltration. Overall, these findings illuminate a potential clinical path of using HDACi and optimized KD regimens to enhance ICB therapy for prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Optimized cyclic ketogenic diet and 1,3-butanediol supplementation regimens enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in prostate cancer through epigenetic and immune modulations, providing dietary interventions to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy."
38585988,Urinary extracellular vesicle-derived miR-126-3p predicts lymph node invasion in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.,"To investigate extracellular vesicles (EVs) biomarkers for predicting lymph node invasion (LNI) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HRPCa), plasma and/or urine samples were prospectively collected from 45 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and five with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Small RNA sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs in the EVs. All patients with PCa underwent radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Differentially-expressed miRNAs were identified in patients with and without pathologically-verified LNI. The candidate miRNAs were validated in low-risk prostate cancer (LRPCa) and BPH. Four miRNA species (e.g. miR-126-3p) and three miRNA species (e.g. miR-27a-3p) were more abundant in urinary and plasma EVs, respectively, of patients with PCa. None of these miRNA species were shared between urinary and plasma EVs. miR-126-3p was significantly more abundant in patients with HR PCa with LNI than in those without (P = 0.018). miR-126-3p was significantly more abundant in the urinary EVs of patients with HRPCa than in those with LRPCa (P = 0.017) and BPH (P = 0.011). In conclusion, urinary EVs-derived miR-126-3p may serve as a good biomarker for predicting LNI in patients with HRPCa."
38585005,Prognostic utility of biopsy-based PTEN and ERG status on biochemical progression and overall survival after SBRT for localized prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) genomic deletions and transmembrane protease, serine 2/v-ets avian erthyroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) rearrangements are two of the most common genetic abnormalities associated with prostate cancer. Prior studies have demonstrated these alterations portend worse clinical outcomes. Our objective is to evaluate the impact of biopsy-determined PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion on biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients who receive SBRT for localized prostate cancer. METHODS/MATERIALS: Patients received SBRT for localized prostate cancer on a prospective quality-of-life (QoL) and cancer outcomes study. For each patient, the single biopsy core with the highest grade/volume of cancer was evaluated for PTEN and ERG abnormalities. Differences in baseline patient and disease characteristics between groups were analyzed using ANOVA for age and chi(2) for categorical groupings. bPFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) method with Log-Rank test comparison between groups. Predictors of bPFS and OS were identified using the Cox proportional hazards method. For all analyses, p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Ninety-nine consecutive patients were included in the analysis with a median follow-up of 72 months. A statistically significant improvement in bPFS (p = 0.018) was observed for wild type ERG patients with an estimated 5-year bPFS of 94.1% vs. 72.4%. Regarding PTEN mutational status, significant improvements in were observed in both bPFS (p = 0.006) and OS (p < 0.001), with estimated 5-year bPFS rates of 91.0% vs. 67.9% and 5-year OS rates of 96.4% vs. 79.4%. When including both ERG and PTEN mutational status in the analysis, there were statistically significant differences in both bPFS (p = 0.011) and OS (p < 0.001). The estimated 5-year bPFS rates were 100%, 76.6%, 72.9%, and 63.8% for patients with ERG+/PTEN+, ERG-/PTEN+, ERG+/PTEN-, and ERG-/PTEN- phenotypes respectively. The estimated 5-year OS rates were 93.9%, 100%, 80.0%, and 78.7% for patients with ERG+/PTEN+, ERG-/PTEN+, ERG+/PTEN-, and ERG-/PTEN- phenotypes respectively. CONCLUSION: ERG rearrangements and PTEN deletions detected on biopsy samples are associated with poorer oncologic outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT and merit further study in a dedicated prospective trial."
38584282,Machine learning pipeline to analyze clinical and proteomics data: experiences on a prostate cancer case.,"Proteomic-based analysis is used to identify biomarkers in blood samples and tissues. Data produced by devices such as mass spectrometry requires platforms to identify and quantify proteins (or peptides). Clinical information can be related to mass spectrometry data to identify diseases at an early stage. Machine learning techniques can be used to support physicians and biologists in studying and classifying pathologies. We present the application of machine learning techniques to define a pipeline aimed at studying and classifying proteomics data enriched using clinical information. The pipeline allows users to relate established blood biomarkers with clinical parameters and proteomics data. The proposed pipeline entails three main phases: (i) feature selection, (ii) models training, and (iii) models ensembling. We report the experience of applying such a pipeline to prostate-related diseases. Models have been trained on several biological datasets. We report experimental results about two datasets that result from the integration of clinical and mass spectrometry-based data in the contexts of serum and urine analysis. The pipeline receives input data from blood analytes, tissue samples, proteomic analysis, and urine biomarkers. It then trains different models for feature selection, classification and voting. The presented pipeline has been applied on two datasets obtained in a 2 years research project which aimed to extract hidden information from mass spectrometry, serum, and urine samples from hundreds of patients. We report results on analyzing prostate datasets serum with 143 samples, including 79 PCa and 84 BPH patients, and an urine dataset with 121 samples, including 67 PCa and 54 BPH patients. As results pipeline allowed to identify interesting peptides in the two datasets, 6 for the first one and 2 for the second one. The best model for both serum (AUC=0.87, Accuracy=0.83, F1=0.81, Sensitivity=0.84, Specificity=0.81) and urine (AUC=0.88, Accuracy=0.83, F1=0.83, Sensitivity=0.85, Specificity=0.80) datasets showed good predictive performances. We made the pipeline code available on GitHub and we are confident that it will be successfully adopted in similar clinical setups."
38583868,Cancer Stage Compared With Mortality as End Points in Randomized Clinical Trials of Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials of cancer screening typically use cancer-specific mortality as the primary end point. The incidence of stage III-IV cancer is a potential alternative end point that may accelerate completion of randomized clinical trials of cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To compare cancer-specific mortality with stage III-IV cancer as end points in randomized clinical trials of cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This meta-analysis included 41 randomized clinical trials of cancer screening conducted in Europe, North America, and Asia published through February 19, 2024. Data extracted included numbers of participants, cancer diagnoses, and cancer deaths in the intervention and comparison groups. For each clinical trial, the effect of screening was calculated as the percentage reduction between the intervention and comparison groups in the incidence of participants with cancer-specific mortality and stage III-IV cancer. EXPOSURES: Randomization to a cancer screening test or to a comparison group in a clinical trial of cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: End points of cancer-specific mortality and incidence of stage III-IV cancer were compared using Pearson correlation coefficients with 95% CIs, linear regression, and fixed-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The included randomized clinical trials tested benefits of screening for breast (n = 6), colorectal (n = 11), lung (n = 12), ovarian (n = 4), prostate (n = 4), and other cancers (n = 4). Correlation between reductions in cancer-specific mortality and stage III-IV cancer varied by cancer type (I2 = 65%; P = .02). Correlation was highest for trials that screened for ovarian (Pearson rho = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.51-1.00]) and lung (Pearson rho = 0.92 [95% CI, 0.72-0.98]) cancers, moderate for breast cancer (Pearson rho = 0.70 [95% CI, -0.26 to 0.96]), and weak for colorectal (Pearson rho = 0.39 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.80]) and prostate (Pearson rho = -0.69 [95% CI, -0.99 to 0.81]) cancers. Slopes from linear regression were estimated as 1.15 for ovarian cancer, 0.75 for lung cancer, 0.40 for colorectal cancer, 0.28 for breast cancer, and -3.58 for prostate cancer, suggesting that a given magnitude of reduction in incidence of stage III-IV cancer produced different magnitudes of change in incidence of cancer-specific mortality (P for heterogeneity = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In randomized clinical trials of cancer screening, incidence of late-stage cancer may be a suitable alternative end point to cancer-specific mortality for some cancer types, but is not suitable for others. These results have implications for clinical trials of multicancer screening tests."
38583453,The Lancet Commission on prostate cancer: planning for the surge in cases.,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in 112 countries, and accounts for 15% of cancers. In this Commission, we report projections of prostate cancer cases in 2040 on the basis of data for demographic changes worldwide and rising life expectancy. Our findings suggest that the number of new cases annually will rise from 1.4 million in 2020 to 2.9 million by 2040. This surge in cases cannot be prevented by lifestyle changes or public health interventions alone, and governments need to prepare strategies to deal with it. We have projected trends in the incidence of prostate cancer and related mortality (assuming no changes in treatment) in the next 10-15 years, and make recommendations on how to deal with these issues. For the Commission, we established four working groups, each of which examined a different aspect of prostate cancer: epidemiology and future projected trends in cases, the diagnostic pathway, treatment, and management of advanced disease, the main problem for most men diagnosed with prostate cancer worldwide. Throughout we have separated problems in high-income countries (HICs) from those in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), although we acknowledge that this distinction can be an oversimplification (some rich patients in LMICs can access high-quality care, whereas many patients in HICs, especially the USA, cannot because of inadequate insurance coverage). The burden of disease globally is already substantial, but options to improve care are already available at moderate cost. We found that late diagnosis is widespread worldwide, but especially in LMICs, where it is the norm. Early diagnosis improves prognosis and outcomes, and reduces societal and individual costs, and we recommend changes to the diagnostic pathway that can be immediately implemented. For men diagnosed with advanced disease, optimal use of available technologies, adjusted to the resource levels available, could produce improved outcomes. We also found that demographic changes (ie, changing age structures and increasing life expectancy) in LMICs will drive big increases in prostate cancer, and cases are also projected to rise in high-income countries. This projected rise in cases has driven the main thrust of our recommendations throughout. Dealing with this rise in cases will require urgent and radical interventions, particularly in LMICs, including an emphasis on education (both of health professionals and the general population) linked to outreach programmes to increase awareness. If implemented, these interventions would shift the case mix from advanced to earlier-stage disease, which in turn would necessitate different treatment approaches: earlier diagnosis would prompt a shift from palliative to curative therapies based around surgery and radiotherapy. Although age-adjusted mortality from prostate cancer is falling in HICs, it is rising in LMICs. And, despite large, well known differences in disease incidence and mortality by ethnicity (eg, incidence in men of African heritage is roughly double that in men of European heritage), most prostate cancer research has disproportionally focused on men of European heritage. Without urgent action, these trends will cause global deaths from prostate cancer to rise rapidly."
38583093,Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes: A SMART-C Collaborative Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) consistently improve heart failure and kidney-related outcomes; however, effects on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) across different patient populations are less clear. METHODS: This was a collaborative trial-level meta-analysis from the SGLT2i Meta-analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists Consortium, which includes all phase 3, placebo-controlled, outcomes trials of SGLT2i across 3 patient populations (patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure [HF], or chronic kidney disease). The outcomes of interest were MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction , or stroke), individual components of MACE (inclusive of fatal and nonfatal events), all-cause mortality, and death subtypes. Effect estimates for SGLT2i versus placebo were meta-analyzed across trials and examined across key subgroups (established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, previous HF, albuminuria, chronic kidney disease stages, and risk groups). RESULTS: A total of 78 607 patients across 11 trials were included: 42 568 (54.2%), 20 725 (26.4%), and 15 314 (19.5%) were included from trials of patients with diabetes at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF, or chronic kidney disease, respectively. SGLT2i reduced the rate of MACE by 9% (hazard ration [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.96], P<0.0001) with a consistent effect across all 3 patient populations (I(2)=0%) and across all key subgroups. This effect was primarily driven by a reduction in cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.81-0.92], P<0.0001), with no significant effect for myocardial infarction in the overall population (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87-1.04], P=0.29), and no effect on stroke (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.91-1.07], P=0.77). The benefit for cardiovascular death was driven primarily by reductions in HF death and sudden cardiac death (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.46-1.02] and HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78-0.95], respectively) and was generally consistent across subgroups, with the possible exception of being more apparent in those with albuminuria (P(interaction)=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: SGLT2i reduce the risk of MACE across a broad range of patients irrespective of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney function, or other major clinical characteristics at baseline. This effect is driven primarily by a reduction of cardiovascular death, particularly HF death and sudden cardiac death, without a significant effect on myocardial infarction in the overall population, and no effect on stroke. These data may help inform selection for SGLT2i therapies across the spectrum of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic disease."
38582811,The prognostic value of MEK pathway-associated estrogen receptor signaling activity for female cancers.,"BACKGROUND: Other than for breast cancer, endocrine therapy has not been highly effective for gynecologic cancers. Endocrine therapy resistance in estrogen receptor positive gynecologic cancers is still poorly understood. In this retrospective study, we examined the estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathway activities of breast, ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers to identify those that may predict endocrine therapy responsiveness. METHODS: Clinical and genomic data of women with breast and gynecological cancers were downloaded from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression level and sample-level pathway enrichment scores (EERES) were calculated to classify patients into four groups (low/high ESR1 and low/high EERES). Correlation between ESR1/EERES score and survival was further validated with RNAseq data from low-grade serous ovarian cancer. Pathway analyses were performed among different ESR1/EERES groups to identify genes that correlate with endocrine resistance, which are validated using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia gene expression and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer data. RESULTS: We identified a novel combined prognostic value of ESR1 expression and the corresponding estrogen response signaling (EERES score) for breast cancer. The combined prognostic value (ESR1/EERES) may be applicable to other gynecologic cancers. More importantly, we discovered that ER signaling can cross-regulate MEK pathway activation. We identified downstream genes in the MEK pathway (EPHA2, INAVA, MALL, MPZL2, PCDH1, and TNFRSF21) that are potential endocrine therapy response biomarkers. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that targeting both the ER and the ER signaling activity related MEK pathway may aid the development of endocrine therapy strategies for personalized medicine."
38581481,Genomic ancestry and cancer among Latin Americans.,"Latin American populations, characterized by intricate admixture patterns resulting from the intermingling of ancestries from European, Native American (NA) Asian, and African ancestries which result in a vast and complex genetic landscape, harboring unique combinations of novel variants. This genetic diversity not only poses challenges in traditional population genetics methods but also opens avenues for a deeper understanding of its implications in health. In cancer, the interplay between genetic ancestry, lifestyle factors, and healthcare disparities adds a layer of complexity to the varying incidence and mortality rates observed across different Latin American subpopulations. This complex interdependence has been unveiled through numerous studies, whether conducted on Latin American patients residing on the continent or abroad, revealing discernible differences in germline composition that influence divergent disease phenotypes such as higher incidence of Luminal B and Her2 breast tumors, EGFR and KRAS mutated lung adenocarcinomas in addition to an enrichment in BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and a higher than expected prevalence of variants in colorectal cancer associated genes such as APC and MLH1. In prostate cancer novel risk variants have also been solely identified in Latin American populations. Due to the complexity of genetic divergence, inputs from each individual ancestry seem to carry independent contributions that interplay in the development of these complex disease phenotypes. By understanding these unique population characteristics, genomic ancestries hold a promising avenue for tailoring prognostic assessments and optimizing responses to oncological interventions."
38581448,Integration of Pan-Cancer Cell Line and Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiles Enables Inference of Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Heterogeneous Tumors.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) greatly advanced the understanding of intratumoral heterogeneity by identifying distinct cancer cell subpopulations. However, translating biological differences into treatment strategies is challenging due to a lack of tools to facilitate efficient drug discovery that tackles heterogeneous tumors. Developing such approaches requires accurate prediction of drug response at the single-cell level to offer therapeutic options to specific cell subpopulations. Here, we developed a transparent computational framework (nicknamed scIDUC) to predict therapeutic efficacies on an individual cell basis by integrating single-cell transcriptomic profiles with large, data-rich pan-cancer cell line screening data sets. This method achieved high accuracy in separating cells into their correct cellular drug response statuses. In three distinct prospective tests covering different diseases (rhabdomyosarcoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate cancer), the predicted results using scIDUC were accurate and mirrored biological expectations. In the first two tests, the framework identified drugs for cell subpopulations that were resistant to standard-of-care (SOC) therapies due to intrinsic resistance or tumor microenvironmental effects, and the results showed high consistency with experimental findings from the original studies. In the third test using newly generated SOC therapy-resistant cell lines, scIDUC identified efficacious drugs for the resistant line, and the predictions were validated with in vitro experiments. Together, this study demonstrates the potential of scIDUC to quickly translate scRNA-seq data into drug responses for individual cells, displaying the potential as a tool to improve the treatment of heterogenous tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: A versatile method that infers cell-level drug response in scRNA-seq data facilitates the development of therapeutic strategies to target heterogeneous subpopulations within a tumor and address issues such as treatment failure and resistance."
38580966,Comprehensive analyses of the cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes and their score system for prediction of outcomes and immunosuppressive microenvironment in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive cancer progression and treatment failure on one hand, while their tumor-restraining functions are also observed on the other. Recent single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses demonstrates heterogeneity of CAFs and defines molecular subtypes of CAFs, which help explain their different functions. However, it remains unclear whether these CAF subtypes have the same or different biological/clinical implications in prostate cancer (PCa) or other malignancies. METHODS: PCa cells were incubated with supernatant from normal fibroblasts and CAFs to assess their effects on cell behaviors. Sequencing, genomic, and clinical data were collected from TCGA, MSKCC, CPGEA and GEO databases. CAF molecular subtypes and total CAF scores were constructed and grouped into low and high groups based on CAF-specific gene expression. Progression free interval (PFI), clinicopathological features, telomere length, immune cell infiltration, drug treatment and somatic mutations were compared among CAF molecular subtypes and low/high score groups. RESULTS: The PCa CAF-derived supernatant promoted PCa cell proliferation and invasion. Based on differentially expressed genes identified by scRNA-seq analyses, we classified CAFs into 6 molecular subtypes in PCa tumors, and each subtype was then categorized into score-high and low groups according to the subtype-specific gene expression level. Such score models in 6 CAF subtypes all predicted PFI. Telomeres were significantly shorter in high-score tumors. The total CAF score from 6 CAF subtypes was also associated with PFI in PCa patients inversely, which was consistent with results from cellular experiments. Immunosuppressive microenvironment occurred more frequently in tumors with a high CAF score, which was characterized by increased CTLA4 expression and indicated better responses to CTLA4 inhibitors. Moreover, this model can also serve as a useful PFI predictor in pan-cancers. CONCLUSION: By combining scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data analyses, we develop a CAF subtype score system as a prognostic factor for PCa and other cancer types. This model system also helps distinguish different immune-suppressive mechanisms in PCa, suggesting its implications in predicting response to immunotherapy. Thus, the present findings should contribute to personalized PCa intervention."
38580319,Comprehensive Prostate Fluid-Based Spectral Libraries for Enhanced Protein Detection in Urine.,"Biofluids contain molecules in circulation and from nearby organs that can be indicative of disease states. Characterizing the proteome of biofluids with DIA-MS is an emerging area of interest for biomarker discovery; yet, there is limited consensus on DIA-MS data analysis approaches for analyzing large numbers of biofluids. To evaluate various DIA-MS workflows, we collected urine from a clinically heterogeneous cohort of prostate cancer patients and acquired data in DDA and DIA scan modes. We then searched the DIA data against urine spectral libraries generated using common library generation approaches or a library-free method. We show that DIA-MS doubles the sample throughput compared to standard DDA-MS with minimal losses to peptide detection. We further demonstrate that using a sample-specific spectral library generated from individual urines maximizes peptide detection compared to a library-free approach, a pan-human library, or libraries generated from pooled, fractionated urines. Adding urine subproteomes, such as the urinary extracellular vesicular proteome, to the urine spectral library further improves the detection of prostate proteins in unfractionated urine. Altogether, we present an optimized DIA-MS workflow and provide several high-quality, comprehensive prostate cancer urine spectral libraries that can streamline future biomarker discovery studies of prostate cancer using DIA-MS."
38579192,Repeat Next-Generation Sequencing Testing on Progression in Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Can Identify New Actionable Alterations.,"PURPOSE: There are limited data available on the real-world patterns of molecular testing in men with advanced prostate cancer. We thus sought to evaluate next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing in the United States, focused on single versus serial NGS testing, the different disease states of testing (hormone-sensitive v castration-resistant, metastatic vs nonmetastatic), tissue versus plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays, and how often actionable data were found on each NGS test. METHODS: The Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine Multi-Institutional Collaborative Effort clinical-genomic database was used for this retrospective analysis, including 1,597 patients across 15 institutions. Actionable NGS data were defined as including somatic alterations in homologous recombination repair genes, mismatch repair deficiency, microsatellite instability (MSI-high), or a high tumor mutational burden >/=10 mut/MB. RESULTS: Serial NGS testing (two or more NGS tests with specimens collected more than 60 days apart) was performed in 9% (n = 144) of patients with a median of 182 days in between test results. For the second NGS test and beyond, 82.1% (225 of 274) of tests were from ctDNA assays and 76.1% (217 of 285) were collected in the metastatic castration-resistant setting. New actionable data were found on 11.1% (16 of 144) of second NGS tests, with 3.5% (5 of 144) of tests detecting a new BRCA2 alteration or MSI-high. A targeted therapy (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor or immunotherapy) was given after an actionable result on the second NGS test in 31.3% (5 of 16) of patients. CONCLUSION: Repeat somatic NGS testing in men with prostate cancer is infrequently performed in practice and can identify new actionable alterations not present with initial testing, suggesting the utility of repeat molecular profiling with tissue or blood of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer to guide therapy choices."
38579171,Multidimensional data analysis revealed thyroiditis-associated TCF19 SNP rs2073724 as a highly ranked protective variant in thyroid cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer represents the most prevalent malignant endocrine tumour, with rising incidence worldwide and high mortality rates among patients exhibiting dedifferentiation and metastasis. Effective biomarkers and therapeutic interventions are warranted in aggressive thyroid malignancies. The transcription factor 19 (TCF19) gene has been implicated in conferring a malignant phenotype in cancers. However, its contribution to thyroid neoplasms remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we performed genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies to identify a potential causal relationship between TCF19 and thyroid cancer. Our analyses revealed significant associations between TCF19 and various autoimmune diseases and human cancers, including cervical cancer and autoimmune thyroiditis, with a particularly robust signal for the deleterious missense variation rs2073724 that is associated with thyroid function, hypothyroidism, and autoimmunity. Furthermore, functional assays and transcriptional profiling in thyroid cancer cells demonstrated that TCF19 regulates important biological processes, especially inflammatory and immune responses. We demonstrated that TCF19 could promote the progression of thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo and the C>T variant of rs2073724 disrupted TCF19 protein binding to target gene promoters and their expression, thus reversing the effect of TCF19 protein. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings implicate TCF19 as a promising therapeutic target in aggressive thyroid malignancies and designate rs2073724 as a causal biomarker warranting further investigation in thyroid cancer."
38578195,"Co-targeting BET, CBP, and p300 inhibits neuroendocrine signalling in androgen receptor-null prostate cancer.","There are diverse phenotypes of castration-resistant prostate cancer, including neuroendocrine disease, that vary in their sensitivity to drug treatment. The efficacy of BET and CBP/p300 inhibitors in prostate cancer is attributed, at least in part, to their ability to decrease androgen receptor (AR) signalling. However, the activity of BET and CBP/p300 inhibitors in prostate cancers that lack the AR is unclear. In this study, we showed that BRD4, CBP, and p300 were co-expressed in AR-positive and AR-null prostate cancer. A combined inhibitor of these three proteins, NEO2734, reduced the growth of both AR-positive and AR-null organoids, as measured by changes in viability, size, and composition. NEO2734 treatment caused consistent transcriptional downregulation of cell cycle pathways. In neuroendocrine models, NEO2734 treatment reduced ASCL1 levels and other neuroendocrine markers, and reduced tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, these results show that epigenome-targeted inhibitors cause decreased growth and phenotype-dependent disruption of lineage regulators in neuroendocrine prostate cancer, warranting further development of compounds with this activity in the clinic.

38577608,Identification of Molecular Subtype and Prognostic Signature for Prostate Adenocarcinoma based on Neutrophil Extracellular Traps.,"Background: Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is one of the most common cancers in male. Increasing evidences pointed out that Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) play an important role in tumor angiogenesis, tumor metastasis and drug resistance. However, limited systematic studies regarding the role of NETs in PRAD have been performed. Identification of biomarkers based on NETs might facilitate risk stratification which help optimizing the clinical strategies. Methods: NETs-related genes with differential expressions were identified between PRAD and adjacent normal tissues in TCGA-PRAD dataset. Consensus cluster analysis was performed to determine the PRAD subtypes based on the different-expressed NETs-related genes. The difference of pathway enrichment, infiltrating immune cell and genomic mutation were also evaluated between subtypes. LASSO cox regression analysis was conducted to construct a NETs-related prognostic signature. Result: We identified 19 NETs related genes with differential expressions between PRAD and adjacent normal tissue in TCGA-PRAD dataset. Two significant subtypes were identified based on these 19 genes by consensus cluster analysis, namely subtype 1 and subtype 2. Significant differences in prognosis, immune infiltration and tumor mutation burden were observed in subtypes. LASSO Cox regression analysis identified a NETs-associated prognostic signature including 13 genes, and this signature had a good performance in predicting the progression-free survival of PRAD patients. Further integrated analysis indicated that MMP9 mostly expressed in Mono/Macrophage cells might play a role in regulating NETs formation via neutrophil activation in PRAD. Conclusion: To sum up, the current study identified two NETs-related molecular subtypes and based on which constructed a prognostic signature for PRAD."
38577257,Population-enriched innate immune variants may identify candidate gene targets at the intersection of cancer and cardio-metabolic disease.,"Both cancer and cardio-metabolic disease disparities exist among specific populations in the US. For example, African Americans experience the highest rates of breast and prostate cancer mortality and the highest incidence of obesity. Native and Hispanic Americans experience the highest rates of liver cancer mortality. At the same time, Pacific Islanders have the highest death rate attributed to type 2 diabetes (T2D), and Asian Americans experience the highest incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cancers induced by infectious agents. Notably, the pathologic progression of both cancer and cardio-metabolic diseases involves innate immunity and mechanisms of inflammation. Innate immunity in individuals is established through genetic inheritance and external stimuli to respond to environmental threats and stresses such as pathogen exposure. Further, individual genomes contain characteristic genetic markers associated with one or more geographic ancestries (ethnic groups), including protective innate immune genetic programming optimized for survival in their corresponding ancestral environment(s). This perspective explores evidence related to our working hypothesis that genetic variations in innate immune genes, particularly those that are commonly found but unevenly distributed between populations, are associated with disparities between populations in both cancer and cardio-metabolic diseases. Identifying conventional and unconventional innate immune genes that fit this profile may provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms that connect these two families of complex diseases and offer novel targets for precision-based treatment of cancer and/or cardio-metabolic disease."
38576998,Predicting prostate cancer progression with a Multi-lncRNA expression-based risk score and nomogram integrating ISUP grading.,"Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease; therefore, estimating patient prognosis accurately is challenging due to the lack of biomarkers with sufficient specificity and sensitivity. One of the current challenges lies in integrating genomic and transcriptomic data with clinico-pathological features and in incorporating their application in everyday clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to model a risk score and nomogram containing long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression and clinico-pathological data to better predict the probability of prostate cancer progression. We performed bioinformatics analyses to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed across various prostate cancer stages and associated with progression-free survival. This information was further integrated into a prognostic risk score and nomogram containing transcriptomic and clinico-pathological features to estimate the risk of disease progression. We used RNA-seq data from 5 datasets from public repositories (total n = 178) comprising different stages of prostate cancer: pre-treatment primary prostate adenocarcinomas, post-treatment tumors and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. We found 30 lncRNAs with consistent differential expression in all comparisons made using two R-based packages. Multivariate progression-free survival analysis including the ISUP group as covariate, revealed that 7/30 lncRNAs were significantly associated with time-to-progression. Next, we combined the expression of these 7 lncRNAs into a multi-lncRNA score and dichotomized the patients into low- or high-score. Patients with a high-score showed a 4-fold risk of disease progression (HR = 4.30, 95 %CI = 2.66-6.97, p = 3.1e-9). Furthermore, we modelled a combined risk-score containing information on the multi-lncRNA score and ISUP group. We found that patients with a high-risk score had nearly 8-fold risk of progression (HR = 7.65, 95 %CI = 4.05-14.44, p = 3.4e-10). Finally, we created and validated a nomogram to help uro-oncologists to better predict patient's risk of progression at 3- and 5-years post-diagnosis. In conclusion, the integration of lncRNA expression data and clinico-pathological features of prostate tumors into predictive models might aid in tailored disease risk assessment and treatment for patients with prostate cancer."
38575966,Identification of ferroptosis related genes and pathways in prostate cancer cells under erastin exposure.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies are focusing on the mechanism of erastin acts on prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and essential ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) that can be PCa therapeutic targets are rarely known. METHODS: In this study, in vitro assays were performed and RNA-sequencing was used to measure the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in erastin-induced PCa cells. A series of bioinformatic analyses were applied to analyze the pathways and DEGs. RESULTS: Erastin inhibited the expression of SLC7A11 and cell survivability in LNCaP and PC3 cells. After treatment with erastin, the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Fe(2+) significantly increased, whereas the glutathione (GSH) and the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) significantly decreased in both cells. A total of 295 overlapping DEGs were identified under erastin exposure and significantly enriched in several pathways, including DNA replication and cell cycle. The percentage of LNCaP and PC3 cells in G1 phase was markedly increased in response to erastin treatment. For four hub FRGs, TMEFF2 was higher in PCa tissue and the expression levels of NRXN3, CLU, and UNC5B were lower in PCa tissue. The expression levels of SLC7A11 and cell survivability were inhibited after the knockdown of TMEFF2 in androgen-dependent cell lines (LNCaP and VCaP) but not in androgen-independent cell lines (PC3 and C4-2). The concentration of Fe(2+) only significantly increased in TMEFF2 downregulated LNCaP and VCaP cells. CONCLUSION: TMEFF2 might be likely to develop into a potential ferroptosis target in PCa and this study extends our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in erastin-affected PCa cells."
38573545,The Evolving Landscape of Cervical Cancer: Breakthroughs in Screening and Therapy Through Integrating Biotechnology and Artificial Intelligence.,"Cervical cancer (CC) continues to be a major worldwide health concern, profoundly impacting the lives of countless females worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where CC prevalence is high, innovative, and cost-effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are vital. These approaches must ensure high response rates with minimal side effects to improve outcomes. The study aims to compile the latest developments in the field of CC, providing insights into the promising future of CC management along with the research gaps and challenges. Integrating biotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense potential to revolutionize CC care, from MobileODT screening to precision medicine and innovative therapies. AI enhances healthcare accuracy and improves patient outcomes, especially in CC screening, where its use has increased over the years, showing promising results. Also, combining newly developed strategies with conventional treatment options presents an optimal approach to address the limitations associated with conventional methods. However, further clinical studies are essential for practically implementing these advancements in society. By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies and approaches, there is a substantial opportunity to reduce the global burden of this preventable malignancy, ultimately improving the lives of women in LMICs and beyond."
38572916,Identification and validation of a novel anoikis-related prognostic model for prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Anoikis resistance is a hallmark characteristic of oncogenic transformation, which is crucial for tumor progression and metastasis. The aim of this study was to identify and validate a novel anoikis-related prognostic model for prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: We collected a gene expression profile, single nucleotide polymorphism mutation and copy number variation (CNV) data of 495 PCa patients from the TCGA database and 140 PCa samples from the MSKCC dataset. We extracted 434 anoikis-related genes and unsupervised consensus cluster analysis was used to identify molecular subtypes. The immune infiltration, molecular function, and genome alteration of subtypes were evaluated. A risk signature was developed using Cox regression analysis and validated with the MSKCC dataset. We also identify potential drugs for high-risk group patients. RESULTS: Two subtypes were identified. C1 exhibited a higher level of CNV amplification, immune score, stromal score, aneuploidy score, homologous recombination deficiency, intratumor heterogeneity, single-nucleotide variant neoantigens, and tumor mutational burden compared to C2. C2 showed a better survival outcome and had a high level of gamma delta T cell and activated B cell infiltration. The risk signature consisting of four genes (HELLS, ZWINT, ABCC5, and TPSB2) was developed (area under the curve = 0.780) and was found to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in PCa patients. Four CTRP-derived and four PRISM-derived compounds were identified for high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: The anoikis-related prognostic model developed in this study could be a useful tool for clinical decision-making. This study may provide a new perspective for the treatment of anoikis-related PCa."
38571290,Development of a multigenomic liquid biopsy (PROSTest) for prostate cancer in whole blood.,"INTRODUCTION: We describe the development of a molecular assay from publicly available tumor tissue mRNA databases using machine learning and present preliminary evidence of functionality as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for prostate cancer (PCa) in whole blood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 1055 PCas (public microarray data sets) to identify putative mRNA biomarkers. Specificity was confirmed against 32 different solid and hematological cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 10,990). This defined a 27-gene panel which was validated by qPCR in 50 histologically confirmed PCa surgical specimens and matched blood. An ensemble classifier (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost) was trained in age-matched PCas (n = 294), and in 72 controls and 64 BPH. Classifier performance was validated in two independent sets (n = 263 PCas; n = 99 controls). We assessed the panel as a postoperative disease monitor in a radical prostatectomy cohort (RPC: n = 47). RESULTS: A PCa-specific 27-gene panel was identified. Matched blood and tumor gene expression levels were concordant (r = 0.72, p < 0.0001). The ensemble classifier (""PROSTest"") was scaled 0%-100% and the industry-standard operating point of >/=50% used to define a PCa. Using this, the PROSTest exhibited an 85% sensitivity and 95% specificity for PCa versus controls. In two independent sets, the metrics were 92%-95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In the RPCs (n = 47), PROSTest scores decreased from 72% +/- 7% to 33% +/- 16% (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). PROSTest was 26% +/- 8% in 37 with normal postoperative PSA levels (<0.1 ng/mL). In 10 with elevated postoperative PSA, PROSTest was 60% +/- 4%. CONCLUSION: A 27-gene whole blood signature for PCa is concordant with tissue mRNA levels. Measuring blood expression provides a minimally invasive genomic tool that may facilitate prostate cancer management."
38570271,Variation in management of lymph node positive prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy within a statewide quality improvement consortium.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with lymph node positive (pN+) disease found at the time of radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) are at high risk of disease persistence and progression. Contemporary management trends of pN+ CaP are not well described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients in the Michigan Urologic Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2012 and 2023 with cN0/pN+ disease were identified. The primary outcome was to evaluate patient and practice-level factors associated with time to secondary post-RP treatment. Secondary outcomes included practice-level variation in management of pN+ CaP and rates of secondary treatment modality. To assess factors associated with secondary treatment, a Cox proportional hazards model of a 60-day landmark analysis was performed. RESULTS: We identified 666 patients with pN+ disease. Overall, 66% underwent secondary treatment within 12 months post-RP. About 19% of patients with detectable post-RP PSA did not receive treatment. Of patients receiving secondary treatment after 60-days post-RP, 34% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone, 27% received radiation (RT) alone, 36% received combination, and 4% received other systemic therapies. In the multivariable model, pathologic grade group (GG)3 (HR 1.5; 95%CI: 1.05-2.14), GG4-5 (HR 1.65; 95%CI: 1.16-2.34), positive margins (HR 1.46; 95%CI: 1.13-1.88), and detectable postoperative PSA >/=0.1 ng/ml (HR 3.46; 95%CI: 2.61-4.59) were significantly associated with secondary post-RP treatment. There was wide variation in adjusted practice-level 12-month secondary treatment utilization (28%-79%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority pN+ patients receive treatment within 12 months post-RP which was associated with high-risk pathological features and post-RP PSA. Variation in management of pN+ disease highlights the uncertainty regarding the optimal management. Understanding which patients will benefit from secondary treatment, and which type, will be critical to minimize variation in care."
38567159,Molecular aspects of cervical cancer: a pathogenesis update.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a significant health problem, especially in low-income countries. Functional studies on the human papillomavirus have generated essential advances in the knowledge of CC. However, many unanswered questions remain. This mini-review discusses the latest results on CC pathogenesis, HPV oncogenesis, and molecular changes identified through next-generation technologies. Interestingly, the percentage of samples with HPV genome integrations correlates with the degree of the cervical lesions, suggesting a role in the development of CC. Also, new functions have been described for the viral oncoproteins E5, E6, and E7, resulting in the acquisition and maintenance of cancer hallmarks, including proliferation, immune response evasion, apoptosis, and genomic instability. Remarkably, E5 oncoprotein affects signaling pathways involved in the expression of interferon-induced genes and EGFR-induced proliferation, while E6 and E7 oncoproteins regulate the DNA damage repair and cell cycle continuity pathways. Furthermore, next-generation technologies provide vast amounts of information, increasing our knowledge of changes in the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and epigenome in CC. These studies have identified novel molecular traits associated with disease susceptibility, degree of progression, treatment response, and survival as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
38566827,Causal relationship between immune cells and prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the abundance of research indicating the participation of immune cells in prostate cancer development, establishing a definitive cause-and-effect relationship has proven to be a difficult undertaking. METHODS: This study employs Mendelian randomization (MR), leveraging genetic variables related to immune cells from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to investigate this association. The primary analytical method used in this study is inverse variance weighting (IVW) analysis. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy of the results. RESULTS: The study identifies four immune cell traits as causally contributing to prostate cancer risk, including CD127- CD8+ T cell %CD8+ T cell (OR = 1.0042, 95%CI:1.0011-1.0073, p = 0.0077), CD45RA on CD39+ resting CD4 regulatory T cell (OR = 1.0029, 95%CI:1.0008-1.0050, p = 0.0065), CD62L- Dendritic Cell Absolute Count (OR = 1.0016; 95%CI:1.0005-1.0026; p = 0.0039), CX3CR1 on CD14+ CD16- monocyte (OR = 1.0024, 95%CI:1.0007-1.0040, p = 0.0060). Additionally, two immune cell traits are identified as causally protective factors: CD4 on monocyte (OR = 0.9975, 95%CI:0.9958-0.9992, p = 0.0047), FSC-A on plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell (OR = 0.9983, 95%CI:0.9970-0.9995, p = 0.0070). Sensitivity analyses indicated no horizontal pleiotropy. DISCUSSION: Our MR study provide evidence for a causal relationship between immune cells and prostate cancer, holding implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
38566104,Race-specific coregulatory and transcriptomic profiles associated with DNA methylation and androgen receptor in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a significant health concern, particularly among African American (AA) men who exhibit higher incidence and mortality compared to European American (EA) men. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disparities is imperative for enhancing clinical management and achieving better outcomes. METHODS: Employing a multi-omics approach, we analyzed prostate cancer in both AA and EA men. Using Illumina methylation arrays and RNA sequencing, we investigated DNA methylation and gene expression in tumor and non-tumor prostate tissues. Additionally, Boolean analysis was utilized to unravel complex networks contributing to racial disparities in prostate cancer. RESULTS: When comparing tumor and adjacent non-tumor prostate tissues, we found that DNA hypermethylated regions are enriched for PRC2/H3K27me3 pathways and EZH2/SUZ12 cofactors. Olfactory/ribosomal pathways and distinct cofactors, including CTCF and KMT2A, were enriched in DNA hypomethylated regions in prostate tumors from AA men. We identified race-specific inverse associations of DNA methylation with expression of several androgen receptor (AR) associated genes, including the GATA family of transcription factors and TRIM63. This suggests that race-specific dysregulation of the AR signaling pathway exists in prostate cancer. To investigate the effect of AR inhibition on race-specific gene expression changes, we generated in-silico patient-specific prostate cancer Boolean networks. Our simulations revealed prolonged AR inhibition causes significant dysregulation of TGF-beta, IDH1, and cell cycle pathways specifically in AA prostate cancer. We further quantified global gene expression changes, which revealed differential expression of genes related to microtubules, immune function, and TMPRSS2-fusion pathways, specifically in prostate tumors of AA men. Enrichment of these pathways significantly correlated with an altered risk of disease progression in a race-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals unique signaling networks underlying prostate cancer biology in AA and EA men, offering potential insights for clinical management strategies tailored to specific racial groups. Targeting AR and associated pathways could be particularly beneficial in addressing the disparities observed in prostate cancer outcomes in the context of AA and EA men. Further investigation into these identified pathways may lead to the development of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients across different racial backgrounds."
38566028,Population-based BRCA germline mutation screening in the Han Chinese identifies individuals at risk of BRCA mutation-related cancer: experience from a clinical diagnostic center from greater Shanghai area.,"BACKGROUND: Deleterious BRCA1/2 (BRCA) mutation raises the risk for BRCA mutation-related malignancies, including breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Germline variation of BRCA exhibits substantial ethnical diversity. However, there is limited research on the Chinese Han population, constraining the development of strategies for BRCA mutation screening in this large ethnic group. METHODS: We profile the BRCA mutational spectrum, including single nucleotide variation, insertion/deletion, and large genomic rearrangements in 2,080 apparently healthy Chinese Han individuals and 522 patients with BRCA mutation-related cancer, to determine the BRCA genetic background of the Chinese Han population, especially of the East Han. Incident cancer events were monitored in 1,005 participants from the healthy group, comprising 11 BRCA pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PLP) variant carriers and 994 PLP-free individuals, including 3 LGR carriers. RESULTS: Healthy Chinese Han individuals demonstrated a distinct BRCA mutational spectrum compared to cancer patients, with a 0.53% (1 in 189) prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PLP) variant, alongside a 3 in 2,080 occurrence of LGR. BRCA1 c. 5470_5477del demonstrated high prevalence (0.44%) in the North Han Chinese and penetrance for breast cancer. None of the 3 LGR carriers developed cancer during the follow-up. We calculated a relative risk of 135.55 (95% CI 25.07 to 732.88) for the development of BRCA mutation-related cancers in the BRCA PLP variant carriers (mean age 42.91 years, median follow-up 10 months) compared to PLP-free individuals (mean age 48.47 years, median follow-up 16 months). CONCLUSION: The unique BRCA mutational profile in the Chinese Han highlights the potential for standardized population-based BRCA variant screening to enhance BRCA mutation-related cancer prevention and treatment."
38565944,An integrated ceRNA network identifies miR-375 as an upregulated miRNA playing a tumor suppressive role in aggressive prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among men worldwide. A number of genes have been implicated in prostate tumorigenesis, but the mechanisms underlying their dysregulation are still incompletely understood. Evidence has established the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) theory as a novel regulatory mechanism for post-transcriptional alterations. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of ceRNA network in PCa lacks. Here we utilize stringent in-silico methods to construct a large ceRNA network across different PCa stages, and provide experimental demonstration for the competing regulation among protumorigenic SEC23A, PHTF2, and their corresponding ceRNA pairs. Using machine learning, we establish a ceRNA-based signature (ceRNA_sig) predictive of androgen receptor (AR) activity, tumor aggressiveness, and patient outcomes. Importantly, we identify miR-375 as a key node in PCa ceRNA network, which is upregulated in PCa relative to normal tissues. Forced expression of miR-375 significantly inhibits, while its inhibition promotes, aggressive behaviors of both AR(+) and AR(-) PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that miR-375 predominantly targets genes possessing oncogenic roles (e.g., proliferation, DNA repair, and metastasis), and thus release targets with tumor suppressive functions. This action model well clarifies why an upregulated miRNA plays a tumor suppressive role in PCa. Together, our study provides new insights into understanding of transcriptomic aberrations during PCa evolution, and nominates miR-375 as a potential therapeutic target for combating aggressive PCa."
38565642,"The impact of telomere length on prostate cancer aggressiveness, genomic instability and health disparities.","The telomere repetitive TTAGGG motif at the ends of chromosomes, serves to preserve genomic integrity and chromosomal stability. In turn, genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer-implicating telomere disturbance. Prostate cancer (PCa) shows significant ancestral disparities, with men of African ancestry at the greatest risk for aggressive disease and associated genomic instability. Yet, no study has explored the role of telomere length (TL) with respect to ancestrally driven PCa health disparities. Patient- and technically-matched tumour-blood whole genome sequencing data for 179 ancestrally defined treatment naive PCa patients (117 African, 62 European), we assessed for TL (blood and tumour) associations. We found shortened tumour TL to be associated with aggressive PCa presentation and elevated genomic instabilities, including percentage of genome alteration and copy number gains, in men of African ancestry. For European patients, tumour TL showed significant associations with PCa driver genes PTEN, TP53, MSH2, SETBP1 and DDX11L1, while shorter blood TL (< 3200 base pairs) and tumour TL (< 2861 base pairs) were correlated with higher risk for biochemical recurrence. Concurring with previous studies linking TL to PCa diagnosis and/or prognosis, for the first time we correlated TL differences with patient ancestry with important implications for future treatments targeting telomere dysfunction."
38564048,EP300/CREBBP acetyltransferase inhibition limits steroid receptor and FOXA1 signaling in prostate cancer cells.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a primary target for treating prostate cancer (PCa), forming the bedrock of its clinical management. Despite their efficacy, resistance often hampers AR-targeted therapies, necessitating new strategies against therapy-resistant PCa. These resistances involve various mechanisms, including AR splice variant overexpression and altered activities of transcription factors like the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and FOXA1. These factors rely on common coregulators, such as EP300/CREBBP, suggesting a rationale for coregulator-targeted therapies. Our study explores EP300/CREBBP acetyltransferase inhibition's impact on steroid receptor and FOXA1 signaling in PCa cells using genome-wide techniques. Results reveal that EP300/CREBBP inhibition significantly disrupts the AR-regulated transcriptome and receptor chromatin binding by reducing the AR-gene expression. Similarly, GR's regulated transcriptome and receptor binding were hindered, not linked to reduced GR expression but to diminished FOXA1 chromatin binding, restricting GR signaling. Overall, our findings highlight how EP300/CREBBP inhibition distinctively curtails oncogenic transcription factors' signaling, suggesting the potential of coregulatory-targeted therapies in PCa."
38563883,Targeted interleukin-2 enhances the in vivo anti-cancer activity of Pluvicto.,"PURPOSE: Pluvicto ([(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617), a radioligand therapeutic targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPR). The drug suffers from salivary gland and kidney uptake that prevents its dose escalation to potentially curative doses. In this work, we sought to potentiate the in vivo anti-cancer activity of Pluvicto by combining it with L19-IL2, a clinical-stage investigational medicinal product based on tumor-targeted interleukin-2. METHODS: We established a new PSMA-expressing model (HT-1080.hPSMA) and validated it using a fluoresceine analogue of PSMA-617 (compound 1). The HT-1080.hPSMA model was used to study the saturation and tumor retention of Pluvicto (compound 2) and to run combination therapy studies with L19-IL2. To complement our understanding of the mechanism of action of this novel combination, we conducted proteomics experiments on tumor samples after therapy with Pluvicto alone or in combination with the immunocytokine. RESULTS: High, selective, and long-lived tumor uptake was observed for Pluvicto (2) in the novel HT-1080.hPSMA model. Therapy studies in HT-1080.hPSMA tumor-bearing mice revealed that the combination of Pluvicto (2) plus L19-IL2 mediated curative and durable responses in all animals. Potent in vivo anti-cancer activity was observed solely for the combination modality, at doses that were well tolerated by treated animals. Proteomics studies indicated that L19-IL2 boosts the activation of the immune system in animals pre-treated with Pluvicto. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic efficacy of Pluvicto at low radioactive doses can be effectively enhanced by the combination with L19-IL2. Our findings warrant further clinical exploration of this novel combination modality."
38562999,An androgen receptor-based signature to predict prognosis and identification of ORC1 as a therapeutical target for prostate adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a crucial role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and contributes significantly to the development of enzalutamide resistance. In this study, we aimed to identify a novel AR-driven signature that can predict prognosis and endows potentially reveal novel therapeutic targets for PRAD. METHODS: The Seurat package was used to preprocess the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes were visualized using limma and pheamap packages. LASSO and multi-variate Cox regression models were established using glmnet package. The package ""Consensus Cluster Plus"" was utilized to perform the consensus clustering analysis. The biological roles of origin recognition complex subunit 1 (ORC1) in PRAD were determined by gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo. RESULT: We characterized the scRNA-seq data from GSE99795 and identified 10 AR-associated genes (ARGs). The ARGs model was trained and validated in internal and external cohorts. The ARGs were identified as an independent hazard factor in PRAD and correlated with clinical risk characteristics. In addition, the ARGs were found to be correlated with somatic tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels. Two groups that have distinct prognostic and molecular features were identified through consensus clustering analysis. ORC1 was identified as a critical target among these ARGs, and it ORC1 promoted proliferation and stem-like properties of PRAD cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay confirmed that AR could directly bind the promoter of ORC1. Activated AR/ORC1 axis contributed to enzalutamide resistance, and targeting ORC1 rendered PRAD cells more susceptible to enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines an AR-driven signature that AR activates ORC1 expressions to promote PRAD progression and enzalutamide resistance, which may provide novel targets for PRAD treatment."
38562774,CDK12 Loss Promotes Prostate Cancer Development While Exposing Vulnerabilities to Paralog-Based Synthetic Lethality.,"Biallelic loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) defines a unique molecular subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It remains unclear, however, whether CDK12 loss per se is sufficient to drive prostate cancer development-either alone, or in the context of other genetic alterations-and whether CDK12-mutant tumors exhibit sensitivity to specific pharmacotherapies. Here, we demonstrate that tissue-specific Cdk12 ablation is sufficient to induce preneoplastic lesions and robust T cell infiltration in the mouse prostate. Allograft-based CRISPR screening demonstrated that Cdk12 loss is positively associated with Trp53 inactivation but negatively associated with Pten inactivation-akin to what is observed in human mCRPC. Consistent with this, ablation of Cdk12 in prostate organoids with concurrent Trp53 loss promotes their proliferation and ability to form tumors in mice, while Cdk12 knockout in the Pten-null prostate cancer mouse model abrogates tumor growth. Bigenic Cdk12 and Trp53 loss allografts represent a new syngeneic model for the study of androgen receptor (AR)-positive, luminal prostate cancer. Notably, Cdk12/Trp53 loss prostate tumors are sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. Cdk12-null organoids (either with or without Trp53 co-ablation) and patient-derived xenografts from tumors with CDK12 inactivation are highly sensitive to inhibition or degradation of its paralog kinase, CDK13. Together, these data identify CDK12 as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene with impact on tumor progression and lends support to paralog-based synthetic lethality as a promising strategy for treating CDK12-mutant mCRPC."
38562719,Redirecting the pioneering function of FOXA1 with covalent small molecules.,"Pioneer transcription factors (TFs) exhibit a specialized ability to bind to and open closed chromatin, facilitating engagement by other regulatory factors involved in gene activation or repression. Chemical probes are lacking for pioneer TFs, which has hindered their mechanistic investigation in cells. Here, we report the chemical proteomic discovery of electrophilic small molecules that stereoselectively and site-specifically bind the pioneer TF, FOXA1, at a cysteine (C258) within the forkhead DNA-binding domain. We show that these covalent ligands react with FOXA1 in a DNA-dependent manner and rapidly remodel its pioneer activity in prostate cancer cells reflected in redistribution of FOXA1 binding across the genome and directionally correlated changes in chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis supports a mechanism where the covalent ligands relax the canonical DNA binding preference of FOXA1 by strengthening interactions with suboptimal ancillary sequences in predicted proximity to C258. Our findings reveal a striking plasticity underpinning the pioneering function of FOXA1 that can be controlled by small molecules."
38555945,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Repairs Radiation Enteritis Through Modulating the Gut Microbiota-Mediated Tryptophan Metabolism.,"Radiation enteritis is a common complication of abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. Several previous studies showed that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could alleviate radiation enteritis. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of FMT in alleviating radiation enteritis and explored the mechanisms by multi-omics approaches. Briefly, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 9 Gy irradiation to the localized abdominal field, and randomized received FMT from healthy donor mice or saline. H&E staining of harvested small intestine showed FMT decreased epithelial injury. Radiation-induced microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by a decrease in beneficial bacteria Lactobacillaceae and Lachnospiraceae, while these bacteria were restored by FMT. Fecal metabolomics analysis revealed that FMT modulated metabolic dysregulation. Two tryptophan pathway metabolites, indole-3-acetaldehyde and N-Acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine were decreased after irradiation, whereas these metabolites showed a pronounced recovery in mice receiving FMT. Proteomics analysis of small intestine indicated that radiation enteritis triggered immune-inflammatory responses, which were potentially mitigated by FMT. In 21 patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy for cervical cancer, those who developed enteritis (n = 15) had higher abundance in Lachnospiraceae. Moreover, Indole-3-acetaldehyde was reduced after irradiation. These findings provide insights into the therapeutic effects of FMT in radiation enteritis and highlight Lachnospiraceae and the tryptophan metabolite, Indole-3-acetaldehyde may protect against radiation enteritis."
38554337,Prognostic microRNAs as biomarkers for prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer is the second largest cancer, most commonly diagnosed in men. Several studies reveal that miRNAs (microRNAs) are involved in various stages of prostate cancer. miRNAs are a family of small non-coding RNA species that have been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The present in silico study aims at identifying miRNA biomarkers that are significantly associated with the regulation of genes involved in prostate cancer. METHODS: Dataset of miRNA and mRNA of prostate adenocarcinoma patients and controls was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and differential gene expression analysis was carried out. ROC and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed on differentially expressed miRNAs. Pathway analysis was carried out for significant miRNAs, and protein-protein interaction of involved genes and miRNAs was examined. RESULTS: A total of 185 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the patients and the control. ROC and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the two miRNAs hsa-mir-133b and hsa-mir-17-5p were found to be significantly associated with prostate cancer prognosis. HAS2 and EPHA10 gene targets of identified miRNA were also differentially expressed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and the HAS2 gene was found to be interacting with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of hsa-mir-133b and hsa-mir-17-5p miRNAs as biomarkers for the prognosis of prostate cancer. However, further experimental studies are required to validate this finding."
38554103,The RNA secondary structure of androgen receptor-FL and V7 transcripts reveals novel regulatory regions.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor belonging to the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family. Due to its roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, AR is tightly regulated to maintain proper levels of itself and the many genes it controls. AR dysregulation is a driver of many human diseases including prostate cancer. Though this dysregulation often occurs at the RNA level, there are many unknowns surrounding post-transcriptional regulation of AR mRNA, particularly the role that RNA secondary structure plays. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of AR transcript secondary structure is needed. We address this through the computational and experimental analyses of two key isoforms, full length (AR-FL) and truncated (AR-V7). Here, a combination of in-cell RNA secondary structure probing experiments (targeted DMS-MaPseq) and computational predictions were used to characterize the static structural landscape and conformational dynamics of both isoforms. Additionally, in-cell assays were used to identify functionally relevant structures in the 5' and 3' UTRs of AR-FL. A notable example is a conserved stem loop structure in the 5'UTR of AR-FL that can bind to Poly(RC) Binding Protein 2 (PCBP2). Taken together, our results reveal novel features that regulate AR expression."
38552081,Associations between gut microbiota and gynecological cancers: A bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Growing evidence has suggested that gut microbiota is associated with gynecologic cancers. However, whether there is a causal relationship between these associations remains to be determined. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) evaluation was carried out to investigate the mechanism associating gut microbiota and 3 prevalent gynecological cancers, ovarian cancer (OC), endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer as well as their subtypes in individuals of European ancestry. The Genome-wide association studies statistics, which are publically accessible, were used. Eligible instrumental single nucleotide polymorphisms that were significantly related to the gut microbiota were selected. Multiple MR analysis approaches were carried out, including inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, Weighted Median methods, and a range of sensitivity analyses. Lastly, we undertook a reverse MR analysis to evaluate the potential of reverse causality. We sifted through 196 bacterial taxa and identified 33 suggestive causal relationships between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and gynecological cancers. We found that 11 of these genera could be pathogenic risk factors for gynecological cancers, while 19 could lessen the risk of cancer. In the other direction, gynecological cancers altered gut microbiota composition. Our MR analysis revealed that the gut microbiota was causally associated with OC, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer. This may assist in providing new insights for further mechanistic and clinical studies of microbiota-mediated gynecological cancer."
38550866,Microbiome markers in HPV-positive and HPV-negative women of reproductive age with ASCUS and SIL determined by V4 region of 16S rRNA gene sequencing.,"INTRODUCTION: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Cervicovaginal microbiota plays an important role in HPV infection and is associated with the development of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The natural history of cervical cancer involves reversible changes in the cervical tissue from a normal state, in which no neoplastic changes are detected in the squamous epithelium, to varying states of cellular abnormalities that ultimately lead to cervical cancer. Low-grade SIL (LSIL), like another cytological category - atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), may progress to high-grade SIL (HSIL) and invasive cervical cancer or may regress to a normal state. METHODS: In this work, we studied cervical canal microbiome in 165 HPV-positive and HPV-negative women of a reproductive age with ASCUS [HPV(+) n = 29; HPV(-) n = 11], LSIL [HPV(+) n = 32; HPV(-) n = 25], HSIL [HPV(+) n = 46], and the control group with negative for intraepithelial lesion malignancy (NILM) [HPV(-) n = 22]. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: HPV16 is the most prevalent HPV type. We have not found any differences between diversity in studied groups, but several genus [like Prevotella (p-value = 0.026), Gardnerella (p-value = 0.003), Fannyhessea (p-value = 0.024)] more often occurred in HSIL group compared by NILM or LSIL regardless of HPV. We have found statistically significant difference in occurrence or proportion of bacterial genus in studied groups. We also identified that increasing of the ratio of Lactobacillus iners or age of patient lead to higher chance to HSIL, while increasing of the ratio of Lactobacillus crispatus lead to higher chance to LSIL. Patients with a moderate dysbiosis equally often had either of three types of vaginal microbial communities (CST, Community State Type) with the prevalence of Lactobacillus crispatus (CST I), Lactobacillus gasseri (CST II), and Lactobacillus iners (CST III); whereas severe dysbiosis is linked with CST IV involving the microorganisms genera associated with bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis: Gardnerella, Fannyhessea, Dialister, Sneathia, Anaerococcus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, Finegoldia, Peptoniphilus, Porphyromonas, Parvimonas, and Streptococcus."
38550593,STING agonist inflames the cervical cancer immune microenvironment and overcomes anti-PD-1 therapy resistance.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer poses a significant global threat to women's health. However, current therapeutic interventions, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical resection, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, face limitations in the advanced stages of the disease. Given the immunosuppressive microenvironment in cervical cancer, it is imperative to explore novel perspectives. In this regard, STING agonists have emerged as promising candidates. METHODS: The expression profiles and clinicopathological data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Prognostic analysis of STING downstream genes (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10) and immune infiltration analysis were conducted using Kaplan-Meier Plotter, ESTIMATE, and deconvo_CIBERSOR. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential of MSA-2 in cervical cancer treatment employing SingleR, chi-squared test, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Cellular interaction analysis utilized the CellChat package to assess the potentiation of cellular interaction following MSA-2 administration. Murine tumor models involving U14 and TC-1, were conducted, and the IF of tissue was subsequently conducted to assess the tumor microenvironment status after treatment. RESULTS: Prognosis in cervical cancer correlated with elevated expression of STING downstream genes, indicating prolonged survival and reduced recurrence. These genes positively correlated with immune infiltration, influencing stromal scores, immune scores, and estimate scores. Specific immune cell populations, including CD8(+) T cells, M1-type macrophages, NK cells, and T follicular helper cells, were associated with STING downstream genes. scRNA-seq in a classic immune-excluded model revealed that MSA-2 exerts priming and activating functions on vital components within TME, and intensifies their intercellular communications. The in vivo assay ultimately demonstrated that MSA-2, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with anti-PD-1, effectively suppressed the growth of subcutaneous cervical tumors. Moreover, the combination strategy significantly augmented efficacy compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy by eliciting a robust antitumor immune response. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the pivotal role of the STING pathway and the potential of MSA-2 in reshaping the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer. Combining MSA-2 with immune checkpoint inhibitors presents a transformative approach, holding promise for improved prognosis. Further investigations are warranted to explore the broader immune landscape and potential long-term effects of MSA-2 in cervical cancer treatment."
38547495,Role of body mass index and weight change in the risk of cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 66 cohort studies.,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of body mass index (BMI) and weight change on the risk of developing cancer overall and cancer at different sites. METHODS: We searched PubMed and other databases up to July 2023 using the keywords related to 'risk', 'cancer', 'weight', 'overweight', and 'obesity'. We identified eligible studies, and the inclusion criteria encompassed cohort studies in English that focused on cancer diagnosis and included BMI or weight change as an exposure factor. Multiple authors performed data extraction and quality assessment, and statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan and R software. We used random- or fixed-effects models to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. RESULTS: Analysis included 66 cohort studies. Compared to underweight or normal weight, overweight or obesity was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, and liver cancer but a decreased risk of prostate cancer and lung cancer. Being underweight was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer and lung cancer but not that of postmenopausal breast cancer or female reproductive cancer. In addition, weight loss of more than five kg was protective against overall cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obesity increase the risk of most cancers, and weight loss of >5 kg reduces overall cancer risk. These findings provide insights for cancer prevention and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cancer development. REGISTRATION: Reviewregistry1786."
38547422,Toward Informed Selection and Interpretation of Clinical Genomic Tests in Prostate Cancer.,"Clinical genomic testing of patient germline, tumor tissue, or plasma cell-free DNA can enable a personalized approach to cancer management and treatment. In prostate cancer (PCa), broad genotyping tests are now widely used to identify germline and/or somatic alterations in BRCA2 and other DNA damage repair genes. Alterations in these genes can confer cancer sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, are linked with poor prognosis, and can have potential hereditary cancer implications for family members. However, there is huge variability in genomic tests and reporting standards, meaning that for successful implementation of testing in clinical practice, end users must carefully select the most appropriate test for a given patient and critically interpret the results. In this white paper, we outline key pre- and post-test considerations for choosing a genomic test and evaluating reported variants, specifically for patients with advanced PCa. Test choice must be based on clinical context and disease state, availability and suitability of tumor tissue, and the genes and regions that are covered by the test. We describe strategies to recognize false positives or negatives in test results, including frameworks to assess low tumor fraction, subclonal alterations, clonal hematopoiesis, and pathogenic versus nonpathogenic variants. We assume that improved understanding among health care professionals and researchers of the nuances associated with genomic testing will ultimately lead to optimal patient care and clinical decision making."
38547419,Real-World Overall Survival and Treatment Patterns by PTEN Status in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE: It is estimated that the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is functionally lost in 40%-50% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). There is limited information on the prognostic significance of PTEN status identified with genomic testing. This real-world cohort study assessed PTEN as a genetic biomarker using data from US-based oncology practices. METHODS: This retrospective real-world cohort study used a deidentified US-based metastatic prostate cancer clinicogenomic database linked to longitudinal clinical data derived from electronic health records. Patients were aged 18 years and older and diagnosed with mCRPC between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2021. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of tumor specimens was performed using next-generation sequencing. First-line (1L) and second-line (2L) treatment patterns were assessed and stratified by PTEN status. Kaplan-Meier methods and a multivariable Cox model were used to compare the real-world overall survival by PTEN status among patients who received 1L novel hormone therapy or taxanes. RESULTS: In patients with mCRPC who underwent CGP, PTEN loss of function (LOF) was associated with decreased survival compared with intact PTEN (hazard ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.42]; P = .024). The results were not influenced by 1L treatment type. 1L treatment patterns were similar between intact PTEN and PTEN LOF subgroups, with abiraterone and enzalutamide being the two most common treatments in both groups. Patients with PTEN LOF were less likely to receive 2L treatments than patients with intact PTEN. CONCLUSION: PTEN LOF, identified with genomic testing, was associated with decreased survival and negative prognoses in patients with mCRPC."
38544834,Mapping breast and prostate cancer in the Brazilian public health system: study protocol of the Onco-Genomas Brasil.,"BACKGROUND: Breast and prostate cancers are the most common malignancies diagnosed in women and men respectively, and present with great clinical heterogeneity, even in tumors with the same histology and same site of origin. Somatic and germline molecular alterations in DNA may have prognostic and predictive impact, influencing response to therapies and overall survival. Our aim is to characterize the somatic and germline genomic landscape of women with locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer and men with metastatic prostate cancer in Brazil. Secondarily, we aim to identify genetic variants associated with tumor prognosis and treatment response, identify patients carrying pathogenic alterations in cancer-predisposing genes, and characterize the genetic ancestry of the population included in the study. METHODS: This observational multicenter cohort study will include 550 adult patients from the five macro-regions of Brazil, divided into two arms: 1) breast cancer and 2) prostate cancer. Clinical and pathological data will be collected, as well as DNA samples from peripheral blood and tumor samples. In arm 1, the inclusion criteria are a histological diagnosis of breast carcinoma with overexpression of HER-2, clinical stage II or III, and current neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. In arm 2, the criterion is a histological diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, clinical stage IV. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) will be performed to identify variants that may be drivers and/or actionable in a specific patient or tumor. These variants will be interpreted and classified according to their population frequencies, in silico predictors, functional studies, and literature data, following international guidelines proposed by expert societies. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to the construction of a robust database that should provide a better understanding of the genomic profile of patients with breast and prostate cancer in Brazil. Considering the miscegenation of the Brazilian population, knowledge generated from these data will have implications for future studies of this specific population.

38544686,Causal relationship between Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Previous observational researchers have found an inverse bidirectional link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prostate cancer (PCa); yet, the causative nature of this link remains unclear. To investigate the causal interactions between AD and PCa, a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted. METHODS: This study comprised two Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics for AD (17,008 cases and 37,154 controls) and PCa (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls) in individuals of European ancestry. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the primary approach, while MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode served as supplementary methods for estimating the causal effect. To assess pleiotropy, the MR-PRESSO global test and MR-Egger regression were used. Cochran's Q test was adopted to check heterogeneity, MR Steiger test and the leave-one-out analysis was performed to confirm the robustness and reliability of the results. RESULTS: The causal association genetically inferred of AD on PCa was found using IVW (OR = 0.974, 95% CI = 0.958-0.991, p = 0.003) in forward MR analysis and the causal association genetically inferred of PCa on AD was not found using IVW (OR = 1.000, 95% CI: 0.954-1.049, P = 0.988) in reverse MR analysis. The sensitivity analysis showed that no pleiotropy and heterogeneity was observed. The leave-one-out analysis showed that the findings were not inordinately affected by any instrumental variables. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated an absence of bidirectional causality between AD and PCa among the European population, suggested that a genetically predicted possibility of decreased PCa risk in AD patients, and no significant genetically predicted causal effect of PCa on AD."
38544351,Quantification and molecular correlates of tertiary lymphoid structures in primary prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To morphologically describe tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in prostatectomy specimens and correlate them with clinical and transcriptomic features. METHODOLOGY: A total of 72 consecutive cases of entirely submitted radical prostatectomy (RP) patients tested with the Decipher Genomic Classifier were included in the study. Images were manually annotated using QuPath tools to denote tumor regions and each cluster of TLS. Clusters of lymphocytes that were surrounded on all four sides by tumor were defined as intra-tumor TLS (IT-TLS). Clusters of lymphocytes at the leading edge of carcinoma with either the prostatic pseudocapsule or benign parenchyma at one end were defined as peri-tumor TLS (PT-TLS). A classification algorithm to distinguish lymphocytes from non-lymphocytic cells using a supervised machine learning model was used. The associations between TLS formation and 265 gene expression-based signatures were examined. RESULTS: The magnitude of total TLS correlations with primary tumor gene expression signatures was moderate (~0.35-0.5) with several HLA, T-cell and B-cell Cluster signatures, showing positive correlation with various metrics for quantification of TLS. On the other hand, immune suppressive signatures (Treg, MDSC) were negatively correlated. While signatures for macrophages, NK cells and other immune cell types were uncorrelated for the most part. PT-TLS was associated with MHC signatures while IT TLS correlated with MHC and T-cell signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of inflammatory cells in the RP specimen can be divided spatially into PT TLS and IT-TLS, each with its unique molecular correlates of tumor immune microenvironment. The presence of TLS is positively correlated with MHC signatures, T- cell and B-cell cluster signatures but, negatively correlated with immune suppressive signatures. A subset of prostate cancer demonstrate a robust inflammatory response, and warrant further characterization in larger cohorts."
38542265,Microbiome Dysbiosis Is Associated with Castration Resistance and Cancer Stemness in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in males in America, with advanced prostate cancers exhibiting a 5-year survival rate of only 32%. Castration resistance often develops during the course of treatment, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. This study explores the human microbiome for its implications in castration resistance and metastasis in prostate cancer. RNA sequencing data were downloaded for the bone and soft tissue biopsies of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These included both metastatic and adjacent normal biopsies. These sequences were mapped to bacterial sequences, yielding species-level counts. A vast majority of species were found to be significantly underabundant in the CRPC samples. Of these, numerous were found to correlate with the expression of known markers of castration resistance, including AR, PI3K, and AKT. Castration resistance-associated signaling pathways were also enriched with these species, including PI3K-AKT signaling and endocrine resistance. For their implications in cancer aggression and metastasis, cancer stem cell markers were further explored for a relation to these species. EGFR and SLC3A2 were widely downregulated, with a greater abundance of most species. Our results suggest that the microbiome is heavily associated with castration resistance and stemness in prostate cancer. By considering the microbiome's importance in these factors, we may better understand the highly aggressive and highly invasive nature of castration-resistant prostate cancer, allowing for the needed improvements in the treatment of this disease."
38540414,A POT1 Founder Variant Associated with Early Onset Recurrent Melanoma and Various Solid Malignancies.,"POT1 (Protection of Telomeres 1) is a key component of the six-membered shelterin complex that plays a critical role in telomere protection and length regulation. Germline variants in the POT1 gene have been implicated in predisposition to cancer, primarily to melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We report the identification of POT1 p.(I78T), previously ranked with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity, as a founder pathogenic variant among Ashkenazi Jews (AJs) and describe its unique clinical landscape. A directed database search was conducted for individuals referred for genetic counselling from 2018 to 2023. Demographic, clinical, genetic, and pathological data were collected and analyzed. Eleven carriers, 25 to 67 years old, from ten apparently unrelated families were identified. Carriers had a total of 30 primary malignancies (range 1-6); nine carriers (82%) had recurrent melanoma between the ages of 25 and 63 years, three carriers (27%) had desmoid tumors, three (27%) had papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and five women (63% of female carriers) had breast cancer between the ages of 44 and 67 years. Additional tumors included CLL; sarcomas; endocrine tumors; prostate, urinary, and colorectal cancers; and colonic polyps. A review of a local exome database yielded an allelic frequency of the variant of 0.06% among all ethnicities and of 0.25% in AJs. A shared haplotype was found in all carriers tested. POT1 p.(I78T) is a founder disease-causing variant associated with early-onset melanoma and additional various solid malignancies with a high tumor burden. We advocate testing for this variant in high-risk patients of AJ descent. The inclusion of POT1 in germline panels for various types of cancer is warranted."
38539538,Immunoprofiles and Oncologic Outcomes of 15 Patients with Androgen Receptor-Positive Salivary Duct Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Salivary duct carcinomas (SDC) are a rare and aggressive subtype of salivary gland neoplasm. They can present with distinct immunoprofiles, such as androgen receptor (AR) and HER-2/Neu-positivity. To date, no consensus exists on how to best manage this entity. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic AR+ SDC of the parotid from 2013 to 2019 treated with curative intent were included. Immunologic tumor profiling was conducted using 24 distinct markers. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant control, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included. Nine (60%) patients presented with T4 disease and eight (53%) had positive ipsilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Ten (67%) patients underwent trimodality therapy, including surgery followed by adjuvant radiation and concurrent systemic therapy. The median follow-up was 5.5 years (interquartile range, 4.8-6.1). The estimated 5-year rates of LRR, distant progression, and OS were 6%, 13%, and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite only including AR+ SDC of the parotid, immunoprofiles, such as expression of HER-2, were highly variable, highlighting the potential to tailor systemic regimens based on individual histologic profiles in the future. Studies with larger patient numbers using tumor-specific molecular profiling and tumor heterogeneity analyses are justified to better understand the biology of these tumors. Molecularly informed treatment approaches, including the potential use of AR- and HER-2/Neu-directed therapies upfront in the definitive setting, may hold future promise to further improve outcomes for these patients."
38538606,New role of fat-free mass in cancer risk linked with genetic predisposition.,"Cancer risk is associated with the widely debated measure body mass index (BMI). Fat mass and fat-free mass measurements from bioelectrical impedance may further clarify this association. The UK Biobank is a rare resource in which bioelectrical impedance and BMI data was collected on ~ 500,000 individuals. Using this dataset, a comprehensive analysis using regression, principal component and genome-wide genetic association, provided multiple levels of evidence that increasing whole body fat (WBFM) and fat-free mass (WBFFM) are both associated with increased post-menopausal breast cancer risk, and colorectal cancer risk in men. WBFM was inversely associated with prostate cancer. We also identified rs615029[T] and rs1485995[G] as associated in independent analyses with both PMBC (p = 1.56E-17 and 1.78E-11) and WBFFM (p = 2.88E-08 and 8.24E-12), highlighting splice variants of the intriguing long non-coding RNA CUPID1 (LINC01488) as a potential link between PMBC risk and fat-free mass."
38534951,Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate with Novel Genetic Alterations Characterized by Next-Generation Sequencing.,"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate (DAP) is an uncommon variant of prostate cancer associated with aggressive disease and poor outcome. It presents most frequently as a mixed tumor combined with acinar adenocarcinoma. Although the histopathological features of DAP are well known, its genomic characteristics are still evolving, prompting the suggestion that all DAP would benefit from molecular analysis with the purpose of improving tumor recognition, genetic classification, and, ultimately, personalized therapy. Herein, we report a case of DAP with novel genetic alterations (BCOR P1153S, ERG M219I, KDR A750E, POLE S1896P, and RAD21 T461del)."
38534919,Review on the Role of BRCA Mutations in Genomic Screening and Risk Stratification of Prostate Cancer.,"(1) Background: Somatic and germline alterations can be commonly found in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. The aim of our present study was to perform a comprehensive review of the current literature in order to examine the impact of BRCA mutations in the context of PCa as well as their significance as genetic biomarkers. (2) Methods: A narrative review of all the available literature was performed. Only ""landmark"" publications were included. (3) Results: Overall, the number of PCa patients who harbor a BRCA2 mutation range between 1.2% and 3.2%. However, BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutations are responsible for most cases of hereditary PCa, increasing the risk by 3-8.6 times and up to 4 times, respectively. These mutations are correlated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Gene testing should be offered to patients with metastatic PCa, those with 2-3 first-degree relatives with PCa, or those aged < 55 and with one close relative with breast (age </= 50 years) or invasive ovarian cancer. (4) Conclusions: The individualized assessment of BRCA mutations is an important tool for the risk stratification of PCa patients. It is also a population screening tool which can guide our risk assessment strategies and achieve better results for our patients and their families."
38534761,Genetic Signatures for Distinguishing Chemo-Sensitive from Chemo-Resistant Responders in Prostate Cancer Patients.,"Prostate cancer remains a significant public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly impacting South Africa with high mortality rates. Despite many years of extensive research and significant financial expenditure, there has yet to be a definitive solution to prostate cancer. It is not just individuals who vary in their response to treatment, but even different nodules within the same tumor exhibit unique transcriptome patterns. These distinctions extend beyond mere differences in gene expression levels to encompass the control and networking of individual genes. Escalating chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer patients has prompted increased research into its underlying mechanisms. The heterogeneous nature of transcriptomic organization among men makes the pursuit of universal biomarkers and one-size-fits-all treatments impractical. This study delves into the expression of drug resistance-associated genes, ABCB1 and CYP1B1, in cancer cells. Employing bioinformatics, we explored the molecular pathways and cascades linked to drug resistance following upregulation of these genes. Samples were obtained from archived prostate cancer patient specimens through pre-treatment biopsies of two categories: good vs. poor responders, with cDNAs synthesized from isolated RNAs subjected to qPCR analysis. The results revealed increased ABCB1 and CYP1B1 expression in tumor samples of the poor responders. Gene enrichment and network analysis associated ABCB1 with ABC transporters and LncRNA-mediated therapeutic resistance (WP3672), while CYP1B1 was linked to ovarian steroidogenesis, tryptophan metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, benzo(a)pyrene metabolism, the sulindac metabolic pathway, and the estrogen receptor pathway, which are associated with drug resistance. Both ABCB1 and CYP1B1 correlated with microRNAs in cancer and the Nuclear Receptors Meta-Pathway. STRING analysis predicted protein-protein interactions of ABCB1 and CYP1B1 with Glutathione S-transferase Pi, Catechol O-methyltransferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-6, Leucine-rich Transmembrane and O-methyltransferase (LRTOMT), and Epoxide hydrolase 1, with scores of 0.973, 0.971, 0.966, 0.966, and 0.966, respectively. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis of the chemotherapy drug, docetaxel, with CYP1B1 and ABCB1 revealed robust molecular interactions, with binding energies of -20.37 and -15.25 Kcal/mol, respectively. These findings underscore the susceptibility of cancer patients to drug resistance due to increased ABCB1 and CYP1B1 expression in tumor samples from patients in the poor-responders category that affects associated molecular pathways. The potent molecular interactions of ABCB1 and CYP1B1 with docetaxel further emphasize the potential basis for chemotherapy resistance."
38534445,A Cyclic Permutation Approach to Removing Spatial Dependency between Clustered Gene Ontology Terms.,"Traditional gene set enrichment analysis falters when applied to large genomic domains, where neighboring genes often share functions. This spatial dependency creates misleading enrichments, mistaking mere physical proximity for genuine biological connections. Here we present Spatial Adjusted Gene Ontology (SAGO), a novel cyclic permutation-based approach, to tackle this challenge. SAGO separates enrichments due to spatial proximity from genuine biological links by incorporating the genes' spatial arrangement into the analysis. We applied SAGO to various datasets in which the identified genomic intervals are large, including replication timing domains, large H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains, HiC compartments and lamina-associated domains (LADs). Intriguingly, applying SAGO to prostate cancer samples with large copy number alteration (CNA) domains eliminated most of the enriched GO terms, thus helping to accurately identify biologically relevant gene sets linked to oncogenic processes, free from spatial bias."
38529542,The antiviral potential of the antiandrogen enzalutamide and the viral-androgen signaling interplay in seasonal coronaviruses.,"The sex disparity in COVID-19 outcomes with males generally faring worse than females has been associated with the androgen-regulated expression of the protease TMPRSS2 and the cell receptor ACE2 in the lung and fueled interest in antiandrogens as potential antivirals. In this study, we explored enzalutamide, an antiandrogen used commonly to treat prostate cancer, as a potential antiviral against the human coronaviruses which cause seasonal respiratory infections (HCoV-NL63, -229E, and -OC43). Using lentivirus-pseudotyped and authentic HCoV, we report that enzalutamide reduced 229E and NL63 entry and infection in both TMPRSS2- and nonexpressing immortalized cells, suggesting a TMPRSS2-independent mechanism. However, no effect was observed against OC43. To decipher this distinction, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis on 229E- and OC43-infected primary human airway cells. Our results show a significant induction of androgen-responsive genes by 229E compared to OC43 at 24 and 72 h postinfection. The virus-mediated effect on AR-signaling was further confirmed with a consensus androgen response element-driven luciferase assay in androgen-depleted MRC-5 cells. Specifically, 229E induced luciferase-reporter activity in the presence and absence of the synthetic androgen mibolerone, while OC43 inhibited induction. These findings highlight a complex interplay between viral infections and androgen-signaling, offering insights for disparities in viral outcomes and antiviral interventions."
38529474,PAD-mediated citrullination is a novel candidate diagnostic marker and druggable target for HPV-associated cervical cancer.,"Citrullination is an emerging post-translational modification catalyzed by peptidyl-arginine deiminases (PADs) that convert peptidyl-arginine into peptidyl-citrulline. In humans, the PAD family consists of five isozymes (PADs 1-4, 6) involved in multiple diseases, including cancer. Given that high-risk (hr) human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiological agents of cervical cancer, in this study, we sought to determine whether PAD-mediated protein citrullination would play a functional role in the HPV-driven transformation of epithelial cells. Here we show that both total protein citrullination and PAD4 expression levels are significantly associated with cervical cancer progression. Specifically, epithelial immunostaining for PAD4 revealed an increasingly higher histoscore from low-grade (CIN1) to high-grade (CIN2, CIN3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions, raising the attractive possibility that PAD4 may be used as tumor staging markers. Furthermore, taking advantage of the epidermoid cervical cancer cell line CaSki, which harbors multiple copies of the integrated HPV16 genome, we show that the expression of E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins is impaired by treatment with the pharmacological pan-PAD inhibitor BB-Cl-amidine. Consistently, p53 and p21, two targets of HPV oncoproteins, are upregulated by the PAD inhibitor, which undergoes cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Altogether, these findings highlight a novel mechanism by which hrHPVs alter host regulatory pathways involved in cell cycle and survival to gain viral fitness, raising the possibility that PADs may represent an attractive target for developing novel host-targeting antivirals effective in preventing cervical cancer progression."

38528230,Integration of polygenic and gut metagenomic risk prediction for common diseases.,"Multiomics has shown promise in noninvasive risk profiling and early detection of various common diseases. In the present study, in a prospective population-based cohort with ~18 years of e-health record follow-up, we investigated the incremental and combined value of genomic and gut metagenomic risk assessment compared with conventional risk factors for predicting incident coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer disease and prostate cancer. We found that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improved prediction over conventional risk factors for all diseases. Gut microbiome scores improved predictive capacity over baseline age for CAD, T2D and prostate cancer. Integrated risk models of PRSs, gut microbiome scores and conventional risk factors achieved the highest predictive performance for all diseases studied compared with models based on conventional risk factors alone. The present study demonstrates that integrated PRSs and gut metagenomic risk models improve the predictive value over conventional risk factors for common chronic diseases."
38527997,"Phenome-wide Mendelian randomisation analysis of 378,142 cases reveals risk factors for eight common cancers.","For many cancers there are only a few well-established risk factors. Here, we use summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Mendelian randomisation (MR) phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify potentially causal relationships for over 3,000 traits. Our outcome datasets comprise 378,142 cases across breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, endometrial, oesophageal, renal, and ovarian cancers, as well as 485,715 controls. We complement this analysis by systematically mining the literature space for supporting evidence. In addition to providing supporting evidence for well-established risk factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, lack of physical activity), we also find sex steroid hormones, plasma lipids, and telomere length as determinants of cancer risk. A number of the molecular factors we identify may prove to be potential biomarkers. Our analysis, which highlights aetiological similarities and differences in common cancers, should aid public health prevention strategies to reduce cancer burden. We provide a R/Shiny app to visualise findings."
38525718,"Tissue-Based Genomic Testing in Prostate Cancer: 10-Year Analysis of National Trends on the Use of Prolaris, Decipher, ProMark, and Oncotype DX.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) management is moving towards patient-tailored strategies. Advances in molecular and genetic profiling of tumor tissues, integrated with clinical risk assessments, provide deeper insights into disease aggressiveness. This study aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the pivotal genomic tests supporting PCa treatment decisions, analyzing-through real-world data-trends in their use and the growth of supporting literature evidence. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the extensive PearlDiver Mariner database, which contains de-identified patient records, in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were employed to identify patients diagnosed with PCa during the study period-2011 to 2021. We determined the utilization of primary tissue-based genetic tests (Oncocyte DX((R)), Prolaris((R)), Decipher((R)), and ProMark((R))) across all patients diagnosed with PCa. Subsequently, within the overall PCa cohort, patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and received genetic testing postoperatively were identified. The yearly distribution of these tests and the corresponding trends were illustrated with graphs. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,561,203 patients with a PCa diagnosis were recorded. Of these, 20,748 underwent tissue-based genetic testing following diagnosis, representing 1.3% of the total cohort. An increasing trend was observed in the use of all genetic tests. Linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant increase over time in the use of individual tests (all p-values < 0.05). Among the patients who underwent RP, 3076 received genetic analysis following surgery, representing 1.27% of this group. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates a growing trend in the utilization of tissue-based genomic testing for PCa. Nevertheless, they are utilized in less than 2% of PCa patients, whether at initial diagnosis or after surgical treatment. Although it is anticipated that their use may increase as more scientific evidence becomes available, their role requires further elucidation."
38525428,Case report: Exceptional and durable response to Radium-223 and suspension of androgen deprivation therapy in a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patient.,"Despite the development of new therapies in the last few years, metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is still a lethal disease. Radium-223 (Ra-223) is approved for patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases and no visceral disease. However, patients' outcomes are heterogenous, and there is lack of validated predictive biomarkers of response, while biomarkers for early identification of patients who benefit from treatment are limited. This case report describes a remarkable and durable response to Ra-223 in a CRPC patient with bone metastases who had rapidly progressed to many previous therapies; this response is now lasting for 5 years even after having stopped backbone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we present the clinical course of this exceptional response, as well as comprehensive genomic and histopathology analyses on sequential biopsies acquired before and after therapy. Additionally, we review current knowledge on predictive and response biomarkers to Ra-223 in metastatic prostate cancer."
38524658,Significant reduction in burden of metastatic disease by intermittent docetaxel therapy in a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Intermittent docetaxel therapy (IDT) is rarely used nowadays as a treatment option for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) because of the widespread availability of androgen receptor axis-targeted therapy, which is less toxic. Therefore, there is limited information available on whether IDT has a clinical benefit in the treatment of men with mCRPC. This report describes the case of a 66-year-old man with a diagnosis of cT2N1M0 prostate cancer who underwent neoadjuvant combined androgen blockade and whole-pelvis radiation therapy. However, the tumor had progressed to mCRPC with metastasis to the bladder and a left pelvic lymph node within 2 years. Docetaxel had been administered as first-line chemotherapy, and the patient achieved a complete response in terms of the bladder metastasis. Docetaxel was stopped after 15 cycles. When a durable response had been maintained for more than 2 years, during which only androgen deprivation therapy was administered, the patient was switched to observation only. However, his prostate-specific antigen level gradually increased. Abiraterone was started as second-line therapy, during which there was a rapid increase in the PSA level. Computed tomography revealed further enlargement of the left pelvic lymph node, bladder metastasis, metastasis to the left common iliac lymph nodes, and several disseminated nodules around the bladder. Docetaxel was reintroduced as IDT for third-line therapy, and a complete response was achieved for all metastases, with the exception of the metastasis in the left pelvic lymph node. Thus far, the patient has survived for more than 7 years after starting docetaxel as first-line therapy for mCRPC. IDT is potentially useful in a subgroup of patients with mCRPC and could achieve long-term survival. Comprehensive genomic profiling may help physicians to select patients with mCRPC who are more likely to benefit from docetaxel than other systemic therapy."
38523927,"Role of microRNA in Sex Steroid Hormones Signaling and Its Effect in Regulation of Endometrial, Ovarian, and Cervical Cancer: A Literature Review.","Worldwide, in 2020, an estimated 417,367 people were diagnosed with uterine cancer. Endometrial cancer accounts for more than 90% of all uterine cancers. The 15th most frequent cancer overall and the sixth most frequent cancer in women is endometrial cancer. Global ovarian cancer Incidence was diagnosed estimated at 313,959 new cases worldwide in 2020. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in women worldwide. It has been demonstrated that sex steroid hormones (SSHs) have an essential role in regulating the susceptibility of cancer to cytotoxic therapy. Dysregulation of DNA repair contributes to genomic instability, aberrant cell survival, and cancer development as well as therapy resistance. Several crucial DNA repair components have been discovered to interact with the three main SSHs: androgen, estrogen, and progesterone. MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation has been associated with aberrant sex steroid hormone signaling as well as an increased risk of endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancer. The expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors is modulated by a number of miRNAs, and it has been demonstrated that the miRNA expression profile may predict the way a patient would respond to hormone therapy. Additionally, particular miRNAs have been linked to the control of genes involved in signaling pathways connected to hormones. Recent research has shown that miRNAs can modify hormone signaling pathways and affect the expression of sex steroid hormone receptors. Our goal in this literature review is to present an overview of current knowledge regarding the role of miRNAs in cancers regulated by sex steroid hormone pathways, as well as to identify particular miRNA targets for hormonal therapy."
38523457,"Firefighting, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and DNA methylation of genes associated with prostate cancer risk.","Prostate cancer is the leading incident cancer among men in the United States. Firefighters are diagnosed with this disease at a rate 1.21 times higher than the average population. This increased risk may result from occupational exposures to many toxicants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This study assessed the association between firefighting as an occupation in general or PFAS serum levels, with DNA methylation. Only genomic regions previously linked to prostate cancer risk were selected for analysis: GSTP1, Alu repetitive elements, and the 8q24 chromosomal region. There were 444 male firefighters included in this study, with some analyses being conducted on fewer participants due to missingness. Statistical models were used to test associations between exposures and DNA methylation at CpG sites in the selected genomic regions. Exposure variables included proxies of cumulative firefighting exposures (incumbent versus academy status and years of firefighting experience) and biomarkers of PFAS exposures (serum concentrations of 9 PFAS). Proxies of cumulative exposures were associated with DNA methylation at 15 CpG sites and one region located within FAM83A (q-value <0.1). SbPFOA was associated with 19 CpG sites (q < 0.1), but due to low detection rates, this PFAS was modeled as detected versus not detected in serum. Overall, there is evidence that firefighting experience is associated with differential DNA methylation in prostate cancer risk loci, but this study did not find evidence that these differences are due to PFAS exposures specifically."
38523292,SGLT2 inhibition and three urological cancers: Up-to-date results.,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the causal role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition on three urological cancers. METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the expression level of SLC5A2, a proxy for SGLT2 inhibition, from a recent publication were extracted. Three common urological cancers, including bladder cancer, prostate cancer and kidney cancer, were analysed. The main cohort of bladder cancer was derived from UK Biobank (1279 cases and 372,016 controls). The prostate cancer cohort was from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls). The kidney cancer phenotype was from the UK Biobank cohort of 463,010 individuals (1114 cases and 461,896 controls). Primary and sensitivity analysis were performed to validate the results. In vitro analysis was also incorporated to validate the Mendelian randomisation results. RESULTS: In primary analysis, SGLT2 inhibition was associated with reduced risk of bladder cancer (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) per unit lowering of HbA1c level. A protective association was also observed for prostate cancer with odds ratio = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.21-0.47). However, we did not discover a causal relationship between SGLT2 inhibition and kidney cancer (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00). Sensitivity analysis and in vitro validation did not support the causal role of SGLT2 inhibition in increasing cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find any evidence that SGLT2 inhibition could increase the risk of the three cancers. Even in some analysis, SGLT2 inhibition tended to show protective effects on the three urological cancers."
38522124,Amplification of different satellite-DNAs in prostate cancer.,"In various solid tumors and corresponding cell lines, prior research has identified acquired copy number variations (CNVs) encompassing centromeric satellite-DNA sequences. This observation emerged from the application of centromeric probes (satellite-DNA) as controls in molecular cytogenetic investigations and diagnostics, although these accounts were largely anecdotal. In this study, we conducted a systematic screening for satellite-DNA sequence amplification in 31 prostate cancer (PCa) samples, a prevalent malignancy in men characterized by discernible molecular cytogenetic aberrations. Notably, PCa-typical genetic aberrations, such as TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangements and PTEN deletion, were identified in 12 and 6 out of the 31 PCa samples, respectively. Overall, PCa exhibited genomic instability marked by chromosomal gain or loss of signals across nearly all tested satellite-DNA regions, with particular emphasis on the Y-chromosome (18/31 cases). Remarkably, 5/12 PCa samples representing more advanced metastatic cancer displayed amplification of one or two satellite DNA stretches each, being detectable as blocks analogous to homogenously staining regions. Notably, these stretches included alpha-satellite DNA derived from chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 15, and 20, as well as satellite-III DNAs (D1Z1 and DYZ1). These findings align with recent discoveries indicating that alpha-satellite DNAs are expressed as long-non-coding RNAs in advanced cancer, particularly in the context of PCa."
38520912,Development of a novel prostate Cancer-Stroma Sphere (CSS) model for In Vitro tumor microenvironment studies.,"Tumor employs non-cancerous cells to gain beneficial features that promote growth and survival of cancer cells. Despite intensive research in the area of tumor microenvironment, there is still a lack of reliable and reproducible in vitro model for tumor and tumor-microenvironment cell interaction studies. Herein we report the successful development of a heterogeneous cancer-stroma sphere (CSS) model composed of prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells and immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The CSS model demonstrated a structured spatial layout of the cells, with stromal cells concentrated at the center of the spheres and tumor cells located on the periphery. Significant increase in the levels of VEGFA, IL-10, and IL1a has been detected in the conditioned media of CSS as compared to PC3 spheres. Single cell RNA sequencing data revealed that VEGFA was secreted by MSC cells within heterogeneous spheroids. Enhanced expression of extracellular membrane (ECM) proteins was also shown for CSS-derived MSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the multicellular architecture altered cancer cell response to chemotherapeutic agents: the inhibition of sphere formation by topotecan was 74.92 +/- 4.56 % for PC3 spheres and 45.95 +/- 7.84 % for CSS spheres (p < 0.01), docetaxel showed 37,51+/- 20,88 % and 15,67+/- 14,08 % inhibition, respectively (p < 0.05). Thus, CSS present an effective in vitro model for examining the extracellular matrix composition and cell-to-cell interactions within the tumor, as well as for evaluating the antitumor activity of drugs."
38520217,"MAOB expression correlates with a favourable prognosis in prostate cancer, and its genetic variants are associated with the metastasis of the disease.","Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), a neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme, was reported to reveal conflicting roles in various cancers. However, the functional role of MAOB and impacts of its genetic variants on prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown. Herein, we genotyped four loci of MAOB single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs1799836 (A/G), rs3027452 (G/A), rs6651806 (A/C) and rs6324 (G/A) in 702 PCa Taiwanese patients. We discovered that PCa patients carrying the MAOB rs6324 A-allele exhibited an increased risk of having a high initial prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) level (>10 ng/mL). Additionally, patients with the rs3027452 A-allele had a higher risk of developing distal metastasis, particularly in the subpopulation with high iPSA levels. In a subpopulation without postoperative biochemical recurrence, patients carrying the rs1799836 G-allele had a higher risk of developing lymph node metastasis and recurrence compared to those carrying the A-allele. Furthermore, genotype screening in PCa cell lines revealed that cells carrying the rs1799836 G-allele expressed lower MAOB levels than those carrying the A-allele. Functionally, overexpression and knockdown of MAOB in PCa cells respectively suppressed and enhanced cell motility and proliferation. In clinical observations, correlations of lower MAOB expression levels with higher Gleason scores, advanced clinical T stages, tumour metastasis, and poorer prognosis in PCa patients were noted. Our findings suggest that MAOB may act as a suppressor of PCa progression, and the rs3027452 and rs1799836 genetic variants of MAOB are linked to PCa metastasis within the Taiwanese population."
38517354,Hijacking and rewiring of host CircRNA/miRNA/mRNA competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks by oncoviruses during development of viral cancers.,"A significant portion of human cancers are caused by oncoviruses (12%-25%). Oncoviruses employ various strategies to promote their replication and induce tumourigenesis in host cells, one of which involves modifying the gene expression patterns of the host cells, leading to the rewiring of genes and resulting in significant changes in cellular processes and signalling pathways. In recent studies, a specific mode of gene regulation known as circular RNA (circRNA)-mediated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks has emerged as a key player in this context. CircRNAs, a class of non-coding RNA molecules, can interact with other RNA molecules, such as mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), through a process known as ceRNA crosstalk. This interaction occurs when circRNAs, acting as sponges, sequester miRNAs, thereby preventing them from binding to their target mRNAs and modulating their expression. By rewiring the host cell genome, oncoviruses have the ability to manipulate the expression and activity of circRNAs, thereby influencing the ceRNA networks that can profoundly impact cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses. This review focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of the latest findings on the involvement of virus-induced reprogramming of host circRNA-mediated ceRNA networks in the development and pathophysiology of human viral cancers, including cervical cancer, gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Understanding these mechanisms can improve our knowledge of how oncoviruses contribute to human tumourigenesis and identify potential targets for developing optimised therapies and diagnostic tools for viral cancers."
38517045,Drug-target Mendelian randomization revealed a significant association of genetically proxied metformin effects with increased prostate cancer risk.,"The association between metformin use and risk of prostate cancer remains controversial, while data from randomized trials is lacking. We aim to evaluate the association of genetically proxied metformin effects with prostate cancer risk using a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Summary statistics for prostate cancer were obtained from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome Consortium (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls). Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) variants in the gene targets of metformin were identified in the GTEx project and eQTLGen consortium. We also obtained male-specific genome-wide association study data for type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI), total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin for mediation analysis. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression, weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO were performed in the main MR analysis. Multivariable MR was used to identify potential mediators and genetic colocalization analysis was performed to assess any shared genetic basis between two traits of interest. We found that genetically proxied metformin effects (1-SD HbA(1c) reduction, equivalent to 6.75 mmol/mol) were associated with higher risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio(IVW) [OR(IVW)]: 1.55, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.23-1.96, p = 3.0 x 10(-3)). Two metformin targets, mitochondrial complex I (OR(IVW): 1.48, 95% CI: 1.07-2.03, p = 0.016) and gamma-secretase complex (OR(IVW): 2.58, 95%CI :1.47-4.55, p = 0.001), showed robust associations with prostate cancer risk, and their effects were partly mediated through BMI (16.4%) and total testosterone levels (34.3%), respectively. These results were further supported by colocalization analysis that expressions of NDUFA13 and BMI, APH1A, and total testosterone may be influenced by shared genetic factors, respectively. In summary, our study indicated that genetically proxied metformin effects may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Repurposing metformin for prostate cancer prevention in general populations is not supported by our findings."

38515791,"Non-coding RNA transcripts, incredible modulators of cisplatin chemo-resistance in bladder cancer through operating a broad spectrum of cellular processes and signaling mechanism.","Bladder cancer (BC) is a highly frequent neoplasm in correlation with significant rate of morbidity, mortality, and cost. The onset of BC is predominantly triggered by environmental and/or occupational exposures to carcinogens, such as tobacco. There are two distinct pathways by which BC can be developed, including non-muscle-invasive papillary tumors (NMIBC) and non-papillary (or solid) muscle-invasive tumors (MIBC). The Cancer Genome Atlas project has further recognized key genetic drivers of MIBC along with its subtypes with particular properties and therapeutic responses; nonetheless, NMIBC is the predominant BC presentation among the suffering individuals. Radical cystoprostatectomy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have been verified to be the common therapeutic interventions in metastatic tumors, among which chemotherapeutics are more conventionally utilized. Although multiple chemo drugs have been broadly administered for BC treatment, cisplatin is reportedly the most effective chemo drug against the corresponding malignancy. Notwithstanding, tumor recurrence is usually occurred following the consumption of cisplatin regimens, particularly due to the progression of chemo-resistant trait. In this framework, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as abundant RNA transcripts arise from the human genome, are introduced to serve as crucial contributors to tumor expansion and cisplatin chemo-resistance in bladder neoplasm. In the current review, we first investigated the best-known ncRNAs, i.e. microRNAs (miRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), correlated with cisplatin chemo-resistance in BC cells and tissues. We noticed that these ncRNAs could mediate the BC-related cisplatin-resistant phenotype through diverse cellular processes and signaling mechanisms, reviewed here. Eventually, diagnostic and prognostic potential of ncRNAs, as well as their therapeutic capabilities were highlighted in regard to BC management."
38515566,Sulforaphane inhibits the growth of prostate cancer by regulating the microRNA-3919/DJ-1 axis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common solid cancer among men worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate compound, has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on a variety of cancers. However, the biological function of SFN in PCa has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was conducted to further investigate the possible underlying mechanism of SFN in PCa using in vitro cell culture and in vivo tumor model experiments. METHODS: Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing assay, transwell assay, or flow cytometry. Expression of microRNA (miR)-3919 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or in situ hybridization assay. Xenograft assay was conducted to validated the antitumor effect of miR-3919. The targeting relationship between miR-3919 and DJ-1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The level of DJ-1was measured by qRT-PCR or western blotting (WB). RESULTS: In the present study, SFN downregulated mRNA and protein expression of DJ-1, an oncogenic gene. Small RNA sequencing analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that microRNA (miR)-3919 directly targeted DJ-1 to inhibition its expression. Furthermore, miR-3919 overexpression impeded viability, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis of PCa cells. Tumor growth in nude mice was also inhibited by miR-3919 overexpression, and miR-3919 expression in PCa tissues was lower than that in peritumoral tissues in an in situ hybridization assay. Transfection with miR-3919 inhibitors partially reversed the effects of SFN on cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Overall, the miR-3919/DJ-1 axis may be involved in the effects of SFN on the malignant biological behavior of PCa cells, which might be a new therapeutic target in PCa."
38514847,Retinoblastoma-associated protein is important for TRIM24-mediated activation of the mTOR signaling pathway through DUSP2 action in prostate cancer.,"RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB) deletion is the most important genomic factor associated with the prognosis of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients receiving androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitor therapy. Loss of RB could support prostate cancer cell growth in a hormone-independent manner, but the underlying mechanism by which RB regulates tumor progression extends far beyond the cell cycle pathway. A previous study indicated that RB inactivates AKT signaling but has no effect on mTOR signaling in cancer cells. Here, we found that the S249/T252 site in RB is key to regulating the transcriptional activity of the tumor-promoting factor TRIM24 in CRPC, as identified through FXXXV mapping. The RB/TRIM24 complex functions through DUSP2, which serves as an intermediate bridge, to activate the mTOR pathway and promote prostate cancer progression. Accordingly, we designed RB-linker-proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecules, which decreased TRIM24 protein levels and inactivated the mTOR signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting prostate cancer. Therefore, this study not only elucidates the novel function of RB but also provides a theoretical basis for the development of new drugs for treating prostate cancer."
38513779,A metabolomics approach reveals metabolic disturbance of human cholangiocarcinoma cells after parthenolide treatment.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tanacetum parthenium (L.) Schultz-Bip, commonly known as feverfew, has been traditionally used to treat fever, migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Parthenolide (PTL), the main bioactive ingredient isolated from the shoots of feverfew, is a sesquiterpene lactone with anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. Previous studies showed that PTL exerts anticancer activity in various cancers, including hepatoma, cholangiocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. However, the metabolic mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of PTL remains poorly understood. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the anticancer activity and underlying mechanism of PTL in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this investigation, the effects and mechanisms of PTL on human cholangiocarcinoma cells were investigated via a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics approach. First, cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry analysis, and western blotting. Then, LC/MS-based metabolic profiling along with orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) has been constructed to distinguish the metabolic changes between the negative control group and the PTL-treated group in TFK1 cells. Next, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to investigate the changes of metabolic enzymes associated with significantly alerted metabolites. Finally, the metabolic network related to key metabolic enzymes, metabolites, and metabolic pathways was established using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Database. RESULTS: PTL treatment could induce the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of TFK1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Forty-three potential biomarkers associated with the antitumor effect of PTL were identified, which primarily related to glutamine and glutamate metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, glutathione metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, phospholipid catabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. Pathway analysis of upstream and downstream metabolites, we found three key metabolic enzymes, including glutaminase (GLS), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which mainly involved in glutamine and glutamate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. The changes of metabolic enzymes associated with significantly alerted metabolites were consistent with the levels of metabolites, and the metabolic network related to key metabolic enzymes, metabolites, and metabolic pathways was established. PTL may exert its antitumor effect against cholangiocarcinoma by disturbing metabolic pathways. Furthermore, we selected two positive control agents that are considered as first-line chemotherapy standards in cholangiocarcinoma therapy to verify the reliability and accuracy of our metabolomic study on PTL. CONCLUSION: This research enhanced our comprehension of the metabolic profiling and mechanism of PTL treatment on cholangiocarcinoma cells, which provided some references for further research into the anti-cancer mechanisms of other drugs."
38511243,Thermal Proteome Profiling Strategy Identifies CNPY3 as a Cellular Target of Gambogic Acid for Inducing Prostate Cancer Pyroptosis.,"There is an urgent requirement to acquire a comprehensive comprehension of novel therapeutic targets for prostate cancer to facilitate the development of medications with innovative mechanisms. In this study, we identified gambogic acid (GBA) as a specific pyroptosis inducer in prostatic cancer cells. By using a thermal proteome profiling (TPP) strategy, we revealed that GBA induces pyroptosis by directly targeting the canopy FGF signaling regulator (CNPY3), which was previously considered ""undruggable"". Moreover, through the utilization of the APEX2-based proximity labeling method, we found that GBA recruited delactatease SIRT1, resulting in the elimination of lysine lactylation (Kla) on CNPY3. Of note, SIRT1-mediated delactylation influenced the cellular localization of CNPY3 to promote lysosome rupture for triggering pyroptosis. Taken together, our study identified CNPY3 as a distinctive cellular target for pyroptosis induction and its potential application in prostate cancer therapy."
38509948,"Combination of theoretical analysis and experiments: Exploring the role of PLA2G7 in human cancers, including renal cancer.","BACKGROUND: The pivotal role of phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) has been identified in specific human cancers, such as prostate cancer, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and melanoma. Given PLA2G7's significant involvement in established tumors, exploring its role in other cancers is highly relevant. METHODS: In this study, we acquired and analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the UCSC XENA website, and other online platforms including Gene Set Cancer Analysis, cBioPortal, Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, and TISIDB to investigate PLA2G7's role in human cancers, including renal cancer. Furthermore, in vitro experiments, including immunofluorescence, western blotting, and CCK-8 assays, were conducted to elucidate PLA2G7's role in renal cancer. Finally, the relationship between PLA2G7 and various drug sensitivity was explored. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that PLA2G7 is highly expressed and may serve as a valuable candidate biomarker in pan-cancer. PLA2G7 exhibits distinct alteration frequencies across human cancers and is correlated with tumor mutation burden, tumor microenvironment, DNA stemness score, RNA stemness score, tumorigenesis, tumor immunity, and microsatellite instability in pan-cancer. Immunofluorescence and western blotting revealed a relative high level of PLA2G7 protein in renal cancer cell lines (ACHN and 786-O), predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Treatment with a PLA2G7 gene inhibitor (darapladib) significantly decreased the viability of ACHN and 786-O cell lines. Additionally, we observed an association between PLA2G7 mRNA levels and various drug sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that PLA2G7 has the potential to serve as a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer, particularly in the context of renal cancer."
38508940,Prostatic adenocarcinoma: molecular underpinnings and treatment-related options.,"Prostate cancer is heterogeneous with varied pathologic features and presents with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations from indolent to advanced cancer. Interrogation of the molecular landscape of prostate cancer has unveiled the complex genomic alterations in these tumors, which significantly impacts tumor biology. The documented array of chromosomal alterations, gene fusions, and epigenetic changes not only play a crucial role in oncogenesis and disease progression, but also impacts response and resistance to various therapeutic modalities. Various gene expression assays have been developed and are currently recommended in aiding clinical decision making in these clinically and molecularly heterogeneous cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of the molecular underpinnings of prostate cancer, and briefly review the current status of molecular testing and therapeutic options in the management of these tumors."
38507924,Specific vaginal and gut microbiome and the anti-tumor effect of butyrate in cervical cancer women.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the vaginal and gut microbes changes during the carcinogenesis of cervical and the auxiliary diagnostic value. To investigate the effect of microbiome-specific metabolites butyric on cervical cancer cells. METHODS: We studied 416 vaginal 16S rRNA sequencing data and 116 gut sequencing data. Reads were processed using VSEARCH. We used Shannon index, Chao1 index, Simpson diversity index, beta diversity index, Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe), co-abundance network and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to explore microbiome differences between groups. We constructed random forest models based on genus and verified its discriminant effect. Finally, we used the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method to detect cell proliferation capacity and flow cytometry to detect apoptosis and induction of cell cycle progression. RESULTS: Compared to the non-cancerous population, patients with cervical cancer had unique microbial community characteristics in both vaginal and gut ecological niches. Our predictive model based on genus in two ecological regions achieved high accuracy in the diagnosis of cervical cancer (vaginal model AUC=91.58 %; gut model AUC=99.95 %). Butyric inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner and promoted apoptosis of cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were found in vaginal and gut microbes in patients with cervical cancer compared to the non-cancerous population. The prediction models constructed at the genus level in both ecological sites have good diagnostic value. Microorganisms may be involved in cervical cancer progression in a metabolite-dependent way, and targeting butyric may provide therapeutic options for cervical cancer."
38507581,Long-term prediction by DNA methylation of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Results of the ARTISTIC cohort.,"Methylation markers have shown potential for triaging high-risk HPV-positive (hrHPV+) women to identify those at increased risk of invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Our aim was to assess the performance of the S5 DNA methylation classifier for predicting incident high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and ICC among hrHPV+ women in the ARTISTIC screening trial cohort. The S5 classifier, comprising target regions of tumour suppressor gene EPB41L3 and L1 and L2 regions of HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, and HPV33, was assayed by pyrosequencing in archived hrHPV+ liquid-based samples from 343 women with high-grade disease (139 CIN2, 186 CIN3, and 18 ICC) compared to 800 hrHPV+ controls. S5 DNA methylation correlated directly with increasing severity of disease and inversely with lead time to diagnosis. S5 could discriminate between hrHPV+ women who developed CIN3 or ICC and hrHPV+ controls (p <.0001) using samples taken on average 5 years before diagnosis. This relationship was independent of cytology at baseline. The S5 test showed much higher sensitivity than HPV16/18 genotyping for identifying prevalent CIN3 (93% vs. 61%, p = .01) but lower specificity (50% vs. 66%, p <.0001). The S5 classifier identified most women at high risk of developing precancer and missed very few prevalent advanced lesions thus appearing to be an objective test for triage of hrHPV+ women. The combination of methylation of host and HPV genes enables S5 to combine the predictive power of methylation with HPV genotyping to identify hrHPV-positive women who are at highest risk of developing CIN3 and ICC in the future."
38506808,Adrenal-Permissive Germline HSD3B1 Allele and Prostate Cancer Outcomes.,"IMPORTANCE: The adrenal androgen-metabolizing 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 enzyme, encoded by the HSD3B1 gene, catalyzes the rate-limiting step necessary for synthesizing nontesticular testosterone and dihydrotestosterone production. The common adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) allele is responsible for encoding the 3beta-HSD1 protein with decreased susceptibility to degradation resulting in higher extragonadal androgen synthesis. Retrospective studies have suggested an association of the HSD3B1 adrenal-permissive homozygous genotype with androgen deprivation therapy resistance in prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in mortality outcomes by HSD3B1 genetic status among men with prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of patients with prostate cancer who were enrolled in the Million Veteran Program within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system between 2011 and 2023 collected genotyping and phenotyping information. EXPOSURE: HSD3B1 genotype status was categorized as AA (homozygous adrenal-restrictive), AC (heterozygous adrenal-restrictive), or CC (homozygous adrenal-permissive). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome of this study was prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), defined as the time from diagnosis to death from prostate cancer, censored at the date of last VHA follow-up. Secondary outcomes included incidence of metastases and PCSM in predefined subgroups. RESULTS: Of the 5287 participants (median [IQR] age, 69 [64-74] years), 402 (7.6%) had the CC genotype, 1970 (37.3%) had the AC genotype, and 2915 (55.1%) had the AA genotype. Overall, the primary cause of death for 91 patients (1.7%) was prostate cancer. Cumulative incidence of PCSM at 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis was higher among men with the CC genotype (4.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-6.2%) compared with the AC genotype (2.1%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.8%) and AA genotype (1.9%; 95% CI, 1.3%-2.4%) (P = .02). In the 619 patients who developed metastatic disease at any time, the cumulative incidence of PCSM at 5 years was higher among patients with the CC genotype (36.0%; 95% CI, 16.7%-50.8%) compared with the AC genotype (17.9%; 95% CI, 10.5%-24.7%) and AA genotype (18.5%; 95% CI, 12.0%-24.6%) (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of US veterans undergoing treatment for prostate cancer at the VHA, the HSD3B1 CC genotype was associated with inferior outcomes. The HSD3B1 biomarker may help identify patients who may benefit from therapeutic targeting of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 and the androgen-signaling axis."
38506376,Effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin and naproxen) on inflammation-associated proteomic profiles in mouse plasma and prostate during TMPRSS2-ERG (fusion)-driven prostate carcinogenesis.,"Recent preclinical studies have shown that the intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin and naproxen could be an effective intervention strategy against TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-driven prostate tumorigenesis. Herein, as a follow-up mechanistic study, employing TMPRSS2-ERG (fusion) positive tumors and plasma from TMPRSS2-ERG. Pten(flox/flox) mice, we profiled the stage specific proteomic changes (focused on inflammatory circulating and prostate tissue/tumor-specific cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors/growth signaling-associated molecules) that contribute to prostate cancer (PCa) growth and progression in the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-driven mouse model of tumorigenesis. In addition, the association of the protective effects of NSAIDs (aspirin 1400 ppm and naproxen 400 ppm) with the modulation of these specific molecular pathways was determined. A sandwich Elisa based membrane array-proteome profiler identifying 111 distinct signaling molecules was employed. Overall, the plasma and prostate tissue sample analyses identified 54 significant and differentially expressed cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors/growth signaling-associated molecules between PCa afflicted mice (TMPRSS2-ERG. Pten(flox/flox), age-matched noncancerous controls, NSAIDs-supplemented and no-drug controls). Bioinformatic analysis of the array outcomes indicated that the protective effect of NSAIDs was associated with reduced expression of (a) tumor promoting inflammatory molecules (M-CSF, IL-33, CCL22, CCL12, CX3CL1, CHI3L1, and CD93), (b) growth factors- growth signaling-associated molecules (Chemerin, FGF acidic, Flt-3 ligand, IGFBP-5, and PEDF), and (c) tumor microenvironment/stromal remodeling proteins MMP2 and MMP9. Overall, our findings corroborate the pathological findings that protective effects of NSAIDs in TMPSS2-ERG fusion-driven prostate tumorigenesis are associated with antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects and possible modulation of the immune cell enriched microenvironment."
38505804,Inference of differential gene regulatory networks using boosted differential trees.,"SUMMARY: Diseases can be caused by molecular perturbations that induce specific changes in regulatory interactions and their coordinated expression, also referred to as network rewiring. However, the detection of complex changes in regulatory connections remains a challenging task and would benefit from the development of novel nonparametric approaches. We develop a new ensemble method called BoostDiff (boosted differential regression trees) to infer a differential network discriminating between two conditions. BoostDiff builds an adaptively boosted (AdaBoost) ensemble of differential trees with respect to a target condition. To build the differential trees, we propose differential variance improvement as a novel splitting criterion. Variable importance measures derived from the resulting models are used to reflect changes in gene expression predictability and to build the output differential networks. BoostDiff outperforms existing differential network methods on simulated data evaluated in four different complexity settings. We then demonstrate the power of our approach when applied to real transcriptomics data in COVID-19, Crohn's disease, breast cancer, prostate adenocarcinoma, and stress response in Bacillus subtilis. BoostDiff identifies context-specific networks that are enriched with genes of known disease-relevant pathways and complements standard differential expression analyses. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BoostDiff is available at https://github.com/scibiome/boostdiff_inference."
38503134,Upregulation of shelterin and CST genes and longer telomeres are associated with unfavorable prognostic characteristics in prostate cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Search for new clinical biomarkers targets in prostate cancer (PC) is urgent. Telomeres might be one of these targets. Telomeres are the extremities of linear chromosomes, essential for genome stability and control of cell divisions. Telomere homeostasis relies on the proper functioning of shelterin and CST complexes. Telomeric dysfunction and abnormal expression of its components are reported in most cancers and are associated with PC. Despite this, there are only a few studies about the expression of the main telomere complexes and their relationship with PC progression. We aimed to evaluate the role of shelterin (POT1, TRF2, TPP1, TIN2, and RAP1) and CST (CTC1, STN1, and TEN1) genes and telomere length in the progression of PC. METHODS: We evaluated genetic alterations of shelterin and CST by bioinformatics in samples of localized (n = 499) and metastatic castration-resistant PC (n = 444). We also analyzed the expression of the genes using TCGA (localized PC n = 497 and control n = 152) and experimental approaches, with surgical specimens (localized PC n = 81 and BPH n = 10) and metastatic cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, PC3 and PNT2 as control) by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR also determined the telomere length in the same experimental samples. All acquired data were associated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Genetic alterations are uncommon in PC, but POT1, TIN2, and TEN1 showed significantly more amplifications in the metastatic cancer. Except for CTC1 and TEN1, which are differentially expressed in localized PC samples, we did not detect an expression pattern relative to control and cell lines. Nevertheless, except for TEN1, the upregulation of all genes is associated with a worse prognosis in localized PC. We also found that increased telomere length is associated with disease aggressiveness in localized PC. CONCLUSION: The upregulation of shelterin and CST genes creates an environment that favors telomere elongation, giving selective advantages for localized PC cells to progress to more aggressive stages of the disease."
38502664,Association between multiple sclerosis and cancer risk: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-related disease and the relationship between MS and cancer has raised attention. Previous studies of the relationship between MS and cancer have reached conflicting conclusions. In this study, the two-sample MR method is used to investigate whether MS has a causal correlation with cancers and offer scientific evidence for cancer prevention. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to MS were obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) and SNPs related to 15 types of cancers were obtained from the GWASs based on UK Biobank. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was mainly used to assess causal effects. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with Cochran's Q-test, MR Egger intercept, leave-one-out test, and MR Steiger method. IVW analysis showed that MS was only associated with a marginal increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 1.0004, 95% CI 1.0002-1.0007, p = 0.0003). Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of MR analysis were robust and found no heterogeneity, no pleiotropy, and no reverse causation. In conclusion, this study finds no causal relationship between MS and 15 types of cancers except cervical cancer."
38502492,DBD-FISH Using Specific Chromosomal Region Probes for the Study of Cervical Carcinoma Progression.,"Genomic instability is an important biomarker in the progression of cervical carcinoma. DBD-FISH (DNA breakage detection-fluorescence in situ hybridization) is a sensitive method that detects strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and incomplete DNA excision repair in cells of the cervical epithelium. This technique integrates the microgel immersion of cells from a vaginal lesion scraping and the DNA unwinding treatment with the capacity of FISH integrated into digital image analysis. Cells captured within an agarose matrix are lysed and submerged in an alkaline unwinding solution that generates single-stranded DNA motifs at the ends of internal DNA strand breaks. After neutralization, the microgel is dehydrated and the cells are incubated with DNA-labeled probes. The quantity of a hybridized probe at a target sequence corresponds to the measure of the single-stranded DNA produced during the unwinding step, which is equivalent to the degree of local DNA breakage. DNA damage does not show uniformly throughout the entire DNA of a cell; rather, it is confined to specific chromosomal sites. In this chapter, an overview of the technique is supplied, focusing on its ability for assessing the association between DNA damage in specific sequences and in the progressive stages of cervical carcinoma."
38502405,GFP Transfection Alters Protein Expression Patterns in Prostate Cancer Cells: A Proteomic Study.,"PURPOSE: Green Fluorescent Protein is widely used as a cellular marker tool, but its potential influence on cells has been questioned. Although the potential off-target effects of GFP on tumor cells have been studied to some extent, the findings at the molecular level are insufficient to explain the effect of GFP expression on the tumorigenic capacity of cancer cells. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of GFP expression on the tumorigenicity of PC3 prostate cancer cells. METHODS: Using GFP-expressing and wild-type PC-3 cells, xenograft models were generated in athymic BALB/C mice. To identify differentially expressed proteins, the change in cells proteome was investigated by label-free quantification with nano-high performance liquid chromatography to tandem mass spectrometry (nHPLC-MS/MS). Proteins that showed significantly altered expression levels were evaluated using the bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Unlike the wild-type PC-3 cells, GFP-expressing cells failed to develop tumor. Comparative proteome analysis of GFP-expressing cells with WT PC-3 cells revealed a total of 216 differentially regulated proteins, of which 98 were upregulated and 117 were downregulated. CONCLUSION: Upon GFP expression, differential changes in several pathways including the immune system, translational machinery, energy metabolism, elements of cytoskeletal and VEGF signaling pathway were observed. Therefore, care should be taken into account to prevent reporting deceitful mechanisms generated from studies utilizing GFP."
38501452,Acetylated KHSRP impairs DNA-damage-response-related mRNA decay and facilitates prostate cancer tumorigenesis.,"Androgen-regulated DNA damage response (DDR) is one of the essential mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa), a hormone-sensitive disease. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK)-homology splicing regulatory protein known as far upstream element-binding protein 2 (KHSRP) is an RNA-binding protein that can attach to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to mediate mRNA decay and emerges as a critical regulator in the DDR to preserve genome integrity. Nevertheless, how KHSRP responds to androgen-regulated DDR in PCa development remains unclear. This study found that androgen can significantly induce acetylation of KHSRP, which intrinsically drives tumor growth in xenografted mice. Moreover, enhanced KHSRP acetylation upon androgen stimuli impedes KHSRP-regulated DDR gene expression, as seen by analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) datasets. Additionally, NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-7 (SIRT7) is a promising deacetylase of KHSRP, and androgen stimuli impairs its interaction with KHSRP to sustain the increased KHSRP acetylation level in PCa. We first report the acetylation of KHSRP induced by androgen, which interrupts the KHSRP-regulated mRNA decay of the DDR-related genes to promote the tumorigenesis of PCa. This study provides insight into KHSRP biology and potential therapeutic strategies for PCa treatment, particularly that of castration-resistant PCa."
38501160,State-of-the-art in transposable element modulation affected by drugs in malignant prostatic cancer cells.,"Over recent years, the investigation of transposable elements (TEs) has granted researchers a deeper comprehension of their characteristics and functions, particularly regarding their significance in the mechanisms contributing to cancer development. This manuscript focuses on prostate carcinoma cell lines and offers a comprehensive review intended to scrutinize the associations and interactions between TEs and genes, as well as their response to treatment using various chemical drugs, emphasizing their involvement in cancer progression. We assembled a compendium of articles retrieved from the PubMed database to construct networks demonstrating correlations with genes and pharmaceuticals. In doing so, we linked the transposition of certain TE types to the expression of specific transcripts directly implicated in carcinogenesis. Additionally, we underline that treatment employing different drugs revealed unique patterns of TE reactivation. Our hypothesis gathers the current understanding and guides research toward evidence-based investigations, emphasizing the association between antiviral drugs, chemotherapy, and the reduced expression of TEs in patients affected by prostate cancer."
38499326,Aberrant DNA methylation distorts developmental trajectories in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are pediatric brain tumors known for their aggressiveness and aberrant but still unresolved epigenetic regulation. To better understand their malignancy, we investigated how AT/RT-specific DNA hypermethylation was associated with gene expression and altered transcription factor binding and how it is linked to upstream regulation. Medulloblastomas, choroid plexus tumors, pluripotent stem cells, and fetal brain were used as references. A part of the genomic regions, which were hypermethylated in AT/RTs similarly as in pluripotent stem cells and demethylated in the fetal brain, were targeted by neural transcriptional regulators. AT/RT-unique DNA hypermethylation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 and linked to suppressed genes with a role in neural development and tumorigenesis. Activity of the several NEUROG/NEUROD pioneer factors, which are unable to bind to methylated DNA, was compromised via the suppressed expression or DNA hypermethylation of their target sites, which was also experimentally validated for NEUROD1 in medulloblastomas and AT/RT samples. These results highlight and characterize the role of DNA hypermethylation in AT/RT malignancy and halted neural cell differentiation."
38497108,Hormone replacement therapy in gynecological cancer survivors and BRCA mutation carriers: a MITO group survey.,"OBJECTIVE: Early iatrogenic menopause in gynecological cancer survivors and BRCA mutation (BRCAm) carriers undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a major health concern. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective remedy, but remains underused in clinical practice. The Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) group promoted a national survey to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding the prescription of HRT. METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered, multiple-choice 45-item questionnaire, available online to all MITO members for 2 months starting from January 2022. RESULTS: A total of 61 participants completed the questionnaire (47 out of 180 MITO centers; compliance: 26.1%). Most respondents were female (73.8%), younger than 50 years (65.6%), and gynecologic oncologists (55.7%), working in public general hospitals (49.2%). An 84.4% of specialists actively discuss HRT with patients and 51.0% of patients ask the specialist for an opinion on HRT. The rate of specialists globally in favor of prescribing HRT was 22.9% for ovarian cancer, 49.1% for cervical cancer, and 8.2% for endometrial cancer patients. Most respondents (70.5%) believe HRT is safe for BRCA-mutated patients after RRSO. Nearly 70% of physicians prescribe systemic HRT, while 23.8% prefer local HRT. Most specialists recommend HRT for as long as there is a benefit and generally for up to 5 years. CONCLUSION: Real-world data suggest that many healthcare professionals still do not easily prescribe HRT for gynecological cancer survivors and BRCA mutation carriers after RRSO. Further efforts are required to implement the use of HRT in clinical practice and to support both clinicians in recommending HRT and patients in accepting it."
38496750,Prostate-derived circulating microRNAs add prognostic value to prostate cancer risk calculators.,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of malignancy-related deaths among American men. Active surveillance is a safe option for many men with less aggressive disease, yet definitively determining low-risk cancer is challenging with biopsy alone. Herein, we sought to identify prostate-derived microRNAs in patient sera and serum extracellular vesicles, and determine if those microRNAs improve upon the current clinical risk calculators for prostate cancer prognosis before and after biopsy. Prostate-derived intracellular and extracellular vesicle-contained microRNAs were identified by small RNA sequencing of prostate cancer patient explants and primary cells. Abundant microRNAs were included in a custom microRNA PCR panel that was queried in whole serum and serum extracellular vesicles from a diverse cohort of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The levels of these circulating microRNAs significantly differed between indolent and aggressive disease and improved the area under the curve for pretreatment nomograms of prostate cancer disease risk. The microRNAs within the extracellular vesicles were the most informative and improved the AUC to 0.739 compared to the existing nomogram alone, which has an AUC of 0.561. The microRNAs in the whole serum improved it to AUC 0.675. In summary, quantifying microRNAs circulating in extracellular vesicles is a clinically feasible assay that may provide additional information for assessing prostate cancer risk stratification."
38494380,Systemic and Tumor-directed Therapy for Oligorecurrent Metastatic Prostate Cancer (SATURN): Primary Endpoint Results from a Phase 2 Clinical Trial.,"Nearly all men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) experience recurrence within 6 mo of testosterone recovery. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate whether addition of dual androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to intermittent ADT improves recurrence rates for men with between one and five nonvisceral, extrapelvic metastases on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography after prior radical prostatectomy. Patients received 6 mo of androgen annihilation therapy (AAT; leuprolide, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, and apalutamide) and metastasis-directed SBRT. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <0.05 ng/ml 6 mo after testosterone recovery (>/=150 ng/dl), with the study powered to detect an improvement from 1% to 12%. We enrolled 28 men between March 2021 and June 2022. Median follow-up was 20 mo (interquartile range 16-22). Twenty-six patients (93%) completed SBRT with 6 mo of hormone therapy, of whom six discontinued at least one ARPI; two patients withdrew prematurely. At 6 mo after testosterone recovery, PSA was maintained at <0.05 ng/ml in 13/26 patients (50%, 95% confidence interval 32-67%). Rates of grade 2 and 3 AAT toxicity were 21% and 21%. The results confirm that addition of metastasis-directed SBRT to highly potent systemic therapy can maintain low PSA after testosterone recovery, although further studies are needed to clarify the optimal systemic therapy regimen. PATIENT SUMMARY: We tested a combination of intensified hormone therapy (called androgen annihilation therapy) and radiotherapy targeted at metastases in men with recurrence of metastatic prostate cancer. We found that half of patients were recurrence-free 6 months after their testosterone level recovered, and that less than a quarter of patients experienced a severe drug-related side effect. Overall, this appears to be an effective therapy with acceptable side effects. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03902951."
38492111,Treatment intensification strategies for men undergoing definitive radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: Treatment intensification of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) plays a crucial role in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: We performed a critical narrative review of the relevant literature and present new developments in evidence-based treatment intensification strategies. RESULTS: For men with high-risk prostate cancer, there is strong evidence to support prolonging androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to 18-36 months and escalating the dose to the prostate using a brachytherapy boost. A potentially less toxic alternative to a brachytherapy boost is delivering a focal boost to dominant intraprostatic lesions using EBRT. In patients who meet STAMPEDE high-risk criteria, there is evidence to support adding a second-generation anti-androgen agent, such as abiraterone acetate, to long-term ADT. Elective pelvic lymph node irradiation may be beneficial in select patients, though more prospective data is needed to elucidate the group of patients who may benefit the most. Tumor genomic classifier (GC) testing and advanced molecular imaging will likely play a role in improving patient selection for treatment intensification as well as contribute to the evolution of treatment intensification strategies for future patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment intensification using a combination of EBRT, advanced hormonal therapies, and brachytherapy may improve patient outcomes and survival in men with high-risk prostate cancer. Shared decision-making between patients and multidisciplinary teams of radiation oncologists, urologists, and medical oncologists is essential for personalizing care in this setting and deciding which strategies make sense for individual patients."
38491294,"Association between thyroid disorders and extra-thyroidal cancers, a review.","Thyroid hormone has been shown to have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing actions, which has led to significant debate over its involvement in the development of cancer. Proliferation, apoptosis, invasiveness, and angiogenesis are all aspects of cancer that are affected by the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, according to research conducted in animal models and in vitro experiments. The effects of thyroid hormones on cancer cells are mediated by many non-genomic mechanisms, one of which involves the activation of the plasma membrane receptor integrin alphavbeta3. Typically, abnormal amounts of thyroid hormones are linked to a higher occurrence of cancer. Both benign and malignant thyroid disorders were found to be associated with an increased risk of extra-thyroidal malignancies, specifically colon, breast, prostate, melanoma, and lung cancers. The purpose of this review was to shed light on this link to define which types of cancer are sensitive to thyroid hormones and, as a result, are anticipated to respond favorably to treatment of the thyroid hormone axis."
38490207,The association of cigarette smoking with DNA methylation and gene expression in human tissue samples.,"Cigarette smoking adversely affects many aspects of human health, and epigenetic responses to smoking may reflect mechanisms that mediate or defend against these effects. Prior studies of smoking and DNA methylation (DNAm), typically measured in leukocytes, have identified numerous smoking-associated regions (e.g., AHRR). To identify smoking-associated DNAm features in typically inaccessible tissues, we generated array-based DNAm data for 916 tissue samples from the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project representing 9 tissue types (lung, colon, ovary, prostate, blood, breast, testis, kidney, and muscle). We identified 6,350 smoking-associated CpGs in lung tissue (n = 212) and 2,735 in colon tissue (n = 210), most not reported previously. For all 7 other tissue types (sample sizes 38-153), no clear associations were observed (false discovery rate 0.05), but some tissues showed enrichment for smoking-associated CpGs reported previously. For 1,646 loci (in lung) and 22 (in colon), smoking was associated with both DNAm and local gene expression. For loci detected in both lung and colon (e.g., AHRR, CYP1B1, CYP1A1), top CpGs often differed between tissues, but similar clusters of hyper- or hypomethylated CpGs were observed, with hypomethylation at regulatory elements corresponding to increased expression. For lung tissue, 17 hallmark gene sets were enriched for smoking-associated CpGs, including xenobiotic- and cancer-related gene sets. At least four smoking-associated regions in lung were impacted by lung methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that co-localize with genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals for lung function (FEV1/FVC), suggesting epigenetic alterations can mediate the effects of smoking on lung health. Our multi-tissue approach has identified smoking-associated regions in disease-relevant tissues, including effects that are shared across tissue types."
38489690,Mendelian randomization analysis reveals a protective association between genetically predicted systemic lupus erythematosus and renal cell carcinoma.,"Observational studies have suggested that there may be a connection between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a higher likelihood of developing urological cancers, although the exact cause-effect relationship is still unclear. This study therefore investigated the causal relationship between SLE and urological cancers using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Our primary MR analysis involved using the inverse variance weighted method, which employed an inverse-variance-weighted approach, to examine the causal relationship between SLE and urological conditions. In addition, we performed various sensitivity analyses, such as MR-Egger regression, tests for heterogeneity, and leave-one-out sensitivity tests, to assess the reliability of our results. The findings from our analysis using Two-Sample MR showed that genetically predicted SLE was linked to a reduced likelihood of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (odds ratio = 0.9996, 95% confidence interval = 0.9993-0.9999, P value = .0159). These results suggest a possible protective impact of SLE against RCC. Nevertheless, no substantial correlation was detected between SLE and the likelihood of developing bladder cancer or prostate cancer. Collectively, these findings offer significant fresh perspectives on the possible correlation between SLE and genitourinary malignancies, specifically RCC, which will provide ideas and basis for the treatment of RCC."
38488813,Integrative Molecular Analyses of the MD Anderson Prostate Cancer Patient-derived Xenograft (MDA PCa PDX) Series.,"PURPOSE: Develop and deploy a robust discovery platform that encompasses heterogeneity, clinical annotation, and molecular characterization and overcomes the limited availability of prostate cancer models. This initiative builds on the rich MD Anderson (MDA) prostate cancer (PCa) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) resource to complement existing publicly available databases by addressing gaps in clinically annotated models reflecting the heterogeneity of potentially lethal and lethal prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed whole-genome, targeted, and RNA sequencing in representative samples of the same tumor from 44 PDXs derived from 38 patients linked to donor tumor metadata and corresponding organoids. The cohort includes models derived from different morphologic groups, disease states, and involved organ sites (including circulating tumor cells), as well as paired samples representing heterogeneity or stages before and after therapy. RESULTS: The cohort recapitulates clinically reported alterations in prostate cancer genes, providing a data resource for clinical and molecular interrogation of suitable experimental models. Paired samples displayed conserved molecular alteration profiles, suggesting the relevance of other regulatory mechanisms (e.g., epigenomic) influenced by the microenvironment and/or treatment. Transcriptomically, models were grouped on the basis of morphologic classification. DNA damage response-associated mechanisms emerged as differentially regulated between adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer in a cross-interrogation of PDX/patient datasets. CONCLUSIONS: We addressed the gap in clinically relevant prostate cancer models through comprehensive molecular characterization of MDA PCa PDXs, providing a discovery platform that integrates with patient data and benchmarked to therapeutically relevant consensus clinical groupings. This unique resource supports robust hypothesis generation and testing from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives."
38487860,Association between 19 medication use and risk of common cancers: A cross-sectional and Mendelian randomisation study.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have yielded inconsistent results concerning drug use and the risk of cancers. We conducted a large-scale cross-sectional study and a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to reveal the causal effect between the use of 19 medications and the risk of four common cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate). METHODS: We obtained information on medication use and cancer diagnosis from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants. After propensity score matching, we conducted survey-weighted multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analysis to assess the observed correlation between medication use and cancer while adjusting for multiple covariates. We also performed MR analysis to investigate causality based on summary data from genome-wide association studies on medication use and cancers. We performed sensitivity analyses, replication analysis, genetic correlation analysis, and reverse MR analysis to improve the reliability of MR findings. RESULTS: We found that the use of agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.27-0.63, P < 0.001), and there was a nonlinear association of 'decrease-to-increase-to-decrease' (P < 0.0001). The random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) model-based primary MR analysis (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.91-0.97, P = 0.0007) and replication MR analysis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.85-0.96, P = 0.0006) both provided robust evidence of the causality of genetic liability for the use of agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system on a decreased risk of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides robust evidence that the use of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system can reduce prostate cancer risk. Given the high prevalence of prostate cancer, these findings have important implications for drug selection and prostate cancer prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease."
38486933,"Integrating primary care, shared decision making, and community engagement to facilitate equitable access to multi-cancer early detection clinical trials.","Effective implementation of cancer screening programs can reduce disease-specific incidence and mortality. Screening is currently recommended for breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer. However, initial and repeat adherence to screening tests in accordance with current guidelines is sub-optimal, with the lowest rates observed in historically underserved groups. If used in concert with recommended cancer screening tests, new biospecimen-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests could help to identify more cancers that may be amendable to effective treatment. Clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of MCED tests to assess their potential for reducing cancer mortality are needed and many are underway. In the conduct of MCED test trials, it is crucial that participant recruitment efforts successfully engage participants from diverse populations experiencing cancer disparities. Strategic partnerships involving health systems, clinical practices, and communities can increase the reach of MCED trial recruitment efforts among populations experiencing disparities. This goal can be achieved by developing health system-based learning communities that build understanding of and trust in biomedical research; and by applying innovative methods for identifying eligible trial patients, educating potential participants about research trials, and engaging eligible individuals in shared decision making (SDM) about trial participation. This article describes how a developing consortium of health systems has used this approach to encourage the uptake of cancer screening in a wide range of populations and how such a strategy can facilitate the enrollment of persons from diverse patient and community populations in MCED trials."
38485766,Lamin B1 curtails early human papillomavirus infection by safeguarding nuclear compartmentalization and autophagic capacity.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a primary cause of cervical and head-and-neck cancers. The HPV genome enters the nucleus during mitosis when the nuclear envelope disassembles. Given that lamins maintain nuclear integrity during interphase, we asked to what extent their loss would affect early HPV infection. To address this question, we infected human cervical cancer cells and keratinocytes lacking the major lamins with a HPV16 pseudovirus (HP-PsV) encoding an EGFP reporter. We found that a sustained reduction or complete loss of lamin B1 significantly increased HP-PsV infection rate. A corresponding greater nuclear HP-PsV load in LMNB1 knockout cells was directly related to their prolonged mitotic window and extensive nuclear rupture propensity. Despite the increased HP-PsV presence, EGFP transcript levels remained virtually unchanged, indicating an additional defect in protein turnover. Further investigation revealed that LMNB1 knockout led to a substantial decrease in autophagic capacity, possibly linked to the persistent activation of cGAS by cytoplasmic chromatin exposure. Thus, the attrition of lamin B1 increases nuclear perviousness and attenuates autophagic capacity, creating an environment conducive to unrestrained accumulation of HPV capsids. Our identification of lower lamin B1 levels and nuclear BAF foci in the basal epithelial layer of several human cervix samples suggests that this pathway may contribute to an increased individual susceptibility to HPV infection."
38485644,"Ductal, intraductal, and cribriform carcinoma of the prostate: Molecular characteristics and clinical management.","Prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma accounts for approximately 95% of prostate cancer (CaP) cases. The remaining 5% of histologic subtypes of CaP are known to be more aggressive and have recently garnered substantial attention. These histologic subtypes - namely, prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), and cribriform carcinoma of the prostate (CC-P) - typically exhibit distinct growth characteristics, genomic features, and unique oncologic outcomes. For example, PTEN mutations, which cause uncontrolled cell growth, are frequently present in IDC-P and CC-P. Germline mutations in homologous DNA recombination repair (HRR) genes (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2) are discovered in 40% of patients with IDC-P, while only 9% of patients without ductal involvement had a germline mutation. CC-P is associated with deletions in common tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN, TP53, NKX3-1, MAP3K7, RB1, and CHD1. Evidence suggests abiraterone may be superior to docetaxel as a first-line treatment for patients with IDC-P. To address these and other critical pathological attributes, this review examines the molecular pathology, genetics, treatments, and oncologic outcomes associated with CC-P, PDA, and IDC-P with the objective of creating a comprehensive resource with a centralized repository of information on PDA, IDC-P, and CC-P."
38485184,Phase II study of nivolumab in patients with genetic alterations in DNA damage repair and response who progressed after standard treatment for metastatic solid cancers (KM-06).,"BACKGROUND: Immune-modulating antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) have demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in various types of cancers, especially highly mutated ones. Genetic alterations in DNA damage response and repair (DDR) genes can lead to genetic instability, often accompanied by a high tumor mutation burden (TMB). However, few studies have validated the aberration of DDR genes as a predictive biomarker for response to immune-modulating antibodies. METHODS: The KM-06 open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in refractory solid cancers with DDR gene mutations assessed by clinically targeted sequencing. Nivolumab (3 mg/kg) was administered every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for 24 months. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) as per RECIST V.1.1 criteria. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the study (median age 61, 58.3% male). The most common cancer type was colorectal cancer (41.7%), followed by prostate and biliary tract cancer (8.3% each). Eight patients achieved a partial response as their best overall response, resulting in an ORR of 17.8%. The disease control rate was 60.0%. The median progression-free survival was 2.9 months. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade and grade >/=3 occurred in 44 (91.7%) and 4 (8.3%) patients, respectively. Clinically targeted sequencing data inferred both TMB and microsatellite instability (MSI). Using a TMB cut-off of 12 mut/Mb, there were significant differences in overall survival (p=0.00035), progression-free survival (p=0.0061), and the best overall response (p=0.05). In the RNA sequencing analysis, nivolumab responders showed activation of the interleukin signaling pathway. Patients who experienced early progression presented high epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathway activation. The responders exhibited a marked increase in PD-1-/Ki67+CD8 T cells at the early stage of treatment (C3D1) compared with non-responders (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this phase II trial, nivolumab demonstrated moderate efficacy and manageable toxicity in patients with solid cancer harboring DDR gene mutations. A high TMB (>12 mut/Mb) and MSI score (>2.5) determined through clinically target sequencing presented significant discriminatory power for the nivolumab response. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04761744."
38483933,Integration Analysis of Single-Cell Multi-Omics Reveals Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is an extensive heterogeneous disease with a complex cellular ecosystem in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the manner in which heterogeneity is shaped by tumors and stromal cells, or vice versa, remains poorly understood. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk ATAC-sequence are integrated from a series of patients with PCa and healthy controls. A stemness subset of club cells marked with SOX9(high)AR(low) expression is identified, which is markedly enriched after neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Furthermore, a subset of CD8(+)CXCR6(+) T cells that function as effector T cells is markedly reduced in patients with malignant PCa. For spatial transcriptome analysis, machine learning and computational intelligence are comprehensively utilized to identify the cellular diversity of prostate cancer cells and cell-cell communication in situ. Macrophage and neutrophil state transitions along the trajectory of cancer progression are also examined. Finally, the immunosuppressive microenvironment in advanced PCa is found to be associated with the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially induced by an FAP(+) fibroblast subset. In summary, the cellular heterogeneity is delineated in the stage-specific PCa microenvironment at single-cell resolution, uncovering their reciprocal crosstalk with disease progression, which can be helpful in promoting PCa diagnosis and therapy."
38483412,Noninferiority of Hypofractionated vs Conventional Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy for Genitourinary and Gastrointestinal Symptoms: The NRG-GU003 Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: No prior trial has compared hypofractionated postprostatectomy radiotherapy (HYPORT) to conventionally fractionated postprostatectomy (COPORT) in patients primarily treated with prostatectomy. OBJECTIVE: To determine if HYPORT is noninferior to COPORT for patient-reported genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms at 2 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, patients with a detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA; >/=0.1 ng/mL) postprostatectomy with pT2/3pNX/0 disease or an undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL) with either pT3 disease or pT2 disease with a positive surgical margin were recruited from 93 academic, community-based, and tertiary medical sites in the US and Canada. Between June 2017 and July 2018, a total of 296 patients were randomized. Data were analyzed in December 2020, with additional analyses occurring after as needed. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to receive 62.5 Gy in 25 fractions (HYPORT) or 66.6 Gy in 37 fractions (COPORT). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The coprimary end points were the 2-year change in score from baseline for the bowel and urinary domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite Index questionnaire. Secondary objectives were to compare between arms freedom from biochemical failure, time to progression, local failure, regional failure, salvage therapy, distant metastasis, prostate cancer-specific survival, overall survival, and adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 296 patients randomized (median [range] age, 65 [44-81] years; 100% male), 144 received HYPORT and 152 received COPORT. At the end of RT, the mean GU change scores among those in the HYPORT and COPORT arms were neither clinically significant nor different in statistical significance and remained so at 6 and 12 months. The mean (SD) GI change scores for HYPORT and COPORT were both clinically significant and different in statistical significance at the end of RT (-15.52 [18.43] and -7.06 [12.78], respectively; P < .001). However, the clinically and statistically significant differences in HYPORT and COPORT mean GI change scores were resolved at 6 and 12 months. The 24-month differences in mean GU and GI change scores for HYPORT were noninferior to COPORT using noninferiority margins of -5 and -6, respectively, rejecting the null hypothesis of inferiority (mean [SD] GU score: HYPORT, -5.01 [15.10] and COPORT, -4.07 [14.67]; P = .005; mean [SD] GI score: HYPORT, -4.17 [10.97] and COPORT, -1.41 [8.32]; P = .02). With a median follow-up for censored patients of 2.1 years, there was no difference between HYPORT vs COPORT for biochemical failure, defined as a PSA of 0.4 ng/mL or higher and rising (2-year rate, 12% vs 8%; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, HYPORT was associated with greater patient-reported GI toxic effects compared with COPORT at the completion of RT, but both groups recovered to baseline levels within 6 months. At 2 years, HYPORT was noninferior to COPORT in terms of patient-reported GU or GI toxic effects. HYPORT is a new acceptable practice standard for patients receiving postprostatectomy radiotherapy.

38482990,Ligand-gated ion channels as potential biomarkers for ADT-mediated cognitive decline in prostate cancer patients.,"Men with prostate cancer are at increased risk of developing cognitive decline by the use of second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors. To date, reliable and sensitive biomarkers that could distinguish men at high risk of cognitive dysfunction under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have not been characterized. We used high-throughput transcriptional profiling utilizing human prostate cancer cell culture models mimicking ADT, biomarker selection using minimal common oncology data elements-cytoscape, and bioinformatic analyses employing Advaita(R) iPathwayGuide and DisGeNET for identification of disease-related gene associations. Validation analysis of genes was performed on brain neuronal and glial cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Our systematic analysis of androgen deprivation-associated genes involved multiple biological processes, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and metabolic and cancer signaling pathways. Genes associated with neuroreceptor ligand interaction, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A and B receptors and nuclear core proteins, were identified as top upstream regulators. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analysis highlighted the role of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) and their receptors in cognitive dysfunction. Gene-disease association assigned forgetfulness, intellectual disability, visuospatial deficit, bipolar disorder, and other neurocognitive impairment with upregulation of type-1 angiotensin II receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, GABA type B receptor subunit 2 (GABBR2), GABRA3, GABRA5, GABRB1, glycine receptor beta, glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) type subunit 1, glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2D, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D, interferon beta 1, and nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 as top differentially expressed genes. Validation studies of brain glial cells, neurons, and patients on ADT demonstrated the association of these genes with cognitive decline. Our findings highlight LGICs as potential biomarkers for ADT-mediated cognitive decline. Further validation of these biomarkers may lead to future practical clinical use."
38482211,LncRNA PCAT6 is a predictor of poor prognosis of colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) has been studied in many cancers, yet its relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly defined. Here, we conducted an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to better clarify the role of PCAT6 in this cancer type. METHODS: Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were utilized to assess relative levels of PCAT6 in CRC tumors and normal tissues, while logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare the relationships between PCAT6 levels and clinicopathological findings. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to gauge correlations between PCAT6 and patient survival outcomes, while the biological roles of this lncRNA were investigated via a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach. The expression level of PCAT6 in CRC cell lines was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: PCAT6 levels were significantly correlated with CRC patient lymph node metastasis (N) stage [odds ratio (OR) =1.8 for N1 & N2 vs. N0], lymphatic invasion [OR =1.9 for yes vs. no), distant metastasis (M stage) (OR =2.1 for M1 vs. M0), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (OR =1.9 for >5 vs. </=5), perineural invasion (OR =1.9 for yes vs. no), pathologic stage (OR =1.9 for stage III/IV vs. stage I/II), and neoplasm type (OR =2.1 for rectal adenocarcinoma vs. colon adenocarcinoma) (all P<0.05). CRC patients expressing higher PCAT6 levels exhibited poorer survival outcomes than those expressing low levels of this lncRNA (P=0.017), and in univariate analyses, higher PCAT6 levels were linked to worse overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) =1.540; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.079-2.199; P=0.017], with this relationship also being preserved in a multivariate analysis (HR =6.892; 95% CI: 1.713-27.727, P=0.007). GSEA revealed high PCAT6 expression to be linked to differential DNA methylation enrichment, with high PCAT6 levels being associated with changes in base excision repair, cellular senescence, G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, chromatin-modifying enzyme, and gene silencing by RNA activity. The high expression of lncRNA PCAT6 in CRC cell lines was demonstrated by PCR experiments. CONCLUSIONS: PCAT6 represents a promising prognostic biomarker of poor CRC patient survival outcomes, with DNA methylation and RNA-mediated gene silencing being potentially promising mechanistic pathways whereby this lncRNA may shape patient outcomes."
38482016,Decoding the tumor microenvironment and molecular mechanism: unraveling cervical cancer subpopulations and prognostic signatures through scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-seq analyses.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma (CC) represents a prevalent gynecological neoplasm, with a discernible rise in prevalence among younger cohorts observed in recent years. Nonetheless, the intrinsic cellular heterogeneity of CC remains inadequately investigated. METHODS: We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis to scrutinize the tumor epithelial cells derived from four specimens of cervical carcinoma (CC) patients. This method enabled the identification of pivotal subpopulations of tumor epithelial cells and elucidation of their contributions to CC progression. Subsequently, we assessed the influence of associated molecules in bulk RNA sequencing (Bulk RNA-seq) cohorts and performed cellular experiments for validation purposes. RESULTS: Through our analysis, we have discerned C3 PLP2+ Tumor Epithelial Progenitor Cells as a noteworthy subpopulation in cervical carcinoma (CC), exerting a pivotal influence on the differentiation and progression of CC. We have established an independent prognostic indicator-the PLP2+ Tumor EPCs score. By stratifying patients into high and low score groups based on the median score, we have observed that the high-score group exhibits diminished survival rates compared to the low-score group. The correlations observed between these groups and immune infiltration, enriched pathways, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), drug sensitivity, among other factors, further underscore their impact on CC prognosis. Cellular experiments have validated the significant impact of ATF6 on the proliferation and migration of CC cell lines. CONCLUSION: This study enriches our comprehension of the determinants shaping the progression of CC, elevates cognizance of the tumor microenvironment in CC, and offers valuable insights for prospective CC therapies. These discoveries contribute to the refinement of CC diagnostics and the formulation of optimal therapeutic approaches."
38481282,TP63-TRIM29 axis regulates enhancer methylation and chromosomal instability in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. High variability in DNA methylation and a high rate of large genomic rearrangements are often observed in PRAD. RESULTS: To investigate the reasons for such high variance, we integrated DNA methylation, RNA-seq, and copy number alterations datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focusing on PRAD, and employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Our results show that only single cluster of co-expressed genes is associated with genomic and epigenomic instability. Within this cluster, TP63 and TRIM29 are key transcription regulators and are downregulated in PRAD. We discovered that TP63 regulates the level of enhancer methylation in prostate basal epithelial cells. TRIM29 forms a complex with TP63 and together regulates the expression of genes specific to the prostate basal epithelium. In addition, TRIM29 binds DNA repair proteins and prevents the formation of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion typically observed in PRAD. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that TRIM29 and TP63 are important regulators in maintaining the identity of the basal epithelium under physiological conditions. Furthermore, we uncover the role of TRIM29 in PRAD development."
38478628,Genome-wide repeat landscapes in cancer and cell-free DNA.,"Genetic changes in repetitive sequences are a hallmark of cancer and other diseases, but characterizing these has been challenging using standard sequencing approaches. We developed a de novo kmer finding approach, called ARTEMIS (Analysis of RepeaT EleMents in dISease), to identify repeat elements from whole-genome sequencing. Using this method, we analyzed 1.2 billion kmers in 2837 tissue and plasma samples from 1975 patients, including those with lung, breast, colorectal, ovarian, liver, gastric, head and neck, bladder, cervical, thyroid, or prostate cancer. We identified tumor-specific changes in these patients in 1280 repeat element types from the LINE, SINE, LTR, transposable element, and human satellite families. These included changes to known repeats and 820 elements that were not previously known to be altered in human cancer. Repeat elements were enriched in regions of driver genes, and their representation was altered by structural changes and epigenetic states. Machine learning analyses of genome-wide repeat landscapes and fragmentation profiles in cfDNA detected patients with early-stage lung or liver cancer in cross-validated and externally validated cohorts. In addition, these repeat landscapes could be used to noninvasively identify the tissue of origin of tumors. These analyses reveal widespread changes in repeat landscapes of human cancers and provide an approach for their detection and characterization that could benefit early detection and disease monitoring of patients with cancer."
38475762,A multicenter high-quality data registry for advanced proton therapy approaches: the POWER registry.,"BACKGROUND: Paucity and low evidence-level data on proton therapy (PT) represent one of the main issues for the establishment of solid indications in the PT setting. Aim of the present registry, the POWER registry, is to provide a tool for systematic, prospective, harmonized, and multidimensional high-quality data collection to promote knowledge in the field of PT with a particular focus on the use of hypofractionation. METHODS: All patients with any type of oncologic disease (benign and malignant disease) eligible for PT at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO), Milan, Italy, will be included in the present registry. Three levels of data collection will be implemented: Level (1) clinical research (patients outcome and toxicity, quality of life, and cost/effectiveness analysis); Level (2) radiological and radiobiological research (radiomic and dosiomic analysis, as well as biological modeling); Level (3) biological and translational research (biological biomarkers and genomic data analysis). Endpoints and outcome measures of hypofractionation schedules will be evaluated in terms of either Treatment Efficacy (tumor response rate, time to progression/percentages of survivors/median survival, clinical, biological, and radiological biomarkers changes, identified as surrogate endpoints of cancer survival/response to treatment) and Toxicity. The study protocol has been approved by the IEO Ethical Committee (IEO 1885). Other than patients treated at IEO, additional PT facilities (equipped with Proteus(R)ONE or Proteus(R)PLUS technologies by IBA, Ion Beam Applications, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) are planned to join the registry data collection. Moreover, the registry will be also fully integrated into international PT data collection networks."
38475692,Proteomics of prostate cancer serum and plasma using low and high throughput approaches.,"Despite progress, MS-based proteomics in biofluids, especially blood, faces challenges such as dynamic range and throughput limitations in biomarker and disease studies. In this work, we used cutting-edge proteomics technologies to construct label-based and label-free workflows, capable of quantifying approximately 2,000 proteins in biofluids. With 70microL of blood and a single depletion strategy, we conducted an analysis of a homogenous cohort (n = 32), comparing medium-grade prostate cancer patients (Gleason score: 7(3 + 4); TNM stage: T2cN0M0, stage IIB) to healthy donors. The results revealed dozens of differentially expressed proteins in both plasma and serum. We identified the upregulation of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a well-known biomarker for prostate cancer, in the serum of cancer cohort. Further bioinformatics analysis highlighted noteworthy proteins which appear to be differentially secreted into the bloodstream, making them good candidates for further exploration."
38474084,Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis Identified ASNS and DDIT3 as the Therapeutic Target in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Many studies have demonstrated the mechanisms of progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and novel strategies for its treatment. Despite these advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression to CRPC remain unclear, and currently, no effective treatments for CRPC are available. Here, we characterized the key genes involved in CRPC progression to gain insight into potential therapeutic targets. Bicalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells derived from LNCaP were generated and named Bical R. RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LNCaP and Bical R. In total, 631 DEGs (302 upregulated genes and 329 downregulated genes) were identified. The Cytohubba plug-in in Cytoscape was used to identify seven hub genes (ASNS, AGT, ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3, EFNA5, and VEGFA) associated with CRPC progression. Among these hub genes, ASNS and DDIT3 were markedly upregulated in CRPC cell lines and CRPC patient samples. The patients with high expression of ASNS and DDIT3 showed worse disease-free survival in patients with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) datasets. Our study revealed a potential association between ASNS and DDIT3 and the progression to CRPC. These results may contribute to the development of potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms underlying CRPC progression, aiming to improve clinical efficacy in CRPC treatment."
38473313,Spontaneous Fusion with Transformed Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Results in Complete Heterogeneity in Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Tumor cells gain advantages in growth and survival by acquiring genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Interactions with bystander cells in the tumor microenvironment contribute to the progression of heterogeneity. We have shown that fusion between tumor and bystander cells is one form of interaction, and that tumor-bystander cell fusion has contrasting effects. By trapping fusion hybrids in the heterokaryon or synkaryon state, tumor-bystander cell fusion prevents the progression of heterogeneity. However, if trapping fails, fusion hybrids will resume replication to form derivative clones with diverse genomic makeups and behavioral phenotypes. To determine the characteristics of bystander cells that influence the fate of fusion hybrids, we co-cultured prostate mesenchymal stromal cell lines and their spontaneously transformed sublines with LNCaP as well as HPE-15 prostate cancer cells. Subclones derived from cancer-stromal fusion hybrids were examined for genotypic and phenotypic diversifications. Both stromal cell lines were capable of fusing with cancer cells, but only fusion hybrids with the transformed stromal subline generated large numbers of derivative subclones. Each subclone had distinct cell morphologies and growth behaviors and was detected with complete genomic hybridization. The health conditions of the bystander cell compartment play a crucial role in the progression of tumor cell heterogeneity."
38473283,Predictive Value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Risk Stratification and Molecular Classification of Endometrial Cancer.,"This study evaluated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of endometrial cancer (EC) patients and identified differences based on risk group and molecular classification. The study involved a total of 175 EC patients. The MRI data were retrospectively reviewed and compared based on the risk of recurrence. Additionally, the associations between imaging phenotypes and genomic signatures were assessed. The low-risk and non-low-risk groups (intermediate, high-intermediate, high, metastatic) showed significant differences in tumor diameter (p < 0.001), signal intensity and heterogeneity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (p = 0.003), deep myometrial invasion (involvement of more than 50% of the myometrium), cervical invasion (p < 0.001), extrauterine extension (p = 0.002), and lymphadenopathy (p = 0.003). Greater diffusion restriction and more heterogeneity on DWI were exhibited in the non-low-risk group than in the low-risk group. Deep myometrial invasion, cervical invasion, extrauterine extension, lymphadenopathy, recurrence, and stage discrepancy were more common in the non-low-risk group (p < 0.001). A significant difference in microsatellite stability status was observed in the heterogeneity of the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (p = 0.027). However, no significant differences were found in MRI parameters related to TP53 mutation. MRI features can be valuable predictors for differentiating risk groups in patients with EC. However, further investigations are needed to explore the imaging markers based on molecular classification."
38472314,Epidemiologic and genetic associations of female reproductive disorders with depression or dysthymia: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies have previously reported an association between depression and certain female reproductive disorders. However, the causal relationships between depression and different types of female reproductive disorders remain unclear in terms of direction and magnitude. We conducted a comprehensive investigation using a two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, incorporating publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Our aim was to establish a causal relationship between genetically predicted depression and the risk of various female reproductive pathological conditions, such as ovarian dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), ovarian cysts, abnormal uterine and vaginal bleeding(AUB), endometriosis, leiomyoma of the uterus, female infertility, spontaneous abortion, eclampsia, pregnancy hypertension, gestational diabetes, excessive vomiting in pregnancy, cervical cancer, and uterine/endometrial cancer. We analyzed a substantial sample size, ranging from 111,831 to 210,870 individuals, and employed robust statistical methods, including inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO, to estimate causal effects. Sensitivity analyses, such as Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots, were also conducted to ensure the validity of our results. Furthermore, risk factor analyses were performed to investigate potential mediators associated with these observed relationships. Our results demonstrated that genetic predisposition to depression or dysthymia was associated with an increased risk of developing PCOS (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.59; P = 6.66 x 10(-11)), ovarian cysts (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.20-1.55; P = 1.57 x 10(-6)), AUB (OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.66; P = 3.01 x 10(-5)), and endometriosis (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.27-1.70; P = 2.21 x 10(-7)) after Bonferroni correction, but no evidence for reverse causality. Our study did not find any evidence supporting a causal or reverse causal relationship between depression/dysthymia and other types of female reproductive disorders. In summary, our study provides evidence for a causal relationship between genetically predicted depression and specific types of female reproductive disorders. Our findings emphasize the importance of depression management in the prevention and treatment of female reproductive disorders, notably including PCOS, ovarian cysts, AUB, and endometriosis."
38471646,Three-dimensional chromatin analysis reveals Sp1 as a mediator to program and reprogram HPV-host epigenetic architecture in cervical cancer.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is predominantly associated with HPV-related cancers, however, the precise mechanisms underlying the HPV-host epigenetic architectures in HPV carcinogenesis remain elusive. Here, we employed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) to comprehensively map HPV16/18-host chromatin interactions. Our study identified the transcription factor Sp1 as a pivotal mediator in programming HPV-host interactions. By targeting Sp1, the active histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3) and the HPV-host chromatin interactions are reprogrammed, which leads to the downregulation of oncogenes located near the integration sites in both HPV (E6/E7) and the host genome (KLF5/MYC). Additionally, Sp1 inhibition led to the upregulation of immune checkpoint genes by reprogramming histone modifications in host cells. Notably, humanized patient-derived xenograft (PDX-HuHSC-NSG) models demonstrated that Sp1 inhibition promoted anti-PD-1 immunotherapy via remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment in cervical cancer. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic analysis validated the enrichment of transcription factor Sp1 in epithelial cells of cervical cancer. In summary, our findings elucidate Sp1 as a key mediator involved in the programming and reprogramming of HPV-host epigenetic architecture. Inhibiting Sp1 with plicamycin may represent a promising therapeutic option for HPV-related carcinoma."
38467964,ceRNA Network and WGCNA Analyses of Differentially Expressed Genes in Cervical Cancer Tissues for Association with Survival of Patients.,"The study aims to search and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cervical cancer tissues as novel biomarkers to predict cervical cancer prognosis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on gene expression profiles in cervical cancer were downloaded and analyzed using R software to identify DEGs in cervical cancer tissues. miRNAs targeted by differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs targeted by microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified using the online miRcode, miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB tools. The ceRNA network and lncRNA expression modules in cervical cancer tissues were constructed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and analyzed bioinformatically. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to confirm these DEGs as prognostic markers. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was used to verify expression of the hub genes in 10 paired cervical cancer and normal tissues. A total of 1914 DEmRNAs, 210 DElncRNAs, and 67 DEmiRNAs were identified in cervical cancer samples. There were 39 lncRNAs, 19 miRNAs, and 87 mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network and 25 DElncRNAs, three DEmiRNAs, and four mRNAs involved in the ceRNA sub-network. CACNA1C-AS1 was associated with the yellow and blue modules in the ceRNA sub-network, and LIFR-AS1 was associated with the blue module. The DEmRNAs were involved in cancer-related pathways, and three hub genes (i.e., E2F1, CCNB1, and CCNE1) were highly expressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma tissues and associated with the prognosis of patients. The ceRNA network and WGCNA analyses are useful to identify novel DEGs that can serve as prognostic markers in cervical cancer. The DEGs will be validated in future studies."
38466465,Evaluation of human papillomavirus type 16 viral load and genome physical status in Iranian women with cervical disease.,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the viral load and physical status of the human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) genome in non-cancerous, precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine HPV-16 E2 and E6 viral load in 132 cervical specimens. E2/E6 viral load ratio was used to determine the physical status of HPV-16 genome. RESULTS: E2 gene viral load was a significant (P < 0.001) predicting biomarker in differentiating non-cancerous from precancerous and cancerous samples. E6 gene viral load was significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity of E2 and E6 in distinguishing SCC samples were 100% and 95% respectively. CONCLUSION: HPV-16 viral load measured through E2 and E6 genes is a reliable indicator of lesion type."
38466204,Value of next generation sequencing (NGS) testing in advanced cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The availability of targeted therapies for oncology patients is increasing. Available genomic tests to identify treatment-eligible patients include single gene tests and gene panel tests, including the whole-exome, whole-transcriptome OncoExTra test. We assessed the costs and clinical benefits of test choice. METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based model was developed to evaluate test choice in patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Treatment pathways were based on NCCN guidelines and medical expert opinion. Inputs were derived from published literature. Annual economic results and lifetime clinical results with OncoExTra testing were projected per-tested-patient and compared with single gene testing and no testing. Separately, results were estimated for a US health plan without the OncoExTra test and with its use in 5% of patients. RESULTS: Compared with no genomic testing, OncoExTra test use increased costs by $4,915 per patient; however, 82%-92% of individuals across tumour types were identified as eligible for targeted therapy or a clinical trial. Compared with single gene testing, OncoExTra test use decreased costs by $9,966 per-patient-tested while increasing use of approved or investigational targeted therapies by 20%. When considering a hypothetical health plan with 1 million members, 858 patients were eligible for genomic testing. Using the OncoExTra test in 5% of those eligible, per-member per-month costs decreased by $0.003, ranging from cost-savings of $0.026 in NSCLC patients to a $0.009 increase in prostate cancer patients. Cost-savings were driven by reduced treatment costs with increased clinical trial enrolment and reduced direct and indirect medical costs associated with targeted treatments. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the required simplifications in modelling complex conditions that may not fully reflect evolving real-world testing and treatment patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to single-gene testing, results indicate that using next generation sequencing test such as OncoExTra identified more actionable alterations, leading to improved outcomes and reduced costs."
38464251,NSD2 is a requisite subunit of the AR/FOXA1 neo-enhanceosome in promoting prostate tumorigenesis.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-responsive transcription factor that binds at enhancers to drive terminal differentiation of the prostatic luminal epithelia. By contrast, in tumors originating from these cells, AR chromatin occupancy is extensively reprogrammed to drive hyper-proliferative, metastatic, or therapy-resistant phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the tumor-specific enhancer circuitry of AR is critically reliant on the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2), a histone 3 lysine 36 di-methyltransferase. NSD2 expression is abnormally gained in prostate cancer cells and its functional inhibition impairs AR trans-activation potential through partial off-loading from over 40,000 genomic sites, which is greater than 65% of the AR tumor cistrome. The NSD2-dependent AR sites distinctly harbor a chimeric AR-half motif juxtaposed to a FOXA1 element. Similar chimeric motifs of AR are absent at the NSD2-independent AR enhancers and instead contain the canonical palindromic motifs. Meta-analyses of AR cistromes from patient tumors uncovered chimeric AR motifs to exclusively participate in tumor-specific enhancer circuitries, with a minimal role in the physiological activity of AR. Accordingly, NSD2 inactivation attenuated hallmark cancer phenotypes that were fully reinstated upon exogenous NSD2 re-expression. Inactivation of NSD2 also engendered increased dependency on its paralog NSD1, which independently maintained AR and MYC hyper-transcriptional programs in cancer cells. Concordantly, a dual NSD1/2 PROTAC degrader, called LLC0150, was preferentially cytotoxic in AR-dependent prostate cancer as well as NSD2-altered hematologic malignancies. Altogether, we identify NSD2 as a novel subunit of the AR neo-enhanceosome that wires prostate cancer gene expression programs, positioning NSD1/2 as viable paralog co-targets in advanced prostate cancer."
38464162,Canonical AREs are tumor suppressive regulatory elements in the prostate.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is the central determinant of prostate tissue identity and differentiation, controlling normal, growth-suppressive prostate-specific gene expression (1) . It is also a key driver of prostate tumorigenesis, becoming ""hijacked"" to drive oncogenic transcription (2-5) . However, the regulatory elements determining the execution of the growth suppressive AR transcriptional program, and whether this can be reactivated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells remains unclear. Canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs are the classic DNA binding element for AR (6) . Here, we used a genome-wide strategy to modulate regulatory elements containing AREs to define distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activation of these AREs is specifically associated with differentiation and growth suppressive transcription, and this can be reactivated to cause death in AR (+) PCa cells. In contrast, repression of AREs is well tolerated by PCa cells, but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Finally, gene expression signatures driven by ARE activity are associated with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in human PCa patients. This study demonstrates that canonical AREs are responsible for a normal, growth-suppressive, lineage-specific transcriptional program, that this can be reengaged in PCa cells for potential therapeutic benefit, and genes controlled by this mechanism are clinically relevant in human PCa patients."
38464122,Machine learning identifies cell-free DNA 5-hydroxymethylation biomarkers that detect occult colorectal cancer in PLCO Screening Trial subjects.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and CRC detection through screening improves survival rates. A promising avenue to improve patient screening compliance is the development of minimally-invasive liquid biopsy assays that target CRC biomarkers on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in peripheral plasma. In this report, we identify cfDNA biomarker candidate genes bearing the epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) that diagnose occult CRC up to 36 months prior to clinical diagnosis using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial samples. METHODS: Archived PLCO Trial plasma samples containing cfDNA were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) biorepositories. Study subjects included those who were diagnosed with CRC within 36 months of blood collection (i.e., case, n = 201) and those who were not diagnosed with any cancer during an average of 16.3 years of follow-up (i.e., controls, n = 402). Following the extraction of 3 - 8 ng cfDNA from less than 300 microliters plasma, we employed the sensitive 5hmC-Seal chemical labeling approach, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then conducted association studies and machine-learning modeling to analyze the genome-wide 5hmC profiles within training and validation groups that were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. RESULTS: Despite the technical challenges associated with the PLCO samples (e.g., limited plasma volumes, low cfDNA amounts, and long archival times), robust genome-wide 5hmC profiles were successfully obtained from these samples. Association analyses using the Cox proportional hazards models suggested several epigenetic pathways relevant to CRC development distinguishing cases from controls. A weighted Cox model, comprised of 32-associated gene bodies, showed predictive detection value for CRC as early as 24-36 months prior to overt tumor presentation, and a trend for increased predictive power was observed for blood samples collected closer to CRC diagnosis. Notably, the 5hmC-based predictive model showed comparable performance regardless of sex and self-reported race/ethnicity, and significantly outperformed risk factors such as age and obesity according to BMI (body mass index). Additionally, further improvement of predictive performance was achieved by combining the 5hmC-based model and risk factors for CRC. CONCLUSIONS: An assay of 5hmC epigenetic signals on cfDNA revealed candidate biomarkers with the potential to predict CRC occurrence despite the absence of clinical symptoms or the availability of effective predictors. Developing a minimally-invasive clinical assay that detects 5hmC-modified biomarkers holds promise for improving early CRC detection and ultimately patient survival through higher compliance screening and earlier intervention. Future investigation to expand this strategy to prospectively collected samples is warranted."
38461243,"MAL expression downregulation through suppressive H3K27me3 marks at the promoter in HPV16-related cervical cancers is prognostically relevant and manifested by the interplay of novel MAL antisense long noncoding RNA AC103563.8, E7 oncoprotein and EZH2.","BACKGROUND: MAL (T-lymphocyte maturation-associated protein) is highly downregulated in most cancers, including cervical cancer (CaCx), attributable to promoter hypermethylation. Long noncoding RNA genes (lncGs) play pivotal roles in CaCx pathogenesis, by interacting with human papillomavirus (HPV)-encoded oncoproteins, and epigenetically regulating coding gene expression. Hence, we attempted to decipher the impact and underlying mechanisms of MAL downregulation in HPV16-related CaCx pathogenesis, by interrogating the interactive roles of MAL antisense lncRNA AC103563.8, E7 oncoprotein and PRC2 complex protein, EZH2. RESULTS: Employing strand-specific RNA-sequencing, we confirmed the downregulated expression of MAL in association with poor overall survival of CaCx patients bearing HPV16, along with its antisense long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AC103563.8. The strength of positive correlation between MAL and AC103563.8 was significantly high among patients compared to normal individuals. While downregulated expression of MAL was significantly associated with poor overall survival of CaCx patients bearing HPV16, AC103563.8 did not reveal any such association. We confirmed the enrichment of chromatin suppressive mark, H3K27me3 at MAL promoter, using ChIP-qPCR in HPV16-positive SiHa cells. Subsequent E7 knockdown in such cells significantly increased MAL expression, concomitant with decreased EZH2 expression and H3K27me3 marks at MAL promoter. In silico analysis revealed that both E7 and EZH2 bear the potential of interacting with AC103563.8, at the same binding domain. RNA immunoprecipitation with anti-EZH2 and anti-E7 antibodies, respectively, and subsequent quantitative PCR analysis in E7-silenced and unperturbed SiHa cells confirmed the interaction of AC103563.8 with EZH2 and E7, respectively. Apparently, AC103563.8 seems to preclude EZH2 and bind with E7, failing to block EZH2 function in patients. Thereby, enhanced EZH2 expression in the presence of E7 could potentially inactivate the MAL promoter through H3K27me3 marks, corroborating our previous results of MAL expression downregulation in patients. CONCLUSION: AC103563.8-E7-EZH2 axis, therefore, appears to crucially regulate the expression of MAL, through chromatin inactivation in HPV16-CaCx pathogenesis, warranting therapeutic strategy development."
38459936,Clonal origin and genomic diversity in Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer with multiple synchronous tumors: Identification of the pathogenicity of MLH1 p.L582H.,"Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer patients often present multiple synchronous tumors and this assessment can affect treatment strategies. We present a case of a 27-year-old woman with tumors in the uterine corpus, cervix, and ovaries who was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and exhibited cervical invasion and ovarian metastasis. Her family history suggested Lynch syndrome, and genetic testing identified a variant of uncertain significance, MLH1 p.L582H. We conducted immunohistochemical staining, microsatellite instability analysis, and Sanger sequencing for Lynch syndrome-associated cancers in three generations of the family and identified consistent MLH1 loss. Whole-exome sequencing for the corpus, cervical, and ovarian tumors of the proband identified a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) occurring at the MLH1 position in all tumors. This indicated that the germline variant and the copy-neutral LOH led to biallelic loss of MLH1 and was the cause of cancer initiation. All tumors shared a portion of somatic mutations with high mutant allele frequencies, suggesting a common clonal origin. There were no mutations shared only between the cervix and ovary samples. The profiles of mutant allele frequencies shared between the corpus and cervix or ovary indicated that two different subclones originating from the corpus independently metastasized to the cervix or ovary. Additionally, all tumors presented unique mutations in endometrial cancer-associated genes such as ARID1A and PIK3CA. In conclusion, we demonstrated clonal origin and genomic diversity in a Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer, suggesting the importance of evaluating multiple sites in Lynch syndrome patients with synchronous tumors."
38459454,A multiplex RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a-based POCT technique and its application in human papillomavirus (HPV) typing assay.,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the primary and initiating factor for cervical cancer. With over 200 identified HPV types, including 14 high-risk types that integrate into the host cervical epithelial cell DNA, early determination of HPV infection type is crucial for effective risk stratification and management. Presently, on-site immediate testing during the HPV screening stage, known as Point of Care Testing (POCT), remains immature, severely limiting the scope and scenarios of HPV screening. This study, guided by the genomic sequence patterns of HPV, established a multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technology based on the concept of ""universal primers."" This approach achieved the multiple amplification of RPA, coupled with the CRISPR/Cas12a system serving as a medium for signal amplification and conversion. The study successfully constructed a POCT combined detection system, denoted as H-MRC12a (HPV-Multiple RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a), and applied it to high-risk HPV typing detection. The system accomplished the typing detection of six high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, and 45) can be completed within 40 min, and the entire process, from sample loading to result interpretation, can be accomplished within 45 min, with a detection depth reaching 1 copy/muL for each high-risk type. Validation of the H-MRC12a detection system's reproducibility and specificity was further conducted through QPCR on 34 clinical samples. Additionally, this study explored and optimized the multiplex RPA amplification system and CRISPR system at the molecular mechanism level. Furthermore, the primer design strategy developed in this study offers the potential to enhance the throughput of H-MRC12a detection while ensuring sensitivity, providing a novel research avenue for high-throughput detection in Point-of-Care molecular pathogen studies."
38458890,Identification of Genes with Rare Loss of Function Variants Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer and Survival.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is a substantial cause of mortality among men globally. Rare germline mutations in BRCA2 have been validated robustly as increasing risk of aggressive forms with a poorer prognosis; however, evidence remains less definitive for other genes. OBJECTIVE: To detect genes associated with PrCa aggressiveness, through a pooled analysis of rare variant sequencing data from six previously reported studies in the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (UKGPCS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We accumulated a cohort of 6805 PrCa cases, in which a set of ten candidate genes had been sequenced in all samples. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We examined the association between rare putative loss of function (pLOF) variants in each gene and aggressive classification (defined as any of death from PrCa, metastatic disease, stage T4, or both stage T3 and Gleason score >/=8). Secondary analyses examined staging phenotypes individually. Cox proportional hazards modelling and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to further examine the relationship between mutation status and survival. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We observed associations between PrCa aggressiveness and pLOF mutations in ATM, BRCA2, MSH2, and NBN (odds ratio = 2.67-18.9). These four genes and MLH1 were additionally associated with one or more secondary analysis phenotype. Carriers of germline mutations in these genes experienced shorter PrCa-specific survival (hazard ratio = 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.79-2.59, p = 4 x 10(-16)) than noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support that rare pLOF variants in specific genes are likely to increase aggressive PrCa risk and may help define the panel of informative genes for screening and treatment considerations. PATIENT SUMMARY: By combining data from several previous studies, we have been able to enhance knowledge regarding genes in which inherited mutations would be expected to increase the risk of more aggressive PrCa. This may, in the future, aid in the identification of men at an elevated risk of dying from PrCa."
38455773,Precision Population Cancer Medicine in Cancer of the Uterine Cervix: A Potential Roadmap to Eradicate Cervical Cancer.,"With the success of the Human Genome Project, the era of genomic medicine (GM) was born. Later on, as GM made progress, there was a feeling of exhilaration that GM could help resolve many disease processes. It also led to the conviction that personalized medicine was possible, and a relatively synonymous word, precision medicine (PM), was coined. However, the influence of environmental factors and social determinants of diseases was only partially given their due importance in the definition of PM, although more recently, this has been recognized. With the rapid advances in GM, big data, data mining, wearable devices for health monitoring, telemedicine, etc., PM can be more easily extended to population-level health care in disease management, prevention, early screening, and so on.and the term precision population medicine (PPM) more aptly describes it. PPM's potential in cancer care was posited earlier,and the current authors planned a series of cancer disease-specific follow-up articles. These papers are mainly aimed at helping emerging students in health sciences (medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, public health, population health), healthcare management (health-focused business administration, nonprofit administration, public institutional administration, etc.), and policy-making (e.g., political science), although not exclusively. This first disease-specific report focuses on the cancer of the uterine cervix (CC). It describes how recent breakthroughs can be leveraged as force multipliers to improve outcomes in CC - by improving early detection, better screening for CC, potential GM-based interventions during the stage of persistent Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and treatment interventions - especially among the disadvantaged and resource-scarce populations. This work is a tiny step in our attempts to improve outcomes in CC and ultimately eradicate CC from the face of the earth."
38455413,Autophagy-related long non-coding RNAs act as prognostic biomarkers and associate with tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer.,"Aberrant autophagy could promote cancer cells to survive and proliferate in prostate cancer (PCa). LncRNAs play key roles in autophagy regulatory network. We established a prognostic model, which autophagy-related lncRNAs (au-lncRNAs) were used as biomarkers to predict prognosis of individuals with PCa. Depending on au-lncRNAs from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Human Autophagy Database, a risk score model was created. To evaluate the prediction accuracy, the calibration, Kaplan-Meier, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used. To clarify the biological function, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to determine the au-lncRNAs expression in PCa cell lines and healthy prostate cells for further confirmation. We identified five au-lncRNAs with prognostic significance (AC068580.6, AF131215.2, LINC00996, LINC01125 and LINC01547). The development of a risk scoring model required the utilization of multivariate Cox analysis. According to the model, we categorized PCa individuals into low- and high-risk cohorts. PCa subjects in the high-risk group had a worse disease-free survival rate than those in the low-risk group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods had corresponding areas under curves (AUC) of 0.788, 0.794, and 0.818. The prognosis of individuals with PCa could be predicted by the model with accuracy. Further analysis with GSEA showed that the prognostic model was associated with the tumor microenvironment, including immunotherapy, cancer-related inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming. Four lncRNAs expression in PCa cell lines was greater than that in healthy prostate cells. The au-lncRNA prognostic model has significant clinical implications in prognosis of PCa patient."
38454137,In vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies CITED2 as a driver of prostate cancer bone metastasis.,"Most cancer deaths are due to metastatic dissemination to distant organs. Bone is the most frequently affected organ in metastatic prostate cancer and a major cause of prostate cancer deaths. Yet, our partial understanding of the molecular factors that drive bone metastasis has been a limiting factor for developing preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve patient survival and well-being. Although recent studies have uncovered molecular alterations that occur in prostate cancer metastasis, their functional relevance for bone metastasis is not well understood. Using genome-wide CRISPR activation and inhibition screens we have identified multiple drivers and suppressors of prostate cancer metastasis. Through functional validation, including an innovative organ-on-a-chip invasion platform for studying bone tropism, our study identifies the transcriptional modulator CITED2 as a novel driver of prostate cancer bone metastasis and uncovers multiple new potential molecular targets for bone metastatic disease."
38453924,CRISPR/Cas9 model of prostate cancer identifies Kmt2c deficiency as a metastatic driver by Odam/Cabs1 gene cluster expression.,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) poses a significant therapeutic challenge with high mortality rates. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo, we target five potential tumor suppressor genes (Pten, Trp53, Rb1, Stk11, and RnaseL) in the mouse prostate, reaching humane endpoint after eight weeks without metastasis. By further depleting three epigenetic factors (Kmt2c, Kmt2d, and Zbtb16), lung metastases are present in all mice. While whole genome sequencing reveals few mutations in coding sequence, RNA sequencing shows significant dysregulation, especially in a conserved genomic region at chr5qE1 regulated by KMT2C. Depleting Odam and Cabs1 in this region prevents metastasis. Notably, the gene expression signatures, resulting from our study, predict progression-free and overall survival and distinguish primary and metastatic human prostate cancer. This study emphasizes positive genetic interactions between classical tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic modulators in metastatic PCa progression, offering insights into potential treatments."
38453655,Bioinformatics identification of characteristic genes of cervical cancer via an artificial neural network.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been extensively used in the field of medicine. The present hypothesis-free study sought to use an ANN to identify the characteristic genes of cervical cancer (CC). METHODS: RNA sequencing profiles were obtained from the GSE7410, GSE9750, GSE63514, and GSE52903 datasets. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and compared between the normal and CC tissues. An ANN analysis was conducted to obtain the random-forest tree and to examine differences in gene filtering. A neural network model was established using the characteristic genes of CC, while the verification accuracy of the model was examined by Cox regression. The differences in the immune infiltrating cells between the normal cervical and CC tissues were compared by CIBERSORT (an analytical tool can provide an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population). RESULTS: Nine genes' characteristics for CC were identified: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), chromosome 1 open reading frame 112 (C1orf112), helicase, lymphoid-specific (HELLS), mini-chromosome maintenance protein 5 (MCM5), mini-chromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2), kinetochore associated 1 (KNTC1), cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP3), phytanoyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase interacting protein (PHYHIP), and cornulin (CRNN). CONCLUSIONS: ANN is a robust neural network model that can be used to potentially predict CC based on the gene score. It can provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms of CC."
38453598,Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Screening in Carriers of Pathogenic Germline Mutations: Interim Results from the Initial Screening Round of the Prostate Cancer Genetic Risk Evaluation and Screening Study.,"BACKGROUND: The risk of early-onset and clinically aggressive prostate cancer is elevated in carriers of certain rare pathogenic germline mutations. The utility of augmenting traditional prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening measures with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in this population is not yet known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate MRI-based screening in comparison with traditional PSA-based screening among individuals at an elevated genetic risk for prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Male germline carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in any of 19 prostate cancer risk genes between the ages of 35 and 74 yr with no prior history of prostate cancer were recruited. Intervention Enrolled participants underwent screening with annual PSA, digital rectal examination (DRE), and triennial multiparametric MRI. Individuals with abnormal DRE, elevated age-adjusted PSA (>1.5 ng/ml for 35-49 yr, >2.0 ng/ml for 50-54 yr, and >3.0 ng/ml for 55-74 yr), or suspicious multiparametric MRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] >/=3 lesion) were offered prostate biopsy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Endpoints were diagnosis of any and clinically significant prostate cancer, and alternative screening strategies were compared by a decision curve analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: To date, 101 males have completed the first round of screening. The greatest proportion of participants are carriers of BRCA2 (n = 44), BRCA1 (n = 35), and ATM (n = 7) variants. Twenty-one have undergone biopsy, resulting in the detection of nine cases of cancer (seven clinically significant). For the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, abnormal MRI (PI-RADS >/=3) demonstrated 100% sensitivity (7/7) with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, whereas PSA-based screening alone had 57% (4/7) sensitivity with an NPV of 73%. Of six screening strategies evaluated in the decision curve analysis, MRI-based screening alone achieved superior net benefit at all threshold probabilities compared with PSA screening-detecting one additional cancer case per 7.5 patients, while avoiding more unnecessary biopsies at the same threshold probability. CONCLUSIONS: Disease prevalence is high among carriers of prostate cancer-associated pathogenic germline mutations. Early results suggest that MRI-based screening enhances early detection of clinically significant disease beyond PSA screening alone. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we present the interim results from the PROGRESS prostate cancer screening trial. We found that in certain germline carriers of prostate cancer risk mutations, magnetic resonance imaging-based screening enhances detection of prostate cancer while reducing biopsies triggered, in comparison with traditional prostate-specific antigen screening strategies."
38452717,Development and validation of a prognostic model for cervical cancer by combination of machine learning and high-throughput sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer holds the highest morbidity and mortality rates among female reproductive tract tumors. However, the curative outcomes for patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer remain unsatisfactory. There is a lack of comprehensive prognostic indicators for cervical cancer. This study aims to develop a model that evaluates the prognosis of cervical cancer in combination of high-throughput sequencing and various machine learning algorithms. METHODS: In this study, we combined two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) projects and TCGA data for cervical cancer to obtain shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A LASSO regression and several learners were applied for signature feature selection. Six machine learning algorithms including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were utilized to construct a prognostic model for cervical cancer. External validation was conducted using the CGCI-HTMCP-CC dataset, and the accuracy of the model was assessed through ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the successful construction of a prognostic model based on DEGs from bulk- and scRNA-seq data. Ten genes CXCL8, DLC1, GRN, MPLKIP, PRDX1, RUNX1, SNX3, TFRC, UBE2V2, and UQCRC1 were screened by feature selection and applied for model construction. Random Forest exhibited the best performance in predicting the risk of cervical cancer. Patients in the high-risk group presented worse overall survival compared to those in the low-risk group. CONCLUSION: Conclusively, our model based on DEGs from bulk-seq and scRNA-seq data effectively evaluates the prognosis of cervical cancer and provides valuable insights for comprehensive clinical management."
38452585,Beyond the genome: MALAT1's role in advancing urologic cancer care.,"Urologic cancers (UCs), which include bladder, kidney, and prostate tumors, account for almost a quarter of all malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are tissue-specific RNAs that influence cell growth, death, and division. LncRNAs are dysregulated in UCs, and their abnormal expression may allow them to be used in cancer detection, outlook, and therapy. With the identification of several novel lncRNAs and significant exploration of their functions in various illnesses, particularly cancer, the study of lncRNAs has evolved into a new obsession. MALAT1 is a flexible tumor regulator implicated in an array of biological activities and disorders, resulting in an important research issue. MALAT1 appears as a hotspot, having been linked to the dysregulation of cell communication, and is intimately linked to cancer genesis, advancement, and response to treatment. MALAT1 additionally operates as a competitive endogenous RNA, binding to microRNAs and resuming downstream mRNA transcription and operation. This regulatory system influences cell growth, apoptosis, motility, penetration, and cell cycle pausing. MALAT1's evaluation and prognosis significance are highlighted, with a thorough review of its manifestation levels in several UC situations and its association with clinicopathological markers. The investigation highlights MALAT1's adaptability as a possible treatment target, providing fresh ways for therapy in UCs as we integrate existing information The article not only gathers current knowledge on MALAT1's activities but also lays the groundwork for revolutionary advances in the treatment of UCs."
38451522,Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Risk Calculators to Predict Prostate Cancer Risk.,"IMPORTANCE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based risk calculators can replace or augment traditional prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction tools. However, few data are available comparing performance of different MRI-based risk calculators in external cohorts across different countries or screening paradigms. OBJECTIVE: To externally validate and compare MRI-based PCa risk calculators (Prospective Loyola University Multiparametric MRI [PLUM], UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]-Cornell, Van Leeuwen, and Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator-MRI [RPCRC-MRI]) in cohorts from Europe and North America. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multi-institutional, external validation diagnostic study of 3 unique cohorts was performed from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2022. Two cohorts from Europe and North America used MRI before biopsy, while a third cohort used an advanced serum biomarker, the Prostate Health Index (PHI), before MRI or biopsy. Participants included adult men without a PCa diagnosis receiving MRI before prostate biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: Prostate MRI followed by prostate biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was diagnosis of clinically significant PCa (grade group >/=2). Receiver operating characteristics for area under the curve (AUC) estimates, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 2181 patients across the 3 cohorts were included, with a median age of 65 (IQR, 58-70) years and a median prostate-specific antigen level of 5.92 (IQR, 4.32-8.94) ng/mL. All models had good diagnostic discrimination in the European cohort, with AUCs of 0.90 for the PLUM (95% CI, 0.86-0.93), UCLA-Cornell (95% CI, 0.86-0.93), Van Leeuwen (95% CI, 0.87-0.93), and RPCRC-MRI (95% CI, 0.86-0.93) models. All models had good discrimination in the North American cohort, with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) for PLUM and AUCs of 0.83 for the UCLA-Cornell (95% CI, 0.80-0.88), Van Leeuwen (95% CI, 0.79-0.88), and RPCRC-MRI (95% CI, 0.78-0.87) models, with somewhat better calibration for the RPCRC-MRI and PLUM models. In the PHI cohort, all models were prone to underestimate clinically significant PCa risk, with best calibration and discrimination for the UCLA-Cornell (AUC, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.81-0.85]) model, followed by the PLUM model (AUC, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.80-0.84]). The Van Leeuwen model was poorly calibrated in all 3 cohorts. On decision curve analysis, all models provided similar net benefit in the European cohort, with higher benefit for the PLUM and RPCRC-MRI models at a threshold greater than 22% in the North American cohort. The UCLA-Cornell model demonstrated highest net benefit in the PHI cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this external validation study of patients receiving MRI and prostate biopsy, the results support the use of the PLUM or RPCRC-MRI models in MRI-based screening pathways regardless of European or North American setting. However, tools specific to screening pathways incorporating advanced biomarkers as reflex tests are needed due to underprediction."
38450798,Defining the challenges and opportunities for using patient-derived models in prostate cancer research.,"BACKGROUND: There are relatively few widely used models of prostate cancer compared to other common malignancies. This impedes translational prostate cancer research because the range of models does not reflect the diversity of disease seen in clinical practice. In response to this challenge, research laboratories around the world have been developing new patient-derived models of prostate cancer, including xenografts, organoids, and tumor explants. METHODS: In May 2023, we held a workshop at the Monash University Prato Campus for researchers with expertise in establishing and using a variety of patient-derived models of prostate cancer. This review summarizes our collective ideas on how patient-derived models are currently being used, the common challenges, and future opportunities for maximizing their usefulness in prostate cancer research. RESULTS: An increasing number of patient-derived models for prostate cancer are being developed. Despite their individual limitations and varying success rates, these models are valuable resources for exploring new concepts in prostate cancer biology and for preclinical testing of potential treatments. Here we focus on the need for larger collections of models that represent the changing treatment landscape of prostate cancer, robust readouts for preclinical testing, improved in vitro culture conditions, and integration of the tumor microenvironment. Additional priorities include ensuring model reproducibility, standardization, and replication, and streamlining the exchange of models and data sets among research groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are several opportunities to maximize the impact of patient-derived models on prostate cancer research. We must develop large, diverse and accessible cohorts of models and more sophisticated methods for emulating the intricacy of patient tumors. In this way, we can use the samples that are generously donated by patients to advance the outcomes of patients in the future."
38450313,Genomic amplifications identified by circulating tumor DNA analysis guide prognosis in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) provides an opportunity to identify and monitor genomic alterations during a patient's treatment course. We evaluated whether the presence of specific gene amplifications (GAs) and plasma copy number (PCN) alterations are associated with disease features. METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective study of patients with mPC who underwent ctDNA profiling using Guardant360((R)) (Guardant Health Inc.). This test identifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and GAs of select genes by next-generation sequencing. A total of 155 men with mPC were studied. Patients were stratified by GA status. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate cox regression models were used to estimate overall survival (OS) or failure-free survival (FFS) from either the date of GA detection or the initiation of systemic therapy. The chi-square test was used to evaluate associations between clinical factors and GAs. RESULTS: The presence of liver and/or lung metastases was associated with GAs of BRAF, CDK6, PI3KCA, and FGFR1. Survival analyses were completed on a subset of 83 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Median OS was improved in patients with 1 GA compared to patients with >/=2 GAs, whether determined from the date of initial GA(s) detection (14.9 mo vs. 8.9 mo) or date of therapy initiation nearest to GA detection (16.7 mo vs. 9.0 mo). Patients without GAs had not reached median OS. Patients with androgen receptor (AR) GA only were also found to have better median OS compared to patients with AR GA plus at least one other additional GA (19.3 mo vs. 8.9 mo). Patients with PIK3CA GA had significantly lower median OS compared to patients with GAs that did not have a PIK3CA GA (5.9 mo vs. 16.0 mo). In patients with AR and/or MYC GA(s), median OS improved in those with reduced AR or MYC PCN during therapy compared to those without such a reduction (25.1 mo vs. 15.9 mo). CONCLUSIONS: The association of select GAs with survival provides an additional tool for assessing mCRPC prognosis and informing management. Serial monitoring of ctDNA GAs is also useful to guide prognosis and therapeutic response."
38449793,Extracellular cancer‑associated fibroblasts: A novel subgroup in the cervical cancer microenvironment that exhibits tumor‑promoting roles and prognosis biomarker functions.,"Tumor invasion and metastasis are the processes that primarily cause adverse outcomes in patients with cervical cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which participate in cancer progression and metastasis, are novel targets for the treatment of tumors. The present study aimed to assess the heterogeneity of CAFs in the cervical cancer microenvironment through single-cell RNA sequencing. After collecting five cervical cancer samples and obtaining the CAF-associated gene sets, the CAFs in the cervical cancer microenvironment were divided into myofibroblastic CAFs and extracellular (ec)CAFs. The ecCAFs appeared with more robust pro-tumorigenic effects than myCAFs according to enrichment analysis. Subsequently, through combining the ecCAF hub genes and bulk gene expression data for cervical cancer obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Ontology databases, univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses were performed to establish a CAF-associated risk signature for patients with cancer. The established risk signature demonstrated a stable and strong prognostic capability in both the training and validation cohorts. Subsequently, the association between the risk signature and clinical data was evaluated, and a nomogram to facilitate clinical application was established. The risk score was demonstrated to be associated with both the tumor immune microenvironment and the therapeutic responses. Moreover, the signature also has predictive value for the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and bladder urothelial carcinoma, which were also associated with human papillomavirus infection. In conclusion, the present study assessed the heterogeneity of CAFs in the cervical cancer microenvironment, and a subgroup of CAFs that may be closely associated with tumor progression was defined. Moreover, a signature based on the hub genes of ecCAFs was shown to have biomarker functionality in terms of predicting survival rates, and therefore this CAF subgroup may become a therapeutic target for cervical cancer in the future."
38448820,Characterisation and reproducibility of the HumanMethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip for DNA methylation profiling.,"BACKGROUND: The Illumina family of Infinium Methylation BeadChip microarrays has been widely used over the last 15 years for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, including large-scale and population-based studies, due to their ease of use and cost effectiveness. Succeeding the popular HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPICv1), the recently released Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip (EPICv2) claims to extend genomic coverage to more than 935,000 CpG sites. Here, we comprehensively characterise the reproducibility, reliability and annotation of the EPICv2 array, based on bioinformatic analysis of both manifest data and new EPICv2 data from diverse biological samples. RESULTS: We find a high degree of reproducibility with EPICv1, evidenced by comparable sensitivity and precision from empirical cross-platform comparison incorporating whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS), and high correlation between technical sample replicates, including between samples with DNA input levels below the manufacturer's recommendation. We provide a full assessment of probe content, evaluating genomic distribution and changes from previous array versions. We characterise EPICv2's new feature of replicated probes and provide recommendations as to the superior probes. In silico analysis of probe sequences demonstrates that probe cross-hybridisation remains a significant problem in EPICv2. By mapping the off-target sites at single nucleotide resolution and comparing with WGBS we show empirical evidence for preferential off-target binding. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we find EPICv2 a worthy successor to the previous Infinium methylation microarrays, however some technical issues remain. To support optimal EPICv2 data analysis we provide an expanded version of the EPICv2 manifest to aid researchers in understanding probe design, data processing, choosing appropriate probes for analysis and for integration with methylation datasets from previous versions of the Infinium Methylation BeadChip."
38447016,Revealing genes associated with cervical cancer in distinct immune cells: A comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Human papillomavirus can be contracted by sexually active women. However, only a small proportion of these infections persist and have the potential to progress into cervical cancers, indicating a significant involvement of the immune system in cervical cancer development. Despite this, our understanding of the precise contributions of genes from different immune cell types in cervical cancers remains limited. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to investigate the potential causal relationships between specific immune cell genes and the development of cervical cancers. By accessing expression quantitative trait loci datasets of 14 distinct immune cell types and genome wide association study of cervical cancers, we employed the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) along with multi-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based SMR to identify significant genes associated with cervical cancers. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to explore the shared genetic causality. A total of 10 genes across 11 immune cell types (26 significant gene-trait associations) were found to be associated with cervical cancers after false discovery rate correction. Notably, the ORMDL3, BRK1 and HMGN1 gene expression levels showed significant association with cervical cancer in specific immune cell types, respectively. These associations were supported by strong evidence of colocalization analyses. Our study has identified several genes in different immune cells that were associated with cervical cancer. However, further research is necessary to confirm these findings and provide more comprehensive insights into the association between these gene expressions and cervical cancer risk."
38446431,Unfurling the functional association between long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) and HPV16-related cervical cancer pathogenesis through weighted gene co-expression network analysis of differentially expressed lincRNAs and coding genes.,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) do not overlap annotated coding genes and are located in intergenic regions, as opposed to antisense and sense-intronic lncRNAs, located in genic regions. LincRNAs influence gene expression profiles and are thereby key to disease pathogenesis. In this study, we assessed the association between lincRNAs and HPV16-positive cervical cancer (CaCx) pathogenesis using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) with coding genes, comparing differentially expressed lincRNA and coding genes (DElincGs and DEcGs, respectively) in HPV16-positive patients with CaCx (n = 44) with those in HPV-negative healthy individuals (n = 34). Our analysis revealed five DElincG modules, co-expressing and correlating with DEcGs. We validated a substantial number of such module-specific correlations in the HPV16-positive cancer TCGA-CESC dataset. Four such modules, displayed significant correlations with patient traits, such as HPV16 physical status, lymph node involvement and overall survival (OS), highlighting a collaborative effect of all genes within specific modules on traits. Using the DAVID bioinformatics knowledgebase, we identified the underlying biological processes associated with these modules as cancer development and progression-associated pathways. Next, we identified the top 10 DElincGs with the highest connectivity within each functional module. Focusing on the prognostic module hub genes, downregulated CTD-2619J13.13 expression was associated with poor patient OS. This lincRNA gene interacted with 25 coding genes of its module and was associated with such biological processes as keratinization loss and keratinocyte differentiation, reflecting severe disease phenotypes. This study has translational relevance in fighting various cancers with high mortality rates in underdeveloped countries."
38445563,"The expression analysis of human endogenous retrovirus-K Env, Np9, and Rec transcripts in cervical cancer.","While infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types is necessary for cervical cancer (CC) development, it is not enough, and other risk factors are required. Several studies have reported the activation of HERV-K in different cancers; however, the investigation of HERV-K expression levels in CC is scarce. In this study, it was hypothesized that activation of HERV-K could play an essential role in CC development. In this order, the expression levels of HERV-K Env, Np9, and Rec transcripts were investigated on 147 normal to CC uterine cervical tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. The significantly higher levels of HERV-K Env and Np9 transcripts were found in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II-III and CC groups compared to those in the normal/CIN I group. Expression of Rec transcript was also higher only in the CC group than normal/CIN I group. Among CC patients, meaningfully higher levels of HERV-K Env and Np9 transcripts were found in patients with squamous cell carcinoma rather than in adenocarcinoma. When only the HPV 16 positive samples were investigated, it was found that the mean difference in Env and Np9 mRNA levels was meaningfully higher among precancer lesions and the cancer group in comparison with the normal group. However, the Rec mRNA level showed no significant differences. The association between the expression of HERV-K genes was investigated, and a significant positive correlation of Env expression with Np9 transcript was found only in the group with precancer lesions (R = 0.6, p = 0.0037). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between Rec and Np9 transcripts in patients with normal cervix tissues (R = 0.26, p = 0.033). However, no correlations were observed between the expression of Env and Rec in the three groups. In conclusion, our results showed that HERV-K transcripts, especially Env and Np9, upregulated during cervical lesion progression. These findings highlight the potential use of HERV-K Env and Np9 as biomarkers for CC diagnosis and prognosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the clinical utility of these markers and whether targeting HERV-K oncogenes could be a viable therapeutic strategy for CC."
38445371,Optimal systemic therapy in men with low-volume prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low-volume prostate cancer is an established prognostic category of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. However, the term is often loosely used to reflect the low burden of disease across different prostate cancer states. This review explores the definitions of low-volume prostate cancer, biology, and current evidence for treatment. We also explore future directions, including the impact of advanced imaging modalities, particularly prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) scans, on refining patient subgroups and treatment strategies for patients with low-volume prostate cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent investigations have attempted to redefine low-volume disease, incorporating factors beyond metastatic burden. Advanced imaging, especially PSMA PET, offers enhanced accuracy in detecting metastases, potentially challenging the conventional definition of low volume. The prognosis and treatment of low-volume prostate cancer may vary by the timing of metastatic presentation. Biomarker-directed consolidative therapy, metastases-directed therapy, and de-escalation of systemic therapies will be increasingly important, especially in patients with metachronous low-volume disease. SUMMARY: In the absence of validated biomarkers, the management of low-volume prostate cancer as defined by CHAARTED criteria may be guided by the timing of metastatic presentation. For metachronous low-volume disease, we recommend novel hormonal therapy (NHT) doublets with or without consolidative metastasis-directed therapy (MDT), and for synchronous low-volume disease, NHT doublets with or without consolidative MDT and prostate-directed radiation. Docetaxel triplets may be a reasonable alternative in some patients with synchronous presentation. There is no clear role of docetaxel doublets in patients with low-volume disease. In the future, a small subset of low-volume diseases with oligometastases selected by genomics and advanced imaging like PSMA PET may achieve long-term remission with MDT with no systemic therapy."
38443991,KLF7 regulates super-enhancer-driven IGF2BP2 overexpression to promote the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) is known for its high aggressiveness and susceptibility to cervical lymph node metastasis, which greatly contributes to its poor prognosis. During tumorigenesis, many types of cancer cells acquire oncogenic super-enhancers (SEs) that drive the overexpression of oncogenes, thereby maintaining malignant progression. This study aimed to identify and validate the role of oncogenic SE-associated genes in the malignant progression of HNSCC. METHODS: We identified HNSCC cell-specific SE-associated genes through H3K27Ac ChIP-seq and overlapped them with HNSCC-associated genes obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify hub genes. The expression of IGF2BP2 and KLF7 in HNSCC was detected using clinical samples. To determine the biological role of IGF2BP2, we performed CCK-8, colony formation assay, Transwell migration assay, invasion assay, and orthotopic xenograft model experiments. Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, small-molecule inhibitors, ChIP-qPCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assays to investigate the molecular mechanisms of IGF2BP2 and its upstream transcription factors. RESULTS: Our study identified IGF2BP2 as a hub SE-associated gene that exhibited aberrant expression in HNSCC tissues. Increased expression of IGF2BP2 was observed to be linked with malignant progression and unfavorable prognosis in HNSCC patients. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that IGF2BP2 promotes the tumorigenicity and metastasis of HNSCC by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, the IGF2BP2-SE region displayed enrichment for H3K27Ac, BRD4, and MED1, which led to the inhibition of IGF2BP2 transcription and expression through deactivation of the SE-associated transcriptional program. Additionally, KLF7 was found to induce the transcription of IGF2BP2 and directly bind to its promoter and SE regions. Moreover, the abundance of KLF7 exhibited a positive correlation with the abundance of IGF2BP2 in HNSCC. Patients with high expression of both KLF7 and IGF2BP2 showed poorer prognosis. Lastly, we demonstrated that the small molecule inhibitor JQ1, targeting BRD4, attenuated the proliferation and metastatic abilities of HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the critical role of IGF2BP2 overexpression mediated by SE and KLF7 in promoting HNSCC progression. Targeting SE-associated transcriptional programs may represent a potential therapeutic strategy in managing HNSCC."
38443832,Loss of chromosome Y in regulatory T cells.,"BACKGROUND: Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is the most prevalent somatic aneuploidy in aging humans. Men with LOY have increased risks of all-cause mortality and the major causes of death, including many forms of cancer. It has been suggested that the association between LOY and disease risk depends on what type of leukocyte is affected with Y loss, with prostate cancer patients showing higher levels of LOY in CD4 + T lymphocytes. In previous studies, Y loss has however been observed at relatively low levels in this cell type. This motivated us to investigate whether specific subsets of CD4 + T lymphocytes are particularly affected by LOY. Publicly available, T lymphocyte enriched, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from patients with liver, lung or colorectal cancer were used to study how LOY affects different subtypes of T lymphocyte. To validate the observations from the public data, we also generated a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset comprised of 23 PBMC samples and 32 CD4 + T lymphocytes enriched samples. RESULTS: Regulatory T cells had significantly more LOY than any other studied T lymphocytes subtype. Furthermore, LOY in regulatory T cells increased the ratio of regulatory T cells compared with other T lymphocyte subtypes, indicating an effect of Y loss on lymphocyte differentiation. This was supported by developmental trajectory analysis of CD4 + T lymphocytes culminating in the regulatory T cells cluster most heavily affected by LOY. Finally, we identify dysregulation of 465 genes in regulatory T cells with Y loss, many involved in the immunosuppressive functions and development of regulatory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we show that regulatory T cells are particularly affected by Y loss, resulting in an increased fraction of regulatory T cells and dysregulated immune functions. Considering that regulatory T cells plays a critical role in the process of immunosuppression; this enrichment for regulatory T cells with LOY might contribute to the increased risk for cancer observed among men with Y loss in leukocytes."
38442920,Patient-Derived Tumor Xenograft Study with CDK4/6 Inhibitor Plus AKT Inhibitor for the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor outcomes. To investigate novel therapeutic strategies, we characterized three new metastatic prostate cancer patient derived-tumor xenograft (PDTX) models and developed 3D spheroids from each to investigate molecular targeted therapy combinations including CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with AKT inhibitors (ATKi). Metastatic prostate cancer tissue was collected and three PDTX models were established and characterized using whole-exome sequencing. PDTX 3D spheroids were developed from these three PDTXs to show resistance patterns and test novel molecular-targeted therapies. CDK4/6i's were combined with AKTi's to assess synergistic antitumor response to prove our hypothesis that blockade of AKT overcomes drug resistance to CDK4/6i. This combination was evaluated in PDTX three-dimensional (3D) spheroids and in vivo experiments with responses measured by tumor volumes, PSA, and Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT imaging. We demonstrated CDK4/6i's with AKTi's possess synergistic antitumor activity in three mCRPC PDTX models. These models have multiple unique pathogenic and deleterious genomic alterations with resistance to single-agent CDK4/6i's. Despite this, combination therapy with AKTi's was able to overcome resistance mechanisms. The IHC and Western blot analysis confirmed on target effects, whereas tumor volume, serum PSA ELISA, and radionuclide imaging demonstrated response to therapy with statistically significant SUV differences seen with Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. These preclinical data demonstrating antitumor synergy by overcoming single-agent CDK 4/6i as well as AKTi drug resistance provide the rational for a clinical trial combining a CDK4/6i with an AKTi in patients with mCRPC whose tumor expresses wild-type retinoblastoma 1."
38442272,VEGF-C prophylaxis favors lymphatic drainage and modulates neuroinflammation in a stroke model.,"Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) promote tissue clearance and immune surveillance in the central nervous system (CNS). Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) regulates MLV development and maintenance and has therapeutic potential for treating neurological disorders. Herein, we investigated the effects of VEGF-C overexpression on brain fluid drainage and ischemic stroke outcomes in mice. Intracerebrospinal administration of an adeno-associated virus expressing mouse full-length VEGF-C (AAV-mVEGF-C) increased CSF drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) by enhancing lymphatic growth and upregulated neuroprotective signaling pathways identified by single nuclei RNA sequencing of brain cells. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, AAV-mVEGF-C pretreatment reduced stroke injury and ameliorated motor performances in the subacute stage, associated with mitigated microglia-mediated inflammation and increased BDNF signaling in brain cells. Neuroprotective effects of VEGF-C were lost upon cauterization of the dCLN afferent lymphatics and not mimicked by acute post-stroke VEGF-C injection. We conclude that VEGF-C prophylaxis promotes multiple vascular, immune, and neural responses that culminate in a protection against neurological damage in acute ischemic stroke."
38441550,Single-cell RNA combined with bulk RNA analysis to explore oxidative stress and energy metabolism factors and found a new prostate cancer oncogene MXRA8.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men worldwide, and its diagnosis and treatment are challenging due to its heterogeneity. METHODS: Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data, we identified two molecular subtypes of prostate cancer based on dysregulated genes involved in oxidative stress and energy metabolism. We constructed a risk score model (OMR) using common differentially expressed genes, which effectively evaluated prostate cancer prognosis. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the risk score model and various factors, including tumor immune microenvironment, genomic variations, chemotherapy resistance, and immune response. Notably, patients with low-risk scores exhibited increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy compared to those with high-risk scores, indicating the model's potential to predict patient response to treatment. Additionally, our investigation of MXRA8 in prostate cancer showed significant upregulation of this gene in the disease as confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays including CCK-8, transwell, plate cloning, and ROS generation assay demonstrated that depletion of MXRA8 reduced the proliferative, invasive, migratory capabilities of PC-3 cells, as well as their ROS generation capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the potential of oxidative stress and energy metabolism-related genes as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. The integration of scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data enables a better understanding of prostate cancer heterogeneity and promotes personalized treatment development. Additionally, we identified a novel oncogene MXRA8 in prostate cancer."
38441026,"ZNF695, A Potential Prognostic Biomarker, Correlates with Im mune Infiltrates in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endoce rvical Adenocarcinoma: Bioinformatic Analysis and Experimental Verification.","BACKGROUND: The role of Zinc Finger Protein 695 (ZNF695) is unclear in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis and experimental validation of ZNF695 in CESC. METHODS: The study investigated the expression of ZNF695 in both pan-cancer and CESC, utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to assess its diagnostic value. The present study investigated the association between ZNF695 expression levels and clinical characteristics, as well as prognosis, in patients with CESC. The study explored potential regulatory networks involving ZNF695, including its association with immune infiltration, immune score, stemness index based on mRNA expression (mRNAsi), and drug sensitivity in CESC. We explored the expression of ZNF695 in CESC single cells. ZNF695 expression was validated using GSE29570. RESULTS: ZNF695 was found to be aberrantly expressed in pan-cancer and CESC. There was a significant correlation observed between an elevated level of ZNF695 expression in patients with CESC and histological grade (p = 0.017). Furthermore, a strong association was found between high ZNF695 expression in CESC patients and poorer overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.17-3.00; p = 0.009), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.16-2.98; p = 0.010), and Disease-specific Survival (DSS) (HR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.15-3.42; p = 0.014). The expression of ZNF695 in CESC patients (p = 0.006) was identified as an independent prognostic determinant. ZNF695 was associated with steroid hormone biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and so on. ZNF695 expression correlated with immune infiltration, immune score, and mRNAsi in CESC. ZNF695 expression significantly and negatively correlated with AICA ribonucleotide, BIX02189, QL-XI-92, STF-62247, and SNX-2112 in CESC. ZNF695 gene was upregulated in CESC tissues and cell lines. ZNF695 was significantly upregulated in the CESC cell lines. CONCLUSION: ZNF695 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and immunotherapeutic target for CESC patients."
38438956,Radiogenomic analysis of ultrasound phenotypic features coupled to proteomes predicts metastatic risk in primary prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Primary prostate cancer with metastasis has a poor prognosis, so assessing its risk of metastasis is essential. METHODS: This study combined comprehensive ultrasound features with tissue proteomic analysis to obtain biomarkers and practical diagnostic image features that signify prostate cancer metastasis. RESULTS: In this study, 17 ultrasound image features of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), primary prostate cancer without metastasis (PPCWOM), and primary prostate cancer with metastasis (PPCWM) were comprehensively analyzed and combined with the corresponding tissue proteome data to perform weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which resulted in two modules highly correlated with the ultrasound phenotype. We screened proteins with temporal expression trends based on the progression of the disease from BPH to PPCWOM and ultimately to PPCWM from two modules and obtained a protein that can promote prostate cancer metastasis. Subsequently, four ultrasound image features significantly associated with the metastatic biomarker HNRNPC (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C) were identified by analyzing the correlation between the protein and ultrasound image features. The biomarker HNRNPC showed a significant difference in the five-year survival rate of prostate cancer patients (p < 0.0053). On the other hand, we validated the diagnostic efficiency of the four ultrasound image features in clinical data from 112 patients with PPCWOM and 150 patients with PPCWM, obtaining a combined diagnostic AUC of 0.904. In summary, using ultrasound imaging features for predicting whether prostate cancer is metastatic has many applications. CONCLUSION: The above study reveals noninvasive ultrasound image biomarkers and their underlying biological significance, which provide a basis for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of primary prostate cancer with metastasis."
38435029,Transcriptome Analysis Identifies Tumor Immune Microenvironment Signaling Networks Supporting Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cause of cancer death in American men. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is the most lethal form of PCa and preferentially metastasizes to the bones through incompletely understood molecular mechanisms. Herein, we processed RNA sequencing data from patients with mCRPC (n = 60) and identified 14 gene clusters (modules) highly correlated with mCRPC bone metastasis. We used a novel combination of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and upstream regulator and gene ontology analyses of clinically annotated transcriptomes to identify the genes. The cyan module (M14) had the strongest positive correlation (0.81, p = 4 x 10(-15)) with mCRPC bone metastasis. It was associated with two significant biological pathways through KEGG enrichment analysis (parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion, and action and protein digestion and absorption). In particular, we identified 10 hub genes (ALPL, PHEX, RUNX2, ENPP1, PHOSPHO1, PTH1R, COL11A1, COL24A1, COL22A1, and COL13A1) using cytoHubba of Cytoscape. We also found high gene expression for collagen formation, degradation, absorption, cell-signaling peptides, and bone regulation processes through Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis."
38434980,Causal Relationship between Immune Cells and Gynecological Cancers through Bidirectional and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,"Background: Evidence suggests potential associations between gynecological malignancies and various immune cell chemicals and systems. However, establishing a causal relationship remains uncertain. Methods: This work employed Wald ratio for one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or the inverse-variance weighted method (IVW) for multiple SNPs to conduct bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis by utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. We employed supplementary methods, including MR-Egger and weighted median methods, to detect and correct for the influence of horizontal pleiotropy. In addition, we also use colocalization analysis for further validation. Results: In IVW analysis, increases in relative count of circulating CD11c(+) HLA-DR(++) conventional dendritic cells (cDC) were associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer (OR [95% CI], 1.1295 [1.0632-1.2000], P = 8.044 x 10(-5)), while elevated levels of HLA-DR on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) and HLA-DR on DC were protective against breast cancer. In addition, actual count of CD39(+) resting Treg AC was also shown to be causally associated with the development of ovarian cancer, whereas a high relative count of CD28(+) CD45RA(-) CD8(+) T cells reduced the risk of cervical cancer. Sensitivity analysis revealed almost no evidence of bias in the current study. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses further confirmed a direct impact of the CD11c(+) HLA-DR(++) cDC immune phenotype on breast cancer. Colocalization analysis showed the lead SNP, rs780094, suggesting HLA-DR GWAS shared a common genetic mechanism with breast cancer. Conclusions: The MR study identified significant causal relationships between multiple immunophenotypes and breast cancer, aiming to provide clinicians with some reference for cancer prediction and explore further potential associations between immune phenotypes and gynecologic tumors."
38434685,Genetic prediction of the causal relationship between schizophrenia and tumors: a Mendelian randomized study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia are at a higher risk of developing cancer. However, the causal relationship between schizophrenia and different tumor types remains unclear. METHODS: Using a two-sample, two-way Mendelian randomization method, we used publicly available genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) aggregate data to study the causal relationship between schizophrenia and different cancer risk factors. These tumors included lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, alcohol-related hepatocellular cancer, tumors involving the lungs, breast, thyroid gland, pancreas, prostate, ovaries and cervix, endometrium, colon and colorectum, and bladder. We used the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method to determine the causal relationship between schizophrenia and different tumor risk factors. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity test to evaluate the effectiveness of the causality. RESULTS: After adjusting for heterogeneity, evidence of a causal relationship between schizophrenia and lung cancer risk was observed (odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.000-1.001; P=0.0155). In the sensitivity analysis, the causal effect of schizophrenia on the risk of lung cancer was consistent in both direction and degree. However, no evidence of causality or reverse causality between schizophrenia and other tumors was found. CONCLUSION: This study elucidated a causal relationship between the genetic predictors of schizophrenia and the risk of lung cancer, thereby providing a basis for the prevention, pathogenesis, and treatment of schizophrenia in patients with lung cancer."
38433714,Development of Novel Models of Aggressive Variants of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Genomic studies have identified new subsets of aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) with poor prognosis (eg, neuroendocrine prostate cancer [NEPC], PCa with DNA damage response [DDR] alterations, or PCa resistant to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors [ARPIs]). Development of novel therapies relies on the availability of relevant preclinical models. OBJECTIVE: To develop new preclinical models (patient-derived xenograft [PDX], PDX-derived organoid [PDXO], and patient-derived organoid [PDO]) representative of the most aggressive variants of PCa and to develop a new drug evaluation strategy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: NEPC (n = 5), DDR (n = 7), and microsatellite instability (MSI)-high (n = 1) PDXs were established from 51 patients with metastatic PCa; PDXOs (n = 16) and PDOs (n = 6) were developed to perform drug screening. Histopathology and treatment response were characterized. Molecular profiling was performed by whole-exome sequencing (WES; n = 13), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; n = 13), and single-cell RNA-seq (n = 14). WES and RNA-seq data from patient tumors were compared with the models. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Relationships with outcome were analyzed using the multivariable chi-square test and the tumor growth inhibition test. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Our PDXs captured both common and rare molecular phenotypes and their molecular drivers, including alterations of BRCA2, CDK12, MSI-high status, and NEPC. RNA-seq profiling demonstrated broad representation of PCa subtypes. Single-cell RNA-seq indicates that PDXs reproduce cellular and molecular intratumor heterogeneity. WES of matched patient tumors showed preservation of most genetic driver alterations. PDXOs and PDOs preserve drug sensitivity of the matched tissue and can be used to determine drug sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our models reproduce the phenotypic and genomic features of both common and aggressive PCa variants and capture their molecular heterogeneity. Successfully developed aggressive-variant PCa preclinical models provide an important tool for predicting tumor response to anticancer therapy and studying resistance mechanisms. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at the outcomes of preclinical models from patients with metastatic prostate cancer enrolled in the MATCH-R trial (NCT02517892)."
38433226,Plasma metabolites and risk of seven cancers: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study among European descendants.,"BACKGROUND: While circulating metabolites have been increasingly linked to cancer risk, the causality underlying these associations remains largely uninterrogated. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the potential causal relationship between 913 plasma metabolites and the risk of seven cancers among European-ancestry individuals. Data on variant-metabolite associations were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma metabolites among 14,296 subjects. Data on variant-cancer associations were gathered from large-scale GWAS consortia for breast (N = 266,081), colorectal (N = 185,616), lung (N = 85,716), ovarian (N = 63,347), prostate (N = 140,306), renal cell (N = 31,190), and testicular germ cell (N = 28,135) cancers. MR analyses were performed with the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method as the primary strategy to identify significant associations at Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05 for each cancer type separately. Significant associations were subjected to additional scrutiny via weighted median MR, Egger regression, MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and reverse MR analyses. Replication analyses were performed using an independent dataset from a plasma metabolite GWAS including 8,129 participants of European ancestry. RESULTS: We identified 94 significant associations, suggesting putative causal associations between 66 distinct plasma metabolites and the risk of seven cancers. Remarkably, 68.2% (45) of these metabolites were each associated with the risk of a specific cancer. Among the 66 metabolites, O-methylcatechol sulfate and 4-vinylphenol sulfate demonstrated the most pronounced positive and negative associations with cancer risk, respectively. Genetically proxied plasma levels of these two metabolites were significantly associated with the risk of lung cancer and renal cell cancer, with an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of 2.81 (2.33-3.37) and 0.49 (0.40-0.61), respectively. None of these 94 associations was biased by weak instruments, horizontal pleiotropy, or reverse causation. Further, 64 of these 94 were eligible for replication analyses, and 54 (84.4%) showed P < 0.05 with association patterns consistent with those shown in primary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study unveils plausible causal relationships between 66 plasma metabolites and cancer risk, expanding our understanding of the role of circulating metabolites in cancer genetics and etiology. These findings hold promise for enhancing cancer risk assessment and prevention strategies, meriting further exploration."
38432581,CRISPR/Cas9 screenings unearth protein arginine methyltransferase 7 as a novel essential gene in prostate cancer metastasis.,"Due to the limited effectiveness of current treatments, the survival rate of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is significantly reduced. Consequently, it is imperative to identify novel therapeutic targets for managing these patients. Since the invasive ability of cells is crucial for establishing and maintaining metastasis, the aim of this study was to identify the essential regulators of invasive abilities of mCRPC cells by conducting two independent high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screenings. Furthermore, some of the top hits were validated using siRNA technology, with protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) emerging as the most promising candidate. We demonstrated that its inhibition or depletion via genetic or pharmacological approaches significantly reduces invasive, migratory and proliferative abilities of mCRPC cells in vitro. Moreover, we confirmed that PRMT7 ablation reduces cell dissemination in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse xenograft assays. Molecularly, PRMT7 reprograms the expression of several adhesion molecules by methylating various transcription factors, such as FoxK1, resulting in the loss of adhesion from the primary tumor and increased motility of mCRPC cells. Furthermore, PRMT7 higher expression correlates with tumor aggressivity and poor overall survival in prostate cancer patients. Thus, this study demonstrates that PRMT7 is a potential therapeutic target and potential biomarker for mPCa."
38432114,Genomic profiles and their relationships with clinical characteristics and immune features in cervical cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the genomic alteration profiles of cervical cancer patients, examine the correlation between mutation patterns and clinical and immune attributes, and discover novel targets for treatment of individuals with cervical cancer. METHODS: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing of tumor tissues and blood samples obtained from 45 cervical cancer patients to analyze somatic alterations, mutation patterns, and HLA alleles comprehensively. Additionally, we used flow cytometry to assess expression levels of immune checkpoint genes. RESULTS: Notably, genes such as AR (78%), KMT2D (76%), and NOTCH1 (62%) exhibited higher mutation frequencies. Moreover, the tumor mutation burden (TMB) was significantly greater in HPV-positive cervical cancer patients than in HPV-negative patients (P=0.029). BMI (P=0.047) and mutations in BARD1 (P=0.034), CEP290 (P=4E-04), and SLX4 (P=0.0128) were identified as predictors of shorter overall survival in cervical cancer patients. Furthermore, the present study revealed significant upregulation of PD-1 (P=0.027) and Tim-3 (P=0.048) in the high mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) cohort. In the elderly cervical cancer patient population, HLA-A03:01 emerged as a high-risk allele (OR=3.2, P<0.0001); HLA-C07:02 (OR=0.073, P=0.02) and HLA-B*07:02 (OR=0.257, P=0.037) were associated with a reduced risk among patients with low TMB. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the mutation characteristics of cervical cancer patients and identifies potential therapeutic."
38431915,Causal relationship between gut microbiota and prostate cancer contributes to the gut-prostate axis: insights from a Mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Changes in gut microbiota abundance have been linked to prostate cancer development. However, the causality of the gut-prostate axis remains unclear. METHODS: The genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for gut microbiota sourced from MiBioGen (n = 14,306), alongside prostate cancer summary data from PRACTICAL (n = 140,254) and FinnGen Consortium (n = 133,164). Inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) was mainly used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (Cl), after diligently scrutinizing potential sources of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy via the rigorous utilization of Cochran's Q test, the MR-PRESSO method, and MR-Egger. We used meta-analysis methods in random effects to combine the Mendelian randomization (MR) estimates from the two sources. RESULTS: The pooled analyses of MR results show that genus Eubacterium fissicatena (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13, P = 0.011) and genus Odoribacter (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27, P = 0.025) were positively associated with prostate cancer. However, genus Adlercreutzia (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, P = 0.002), Roseburia (OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99, P = 0.03), Holdemania (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97, P = 0.005), Flavonifractor (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98, P = 0.024) and Allisonella (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98, P = 0.011) seems to be a protective factor for prostate cancer. Sensitivity analysis found no significant heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, or reverse causal links in all causal associations. CONCLUSION: This MR study lends support to a causal relationship between genetically predicted gut microbiota and prostate cancer. Research on the gut-prostate axis, along with further multi-omics analyses, holds significant implications for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer."
38430206,Global acetylome profiling indicates EPA impedes but OA promotes prostate cancer motility through altered acetylation of PFN1 and FLNA.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality in men. Metastasis is the main cause of PCa-associated death. Recent evidence indicated a significant reduction in PCa mortality associated with higher omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) consumption. However, the underlying mechanisms remained elusive. In this study, we applied global acetylome profiling to study the effect of fatty acids treatment. Results indicated that oleic acid (OA, monounsaturated fatty acid, MUFA, 100 microM) elevates while EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 100 microM) reduces the acetyl-CoA level, which alters the global acetylome. After treatment, two crucial cell motility regulators, PFN1 and FLNA, were found with altered acetylation levels. OA increased the acetylation of PFN1 and FLNA, whereas EPA decreased PFN1 acetylation level. Furthermore, OA promotes while EPA inhibits PCa migration and invasion. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that EPA impedes the formation of lamellipodia or filopodia through reduced localization of PFN1 and FLNA to the leading edge of cells. Therefore, perturbed acetylome may be one critical step in fatty acid-affected cancer cell motility. This study provides some new insights into the response of omega-3 PUFAs treatment and a better understanding of cancer cell migration and invasion modulation."
38429210,"Development and Independent Validation of a Prognostic Gene Expression Signature Based on RB1, PTEN, and TP53 in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients.","BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel (D) and/or antiandrogen receptor therapies (ARTs) are the standard therapies in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Alterations in the tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) RB1, PTEN, and TP53 are associated with an aggressive evolution and treatment resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical implications of TSG mRNA expression in mHSPC patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a multicenter retrospective biomarker study in mHSPC patients. TSG(low) status was defined when two or more out of the three TSGs presented low RNA expression by nCounter in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and TSG(wt) for the remaining cases. The microarray data from the CHAARTED trial were analyzed as an independent validation cohort. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Molecular data were correlated with CRPC-free survival (CRPC-FS) and overall survival (OS) by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 226 patients were included, of whom 218 were eligible: 93 were treated with ADT and 125 with ADT + D; 75.7% presented de novo stage IV and 67.9% high-volume disease. TSG(low) (19.2%) was independently correlated with shorter CRPC-FS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, p = 0.002) and OS (HR 2, p = 0.002). In the CHAARTED trial, TSG(low) was independently correlated with lower CRPC-FS (HR 2.2, p = 0.02); no differences in clinical outcomes according to treatment were observed in TSG(low) patients, while a significant benefit was observed for ADT + D in the TSG(wt) group for CRPC-FS (HR 0.4, p < 0.001) and OS (HR 0.4, p = 0.001). However, no interaction was observed between TSG signature and treatment in either series. Study limitations are the retrospective design, small sample size, and lack of inclusion of patients treated with ADT + ART. CONCLUSIONS: TSG(low) expression correlates with adverse outcomes in patients with mHSPC. The investigation of new therapeutic strategies in these patients is warranted. PATIENT SUMMARY: The low RNA expression of tumor suppressor genes in the tumors is correlated with adverse outcomes in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer."
38428891,Brain metastasis in a patient with BRCA2-mutated treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma and long-term response to radiotherapy and Olaparib: A case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: A new subtype of prostate cancer called treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma (t-NEPC) was added to the revised World Health Organization classification of prostate cancer in 2022. t-NEPC cases are increasing, and there is no established standard treatment. METHODS: A 49-year-old male patient was referred to our department for dysuria. A rectal examination and a prostate biopsy revealed stony hardness and prostate adenocarcinoma, respectively. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of multiple bone and lymph node metastases. The patient was started on upfront treatment with androgen deprivation therapy and an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, which resulted in a significant (>90%) decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The patient experienced postrenal failure 6 months later, attributable to local disease progression. Concurrently, there was an elevation in neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels and an enlargement of pelvic lymph node metastases, without PSA progression. RESULTS: Biopsy specimen for cancer genome profiling revealed deletion of BRCA 2 and PTEN, AR amplification, and the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene. Based on increased NSE and BRCA2 mutations, a diagnosis of t-NEPC with BRCA2 mutation was eventually made. The patient received docetaxel chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy. Subsequently, he was treated with olaparib. His NSE levels decreased, and he achieved a complete response (CR). However, 18 months following the olaparib administration, brain metastases appeared despite the absence of pelvic tumor relapse, and the patient's PSA levels remained low. Consequently, the patient underwent resection of the brain metastases using gamma knife and whole-brain radiotherapy but died approximately 3 months later. CONCLUSION SUBSECTIONS: Platinum-based chemotherapy is often administered for the treatment of t-NEPC, but there are few reports on the effectiveness of olaparib in patients with BRCA2 mutations. In a literature review, this case demonstrated the longest duration of effectiveness with olaparib alone without platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, the occurrence of relatively rare, fatal brain metastases in prostate cancer after a long period of CR suggests the necessity of regular brain imaging examinations."
38428419,Genomic evolution shapes prostate cancer disease type.,"The development of cancer is an evolutionary process involving the sequential acquisition of genetic alterations that disrupt normal biological processes, enabling tumor cells to rapidly proliferate and eventually invade and metastasize to other tissues. We investigated the genomic evolution of prostate cancer through the application of three separate classification methods, each designed to investigate a different aspect of tumor evolution. Integrating the results revealed the existence of two distinct types of prostate cancer that arise from divergent evolutionary trajectories, designated as the Canonical and Alternative evolutionary disease types. We therefore propose the evotype model for prostate cancer evolution wherein Alternative-evotype tumors diverge from those of the Canonical-evotype through the stochastic accumulation of genetic alterations associated with disruptions to androgen receptor DNA binding. Our model unifies many previous molecular observations, providing a powerful new framework to investigate prostate cancer disease progression."
38428412,Retinoic acid receptor activation reprograms senescence response and enhances anti-tumor activity of natural killer cells.,"Cellular senescence can exert dual effects in tumors, either suppressing or promoting tumor progression. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), released by senescent cells, plays a crucial role in this dichotomy. Consequently, the clinical challenge lies in developing therapies that safely enhance senescence in cancer, favoring tumor-suppressive SASP factors over tumor-promoting ones. Here, we identify the retinoic-acid-receptor (RAR) agonist adapalene as an effective pro-senescence compound in prostate cancer (PCa). Reactivation of RARs triggers a robust senescence response and a tumor-suppressive SASP. In preclinical mouse models of PCa, the combination of adapalene and docetaxel promotes a tumor-suppressive SASP that enhances natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor clearance more effectively than either agent alone. This approach increases the efficacy of the allogenic infusion of human NK cells in mice injected with human PCa cells, suggesting an alternative therapeutic strategy to stimulate the anti-tumor immune response in ""immunologically cold"" tumors."
38428338,Phylogenomic and molecular markers based studies on clarifying the evolutionary relationships among Peptoniphilus species. Identification of several Genus-Level clades of Peptoniphilus species and transfer of some Peptoniphilus species to the genus Aedoeadaptatus.,"To clarify the evolutionary relationships among Peptoniphilus species, whose members show association with increased risk for prostate cancer, detailed phylogenomic and comparative analyses were conducted on their genome sequences. In phylogenetic trees based on core genome proteins and 16S rRNA gene sequences, Peptoniphilus species formed eight distinct clades, with Aedoeadaptatus and Anaerosphaera species branching between them. The observed clades designated as Peptoniphilus sensu stricto (encompassing its type species), Harei, Lacrimalis, Duerdenii, Mikwangii, Stercorisuis, Catoniae and Aedoeadaptatus, show genus level divergence based on 16S rRNA similarity and average amino acid identity (AAI). The Genome Taxonomy Database also assigns most of these clades to distinct taxa. Several Peptoniphilus species (viz. P. coxii, P. ivorii, P. nemausensis and some non-validly published species) grouped reliably with the type species of Aedoeadaptatus (A. acetigenes) and are affiliated to this genus based on 16S rRNA similarity, AAI, and multiple uniquely shared molecular signatures. Hence, we are proposing the transfer of these species into the emended genus Aedoeadaptatus. Our analyses on protein sequences from Peptoniphilus genomes have also identified 54 novel molecular markers consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs), which are specific for different Peptoniphilus species clades and provide reliable means for their demarcation in molecular terms. Lastly, we also show that based on the shared presence of these CSIs in the genomes of uncharacterized Peptoniphilus spp. (cultured and uncultured), their affiliations to the specific Peptoniphilus clades can be accurately predicted. These results should prove useful in understanding the potential involvement of Peptoniphilus-related species in diseases."
38427070,A rare Ewing-like small round cell tumor in prostate: a case report and literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Small round cell tumor (SRCT) is a group of malignancy with similar optical microscopic morphology. Despite its low incidence, SRCT has a high malignant degree and poor prognosis. Besides, atypical clinical symptoms make it difficult in preoperative diagnosis. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old man was presented to the outpatient service with dysuria and weak urine stream lasting for 3 months. After oral treatment with tamsulosin and finasteride for 2 months, the symptoms worsen. Transurethral prostate holmium laser enucleation was operated and postoperative pathology result revealed small blue round cell malignant tumor. Further immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization examination indicated Ewing-like SRCT. So a Da Vinci Robotic prostatectomy was performed further and whole-genome sequencing was conducted. Several gene mutations including RAF1, ARID1A, SMARCA4, and BCL2L11 were found but no FDA-approved drug could treat specifically. Then the patient received Ewing-type therapeutic regimens treatment and has been followed up to date (over 24 months). CONCLUSION: Because of its non-elevated serum PSA level, prostate SRCT is often ignored as a possibility of malignant tumor and regarded as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The possibility of prostate SRCT need to be considered if dysuria symptoms could not alleviate significantly after a period of oral treatment."
38425504,Carboplatin in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with molecular alterations of the DNA damage repair pathway: the PRO-CARBO phase II trial.,"INTRODUCTION: DNA damage repair genes are altered in 20-35% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Poly-ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) showed significant activity for these selected tumors, especially with homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency. These alterations could also predict platinum sensitivity. Although carboplatin was inconclusive in unselected mCRPC, the literature suggests an anti-tumoral activity in mCRPC with HHR gene alterations. We aimed to assess the efficacy of carboplatin monotherapy in mCRPC patients with HRR deficiency. METHODS: This prospective multicenter single-arm two-stage phase II addressed mCRPC men with HRR somatic and/or germline alterations, pretreated with ⩾2 taxane chemotherapy regimens and one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. Prior PARPi treatment was allowed. Enrolled patients received intravenous carboplatin (AUC5) every 21 days for 6-9 cycles. The primary endpoint was the best response rate according to adapted PCWG3 guidelines: radiological response (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and/or biological response [⩾50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline]. RESULTS: A total of 15 out of 16 enrolled patients started carboplatin treatment. Genomic alterations were identified for BRCA2 (n = 5), CDK12 (n = 3), ATM (n = 3) CHEK2 (n = 2), CHEK1 (n = 1), and BRCA1 (n = 1) genes. Objective response (partial biological response + stable radiological response) was achieved in one patient (6.7%), carrying a BRCA2 mutation and not pre-treated with PARPi; stable disease was observed for five patients (33.5%). Among seven patients (46.7%) with previous PARPi treatment, four patients (57.1%) had a stable disease. The median progression-free and overall survivals were 1.9 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.8-9.5] and 8.6 months (95% CI, 4.3-19.5), respectively. The most common severe (grade 3-4) treatment-related toxicities were thrombocytopenia (66.7%), anemia (66.7%), and nausea (60%). Overall, 8 (53.3%) patients experienced a severe hematological event. CONCLUSION: The study was prematurely stopped as pre-planned considering the limited activity of carboplatin monotherapy in heavily pre-treated, HHR-deficient mCRPC patients. Larger experience is needed in mCRPC with BRCA alterations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03652493, EudraCT ID number 2017-004764-35."
38424044,MYC induces CDK4/6 inhibitors resistance by promoting pRB1 degradation.,"CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) show anticancer activity in certain human malignancies, such as breast cancer. However, their application to other tumor types and intrinsic resistance mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that MYC amplification confers resistance to CDK4/6i in bladder, prostate and breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, MYC binds to the promoter of the E3 ubiquitin ligase KLHL42 and enhances its transcription, leading to RB1 deficiency by inducing both phosphorylated and total pRB1 ubiquitination and degradation. We identify a compound that degrades MYC, A80.2HCl, which induces MYC degradation at nanomolar concentrations, restores pRB1 protein levels and re-establish sensitivity of MYC high-expressing cancer cells to CDK4/6i. The combination of CDK4/6i and A80.2HCl result in marked regression in tumor growth in vivo. Altogether, these results reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying MYC-induced resistance to CDK4/6i and suggest the utilization of the MYC degrading molecule A80.2HCl to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of CDK4/6i."
38423595,Impact of Tumor Grade Distribution on Genetic Alterations in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma and Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: A genomic analysis based on next-generation sequencing is important for deciding cancer treatment strategies. Cancer tissue sometimes displays intratumor heterogeneity and a pathologic specimen may contain more than two tumor grades. Although tumor grades are very important for the cancer prognosis, the impact of higher tumor grade distribution in a specimen used for a genomic analysis is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 61 clear cell carcinoma and 46 prostate cancer patients that were diagnosed between December 2018 and August 2022 using the GeneRead Human Comprehensive Cancer Panel or SureSelect PrePool custom Tier2. Genome annotation and curation were performed using the GenomeJack software. RESULTS: Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was increased in proportion to the higher tumor grade distribution in grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In PC, Grade Group 3/4 specimens that included an increased distribution of Gleason pattern 4 had more frequent gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the importance of selecting the maximum distribution of higher tumor grade areas to obtain results on the precise gene alterations for genomics-focused treatments."
38419642,The causal correlation between gut microbiota abundance and pathogenesis of cervical cancer: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study.,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies and animal experiments suggested potential relevance between gut microbiota (GM) and cervical cancer (CC), but the relevance of this association remains to be clarified. METHODS: We performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore whether there was a causal correlation between GM and CC, and the direction of causality. RESULTS: In primary outcomes, we found that a higher abundance of class Clostridia, family Family XI, genus Alloprevotella, genus Ruminiclostridium 9, and order Clostridiales predicted higher risk of CC, and a higher abundance of class Lentisphaeria, family Acidaminococcaceae, genus Christensenellaceae R7 group, genus Marvinbryantia, order Victivallales, phylum Actinobacteria, and phylum Lentisphaerae predicted lower risk of CC. During verifiable outcomes, we found that a higher abundance of class Methanobacteria, family Actinomycetaceae, family Methanobacteriaceae, genus Lachnospiraceae UCG 010, genus Methanobrevibacter, order Actinomycetales, and order Methanobacteriales predicted a higher risk of CC, and a higher abundance of family Streptococcaceae, genus Dialister, and phylum Bacteroidetes predicted a lower risk of CC, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Our study implied a mutual causality between GM and CC, which provided a novel concept for the occurrence and development of CC, and might promote future functional or clinical analysis."
38418892,Natural Killer Cell Infiltration in Prostate Cancers Predict Improved Patient Outcomes.,"BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells are non-antigen specific innate immune cells that can be redirected to targets of interest using multiple strategies, although none are currently FDA-approved. We sought to evaluate NK cell infiltration into tumors to develop an improved understanding of which histologies may be most amenable to NK cell-based therapies currently in the developmental pipeline. METHODS: DNA (targeted/whole-exome) and RNA (whole-transcriptome) sequencing was performed from tumors from 45 cancer types (N = 90,916 for all cancers and N = 3365 for prostate cancer) submitted to Caris Life Sciences. NK cell fractions and immune deconvolution were inferred from RNA-seq data using quanTIseq. Real-world overall survival (OS) and treatment status was determined and Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated. Statistical significance was determined using X(2) and Mann-Whitney U tests, with corrections for multiple comparisons where appropriate. RESULTS: In both a pan-tumor and prostate cancer (PCa) -specific setting, we demonstrated that NK cells represent a substantial proportion of the total cellular infiltrate (median range 2-9% for all tumors). Higher NK cell infiltration was associated with improved OS in 28 of 45 cancer types, including (PCa). NK cell infiltration was negatively correlated with common driver mutations and androgen receptor variants (AR-V7) in primary prostate biopsies, while positively correlated with negative immune regulators. Higher levels of NK cell infiltration were associated with patterns consistent with a compensatory anti-inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: Using the largest available dataset to date, we demonstrated that NK cells infiltrate a broad range of tumors, including both primary and metastatic PCa. NK cell infiltration is associated with improved PCa patient outcomes. This study demonstrates that NK cells are capable of trafficking to both primary and metastatic PCa and are a viable option for immunotherapy approaches moving forward. Future development of strategies to enhance tumor-infiltrating NK cell-mediated cytolytic activity and activation while limiting inhibitory pathways will be key."
38418825,Prediction of plasma ctDNA fraction and prognostic implications of liquid biopsy in advanced prostate cancer.,"No consensus strategies exist for prognosticating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Circulating tumor DNA fraction (ctDNA%) is increasingly reported by commercial and laboratory tests but its utility for risk stratification is unclear. Here, we intersect ctDNA%, treatment outcomes, and clinical characteristics across 738 plasma samples from 491 male mCRPC patients from two randomized multicentre phase II trials and a prospective province-wide blood biobanking program. ctDNA% correlates with serum and radiographic metrics of disease burden and is highest in patients with liver metastases. ctDNA% strongly predicts overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment response independent of therapeutic context and outperformed established prognostic clinical factors. Recognizing that ctDNA-based biomarker genotyping is limited by low ctDNA% in some patients, we leverage the relationship between clinical prognostic factors and ctDNA% to develop a clinically-interpretable machine-learning tool that predicts whether a patient has sufficient ctDNA% for informative ctDNA genotyping (available online: https://www.ctDNA.org ). Our results affirm ctDNA% as an actionable tool for patient risk stratification and provide a practical framework for optimized biomarker testing."
38418456,Structure of the p53 degradation complex from HPV16.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a significant contributor to the global cancer burden, and its carcinogenic activity is facilitated in part by the HPV early protein 6 (E6), which interacts with the E3-ligase E6AP, also known as UBE3A, to promote degradation of the tumor suppressor, p53. In this study, we present a single-particle cryoEM structure of the full-length E6AP protein in complex with HPV16 E6 (16E6) and p53, determined at a resolution of ~3.3 A. Our structure reveals extensive protein-protein interactions between 16E6 and E6AP, explaining their picomolar binding affinity. These findings shed light on the molecular basis of the ternary complex, which has been pursued as a potential therapeutic target for HPV-driven cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers over the last two decades. Understanding the structural and mechanistic underpinnings of this complex is crucial for developing effective therapies to combat HPV-induced cancers. Our findings may help to explain why previous attempts to disrupt this complex have failed to generate therapeutic modalities and suggest that current strategies should be reevaluated."
38417537,LCP1-mediated cytoskeleton alterations involve in arsenite-triggered malignant phenotype of human immortalized prostate stromal cells.,"The connection between continuous arsenic exposure and prostate cancer is already established. However, the exact mechanisms of arsenic tumorigenesis are far from clear. Here, we employed human prostate stromal immortalized cells (WPMY-1) continuous exposure to 1 and 2 muM arsenite for 29 weeks to identify the malignant phenotype and explore the underlying molecular mechanism. As expected, continuous low-dose arsenite exposure led to the malignant phenotype of WPMY-1 cells. Quantitative proteomics identified 517 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), of which the most remarkably changed proteins (such as LCP1 and DDX58, etc.) and the bioinformatic analysis were focused on the regulation of cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and migration. Further, cell experiments showed that continuous arsenite exposure altered cytoskeleton structure, enhanced cell adhesive capability, and raised the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATM, p-ATM, p-ERK1/2, and LCP1 proteins. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment antagonized the increase of LCP1 proteins, and LCP1 knockdown partially restored F-actin organization caused by arsenic. Overall, the results demonstrated that ROS-ATM-ERK1/2 signaling pathway was involved in the activation of LCP1, leading to cytoskeleton alterations. These alterations are believed to play a significant role in arsenite-triggered tumor microenvironment cell-acquired malignant phenotype, which could provide potential biomarkers with therapeutic implications for prostate cancer."
38416196,Exploring the therapeutic potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in cancer treatment: integrating in silico and in vitro investigations.,"The present study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer mechanism of canagliflozin (CANA) and dapagliflozin (DAPA), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, using in silico and in vitro approaches. Network pharmacology was employed to predict the targets of the inhibitors and GO gene enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation conducted to explore the interacting pathways. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies were performed to confirm the important targets and assess conformational stability. In vitro cytotoxicity assays, MIA-PaCa-2 and DU-145 cell lines CANA and DAPA was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis indicated that CANA and DAPA exert anticancer effects through MAPK, mTOR, EGFR-KRAS-BRAF, FGFR, and PI3KA pathways. KEGG analysis revealed that these inhibitors could be used in the treatment of various cancers, including breast, prostate, pancreatic, chronic myeloid leukemia, thyroid, small cell lung, gastric, and bladder cancer. Docking results showed highest affinity for MAPK1 for CANA (- 9.60 kcal/mol) and DAPA (- 9.58 kcal/mol). MD simulation results showed that RMSD values for the MAPK1-compound exhibit remarkable stability over a timeframe of 100 ns. In cytotoxicity assays using MIA-PaCa-2 and DU-145 cell lines, CANA demonstrated a potential antiproliferative effect on the pancreatic cell line MIA-PaCa-2 after 48 h of treatment at a concentration of 100 microg/ml. Furthermore, CANA arrested the cell cycle in the sub-G1 phase and induced late apoptosis and necrosis in MIA-PaCa-2 cell line. Based on these findings, CANA shows promise as a potential novel treatment strategy for pancreatic cancer."
38415270,ATM Variant as a Cause of Hereditary Cutaneous Melanoma in a Spanish Family: Case Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) is a cancer predisposition gene; carriers of germline pathogenic variants have an increased risk of developing malignancies, including breast, prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. Most ATM variants are of uncertain significance. Findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that ATM may be a low-risk melanoma susceptibility locus. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a Hispanic family whose members who have presented cutaneous melanoma have been found to be carriers for the ATM pathogenic variant c.3747-1G>C (rs730881364), one of whom was diagnosed at 24 years old. DISCUSSION: We describe for the first time the possible clinical association between ATM (c.3747-1G>C) and familial melanoma. In silico splice site analysis predicts that this alteration will weaken the native splice acceptor site and will result in the creation or strengthening of a novel splice acceptor site, assuming a variant that entails loss of functionality that is probably pathogenic and related to oncogenesis. However, we cannot exclude that cutaneous melanoma in both members and at an early age is the result of chance, environmental interaction, other uncontrolled external factors, or the interaction of other genetic alterations other than the ATM variant described in this study."
38415240,Detection of PSMA expression on circulating tumor cells by blood-based liquid biopsy in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: For patients with mCRPC, PSMA-targeted radioligand treatment has significantly improved the clinical outcome. A blood-based liquid biopsy assay for recognizing PSMA protein expression on circulating tumor cells may be beneficial for better informing therapeutic decision-making and identifying the patients most likely to benefit from PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy. METHODS: Using high-throughput imaging and digital AI pathology algorithms, a four-color immunofluorescence assay has been developed to find PSMA protein expression on CTCs on a glass slide. Cell line cells (LNCaP/PC3s/22Rv1) spiked into healthy donor blood were used to study the precision, specificity, sensitivity, limit of detection, and overall accuracy of the assay. Clinical validation and low-pass whole-genome sequencing were performed in PSMA-PET-positive patients with high-risk mCRPC (N = 24) utilizing 3 mL of blood. RESULTS: The PSMA CTC IF assay achieved analytical specificity, sensitivity, and overall accuracy above 99% with high precision. In the clinical validation, 76% (16/21) of the cases were PSMA positive with CTC heterogeneity, and 88% (21/24) of the patients contained at least one conventional CTC per milliliter of blood. Thirty-six low-pass-sequenced CTCs from 11 individuals with mCRPC frequently exhibited copy number increases in AR and MYC and losses in RB1, PTEN, TP53, and BRCA2 locus. CONCLUSIONS: The analytical validation utilizing Epic Sciences' liquid biopsy CTC platform demonstrated the potential to detect PSMA protein expression in CTCs from patients with mCRPC. This assay is positioned as an effective research tool to evaluate PSMA expression, heterogeneity, and therapeutic response in many ongoing clinical studies to target tumors that express PSMA."
38414861,PBRM1 presents a potential ctDNA marker to monitor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a therapeutic option for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) patients. This study was aimed to identify potential liquid biopsy biomarkers to monitor the NACT response. Through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor tissue DNA (ttDNA) taken from LACC patients undergoing platinum-based NACT, 64 genes with mutations emerge during NACT in the non-responders but none in the responders. Among them, the PBRM1, SETD2, and ROS1 mutations were frequently detected in the ctDNA and ttDNA of the non-responders, and mutant PBRM1 was associated with poorer survival of patients. In vitro, PBRM1 knockdown promoted resistance to cisplatin through boosting STAT3 signaling in cervical cancer cells, while it sensitized tumor cells to poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase inhibitor olaparib. These findings suggest that mutant PBRM1 is a potential ctDNA marker of emerging resistance to NACT and of increased sensitivity to olaparib, which warrants further clinical validation."
38413979,Splicing targeting drugs highlight intron retention as an actionable vulnerability in advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Advanced prostate cancer (PC) is characterized by insensitivity to androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy, resulting in poor outcome for most patients. Thus, advanced PC urgently needs novel therapeutic strategies. Mounting evidence points to splicing dysregulation as a hallmark of advanced PC. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of the splicing process is emerging as a promising option for this disease. METHOD: By using a representative androgen-insensitive PC cell line (22Rv1), we have investigated the genome-wide transcriptomic effects underlying the cytotoxic effects exerted by three splicing-targeting drugs: Pladienolide B, indisulam and THZ531. Bioinformatic analyses were performed to uncover the gene structural features underlying sensitivity to transcriptional and splicing regulation by these treatments. Biological pathways altered by these treatments were annotated by gene ontology analyses and validated by functional experiments in cell models. RESULTS: Although eliciting similar cytotoxic effects on advanced PC cells, Pladienolide B, indisulam and THZ531 modulate specific transcriptional and splicing signatures. Drug sensitivity is associated with distinct gene structural features, expression levels and cis-acting sequence elements in the regulated exons and introns. Importantly, we identified PC-relevant genes (i.e. EZH2, MDM4) whose drug-induced splicing alteration exerts an impact on cell survival. Moreover, computational analyses uncovered a widespread impact of splicing-targeting drugs on intron retention, with enrichment in genes implicated in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (i.e. CSTF3, PCF11). Coherently, advanced PC cells displayed high sensitivity to a specific inhibitor of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex, which enhances the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs that are already in use for this cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers intron retention as an actionable vulnerability for advanced PC, which may be exploited to improve therapeutic management of this currently incurable disease."
38413763,Genomic attributes of prostate cancer across primary and metastatic noncastrate and castrate resistant disease states: a next generation sequencing study of 183 patients.,"Primary prostatic adenocarcinoma (pPC) undergoes genomic evolution secondary to therapy-related selection pressures as it transitions to metastatic noncastrate (mNC-PC) and castrate resistant (mCR-PC) disease. Next generation sequencing results were evaluated for pPC (n = 97), locally advanced disease (involving urinary bladder/rectum, n = 12), mNC-PC (n = 21), and mCR-PC (n = 54). We identified enrichment of TP53 alterations in high-grade pPC, TP53/RB1 alterations in HGNE disease, and AR alterations in metastatic and castrate resistant disease. Actionable alterations (MSI-H phenotype and HRR genes) were identified in approximately a fifth of all cases. These results help elucidate the landscape of genomic alterations across the clinical spectrum of prostate cancer."
38412481,Thio-2 Inhibits Key Signaling Pathways Required for the Development and Progression of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Therapies that abrogate persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remain an unmet clinical need. The N-terminal domain of the AR that drives transcriptional activity in CRPC remains a challenging therapeutic target. Herein we demonstrate that BCL-2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1) mRNA is highly expressed and associates with signaling pathways, including AR signaling, that are implicated in the development and progression of CRPC. In addition, interrogation of geometric and physiochemical properties of the BAG domain of BAG-1 isoforms identifies it to be a tractable but challenging drug target. Furthermore, through BAG-1 isoform mouse knockout studies, we confirm that BAG-1 isoforms regulate hormone physiology and that therapies targeting the BAG domain will be associated with limited ""on-target"" toxicity. Importantly, the postulated inhibitor of BAG-1 isoforms, Thio-2, suppressed AR signaling and other important pathways implicated in the development and progression of CRPC to reduce the growth of treatment-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived models. However, the mechanism by which Thio-2 elicits the observed phenotype needs further elucidation as the genomic abrogation of BAG-1 isoforms was unable to recapitulate the Thio-2-mediated phenotype. Overall, these data support the interrogation of related compounds with improved drug-like properties as a novel therapeutic approach in CRPC, and further highlight the clinical potential of treatments that block persistent AR signaling which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in CRPC."
38412389,Incorporating Genetic Risk Into Prostate Cancer Care: Implications for Early Detection and Precision Oncology.,"The availability and cost of germline and somatic genetic testing have dramatically improved over the past two decades, enabling precision medicine approaches in oncology, with significant implications for prostate cancer (PCa) care. Roughly 12% of individuals with advanced disease are carriers of rare pathogenic germline variants that predispose to particularly aggressive and earlier-onset disease. Several of these variants are already established as clinically actionable by modern precision oncology therapeutics, while others may come to aid the selection of active surveillance, definitive local therapies, and systemic therapies. Concurrently, the number of common variants (ie, incorporated into polygenic risk scores) associated with PCa risk has continued to grow, but with several important considerations both at the intersection of race and ancestry and for early detection of aggressive disease. Family history has historically been used as a proxy for this inherited genetic risk of PCa, but recently emerging evidence examining this relation has shifted our understanding of how best to leverage this tool in PCa care. This review seeks to clarify and contextualize the existing and emerging precision oncology paradigms that use inherited genetic risk in PCa care, for both early detection and localized disease management."
38410974,Genetic variant in a BaP-activated super-enhancer increases prostate cancer risk by promoting AhR-mediated FAM227A expression.,"Genetic variants in super-enhancers (SEs) are increasingly implicated as a disease risk-driving mechanism. Previous studies have reported an associations between benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) exposure and some malignant tumor risk. Currently, it is unclear whether BaP is involved in the effect of genetic variants in SEs on prostate cancer risk, nor the associated intrinsic molecular mechanisms. In the current study, by using logistic regression analysis, we found that rs5750581T>C in 22q-SE was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.26, P = 7.61 x 10 (-5)). We also have found that the rs6001092T>G, in a high linkage disequilibrium with rs5750581T>C ( r (2) = 0.98), is located in a regulatory aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) motif and may interact with the FAM227A promoter in further bioinformatics analysis. We then performed a series of functional and BaP acute exposure experiments to assess biological function of the genetic variant and the target gene. Biologically, the rs6001092-G allele strengthened the transcription factor binding affinity to AhR, thereby upregulating FAM227A, especially upon exposure to BaP, which induced the malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer. The current study highlights that AhR acts as an environmental sensor of BaP and is involved in the SE-mediated prostate cancer risk, which may provide new insights into the etiology of prostate cancer associated with the inherited SE variants under environmental carcinogen stressors."
38409850,Genomic analysis of primary epithelial neoplasms of the seminal vesicle identifies a subset of mucinous cystic tumours driven by KRAS mutations.,"BACKGROUND: Carcinomas of the seminal vesicle are exceedingly rare, with a limited number of cases described in the literature. Reported cases span a relatively wide morphological spectrum, and their genomic features remain unexplored. DESIGN: In this study, we interrogated five primary epithelial neoplasms of the seminal vesicle using a targeted DNA sequencing platform (OncoPanel, 447 genes). RESULTS: The tumours included one adenocarcinoma with intestinal phenotype presenting after external beam radiation (for prostatic adenocarcinoma), one carcinoma with Mullerian-type clear cell phenotype, two mucinous tumours resembling low-grade mucinous neoplasms of the appendix (LAMN) and one mucinous cystadenoma. The post-radiation mucinous adenocarcinoma had genomic findings consistent with bi-allelic inactivation of TP53, as well as multiple copy-number changes with regional and chromosomal arm-level copy-number losses. The Mullerian-type clear cell carcinoma exhibited a complex copy-number profile with numerous regional and arm-level copy-number changes, as well as focal amplification events, including copy-number gain of 8q and amplification of a region within 20q13. Both low-grade mucinous tumours resembling LAMN harboured hot-spot gain-of-function KRAS variants (p.G12V and p.G13D) as the only genomic alteration. No genomic alterations were detected inthe lesion diagnosed as mucinous cystadenoma. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that primary low-grade mucinous neoplasms of the seminal vesicle may represent a distinct entity equivalent to appendiceal counterparts, driven by gain-of-function variants of RAS GTPases. The remaining tumours showed genomic features that closely resembled those of neoplasms with comparable phenotypes and/or biological characteristics arising in other sites, suggesting that they could be managed similarly, with special considerations related to their anatomical location."
38409079,scCircle-seq unveils the diversity and complexity of extrachromosomal circular DNAs in single cells.,"Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) have emerged as important intra-cellular mobile genetic elements that affect gene copy number and exert in trans regulatory roles within the cell nucleus. Here, we describe scCircle-seq, a method for profiling eccDNAs and unraveling their diversity and complexity in single cells. We implement and validate scCircle-seq in normal and cancer cell lines, demonstrating that most eccDNAs vary largely between cells and are stochastically inherited during cell division, although their genomic landscape is cell type-specific and can be used to accurately cluster cells of the same origin. eccDNAs are preferentially produced from chromatin regions enriched in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone marks and are induced during replication stress conditions. Concomitant sequencing of eccDNAs and RNA from the same cell uncovers the absence of correlation between eccDNA copy number and gene expression levels, except for a few oncogenes, including MYC, contained within a large eccDNA in colorectal cancer cells. Lastly, we apply scCircle-seq to one prostate cancer and two breast cancer specimens, revealing cancer-specific eccDNA landscapes and a higher propensity of eccDNAs to form in amplified genomic regions. scCircle-seq is a scalable tool that can be used to dissect the complexity of eccDNAs across different cell and tissue types, and further expands the potential of eccDNAs for cancer diagnostics."
38407348,Knockdown of FAM83A to Verify Its Role in Cervical Cancer Cell Growth and Cisplatin Sensitivity.,"The exploration of tumor target genes holds paramount importance for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer. In this study, we outline the steps involved in the identification of a tumor target gene FAM83A in cervical cancer. First, the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was employed to validate the expression and prognostic significance of FAM83A in women. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used for knockdown of the FAM83A gene in HeLa and C33a cells. Next, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining was conducted to determine the effects on the proliferation capabilities of the tumor cells. Wound healing and porous membrane insert assays were performed to evaluate tumor cell migration and invasion abilities. Western blotting was used to quantify apoptosis-related protein levels. JC-1 staining was employed to evaluate mitochondrial function alterations. Furthermore, cisplatin (diaminedichloroplatinum, DDP) intervention was used to assess the therapeutic potential of the target gene. Flow cytometry and colony formation assays were conducted to further validate the anticancer characteristics of the gene. As a result, FAM83A knockdown was shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells and sensitize these cells to cisplatin. These comprehensive methodologies collectively validate FAM83A as a tumor-associated target gene, holding promise as a potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer."
38406143,A Genome-Wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Using Occupational and Environmental Factors as Confounding Factors.,"Background In addition to genetic predisposition, occupational and environmental factors are important for the risk of prostate cancer. We investigated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the development of prostate cancer in Japan, including occupational and industrial history as confounding factors in addition to age, smoking, and alcohol drinking. Methods We enrolled 210 prostate cancer patients and 504 male control patients. We conducted four genome-wide association study (GWAS) patterns for prostate cancer development. In the association test, logistic regression models incorporated age, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, and each pattern of industrial/occupational classification. Results No SNPs satisfying the genome-wide significance level of 5x10(-8) were detected in GWAS. SNPs with a suggestive association level of 1x10(-6) were found near the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1824 (LINC01824) and tripartite motif family like 2 (TRIML2) genes in the GWAS using occupational history as a confounder and near the ribosomal protein S2 pseudogene 25 (RPS2P25) gene in the GWAS using industrial history as a confounder. No SNPs that met the suggestive association level were observed in the GWAS that did not include occupational and industrial history. Conclusion By adding occupational and industrial history to the confounding factors, there were SNPs detected in the GWAS for prostate cancer development. The consideration of occupational and industrial history may increase the usefulness of GWAS."
38405914,Processing-bias correction with DEBIAS-M improves cross-study generalization of microbiome-based prediction models.,"Every step in common microbiome profiling protocols has variable efficiency for each microbe. For example, different DNA extraction kits may have different efficiency for Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These variable efficiencies, combined with technical variation, create strong processing biases, which impede the identification of signals that are reproducible across studies and the development of generalizable and biologically interpretable prediction models. ""Batch-correction"" methods have been used to alleviate these issues computationally with some success. However, many make strong parametric assumptions which do not necessarily apply to microbiome data or processing biases, or require the use of an outcome variable, which risks overfitting. Lastly and importantly, existing transformations used to correct microbiome data are largely non-interpretable, and could, for example, introduce values to features that were initially mostly zeros. Altogether, processing bias currently compromises our ability to glean robust and generalizable biological insights from microbiome data. Here, we present DEBIAS-M (Domain adaptation with phenotype Estimation and Batch Integration Across Studies of the Microbiome), an interpretable framework for inference and correction of processing bias, which facilitates domain adaptation in microbiome studies. DEBIAS-M learns bias-correction factors for each microbe in each batch that simultaneously minimize batch effects and maximize cross-study associations with phenotypes. Using benchmarks of HIV and colorectal cancer classification from gut microbiome data, and cervical neoplasia prediction from cervical microbiome data, we demonstrate that DEBIAS-M outperforms batch-correction methods commonly used in the field. Notably, we show that the inferred bias-correction factors are stable, interpretable, and strongly associated with specific experimental protocols. Overall, we show that DEBIAS-M allows for better modeling of microbiome data and identification of interpretable signals that are reproducible across studies."
38404590,Exploring genetic associations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with extraintestinal cancers in European and East Asian populations.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported associations of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with the risks of extraintestinal cancers, but the causality remains unclear. METHODS: Using genetic variations robustly associated with CD and UC extracted from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as instrumental variables. Nine types of extraintestinal cancers of European and Asian populations were selected as outcomes. We used the inverse variance weighted method as the primary approach for two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the reliability of our findings. RESULTS: In the European population, we found that CD showed a potential causal relationship with pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.1042; 95% CI: 1.0087-1.2088; P=0.0318). Meanwhile, both CD (outliers excluded: OR: 1.0208; 95% CI: 1.0079-1.0339; P=0.0015) and UC (outliers excluded: OR: 1.0220; 95% CI: 1.0051-1.0393; P=0.0108) were associated with a slight increase in breast cancer risk. Additionally, UC exhibited a potential causal effect on cervical cancer (outliers excluded: OR: 1.1091; 95% CI: 1.0286-1.1960; P=0.0071). In the East Asian population, CD had significant causal effects on pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.1876; 95% CI: 1.0741-1.3132; P=0.0008) and breast cancer (outliers excluded: OR: 0.9452; 95% CI: 0.9096-0.9822; P=0.0040). For UC, it exhibited significant causal associations with gastric cancer (OR: 1.1240; 95% CI: 1.0624-1.1891; P=4.7359x10(-5)), bile duct cancer (OR: 1.3107; 95% CI: 1.0983-1.5641; P=0.0027), hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.2365; 95% CI: 1.1235-1.3608; P=1.4007x10(-5)) and cervical cancer (OR: 1.3941; 95% CI: 1.1708-1.6599; P=0.0002), as well as a potential causal effect on lung cancer (outliers excluded: OR: 1.1313; 95% CI: 1.0280-1.2449; P=0.0116). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided evidence that genetically predicted CD may be a risk factor for pancreatic and breast cancers in the European population, and for pancreatic cancer in the East Asian population. Regarding UC, it may be a risk factor for cervical and breast cancers in Europeans, and for gastric, bile duct, hepatocellular, lung, and cervical cancers in East Asians. Therefore, patients with CD and UC need to emphasize screening and prevention of site-specific extraintestinal cancers."
38404489,In-Depth Glycoproteomic Assay of Urinary Prostatic Acid Phosphatase.,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a well-known clinical biomarker in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, but a better test is still needed, as the serum-level-based PSA quantification exhibits limited specificity and comes with poor predictive value. Prior to PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was used, but it was replaced by PSA because PSA improved the early detection of PCa. Upon revisiting PAP and its glycosylation specifically, it appears to be a promising new biomarker candidate. Namely, previous studies have indicated that PAP glycoforms differ between PCa and non-PCa individuals. However, an in-depth characterization of PAP glycosylation is still lacking. In this study, we established an in-depth glycoproteomic assay for urinary PAP by characterizing both the micro- and macroheterogeneity of the PAP glycoprofile. For this purpose, PAP samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry after affinity purification from urine and proteolytic digestion. The developed urinary PAP assay was applied on a pooled DRE (digital rectal examination) urine sample from nine individuals. Three glycosylation sites were characterized, namely N(94), N(220), and N(333), via N-glycopeptide analysis. Taking sialic acid linkage isomers into account, a total of 63, 27, and 4 N-glycan structures were identified, respectively. The presented PAP glycoproteomic assay will enable the determination of potential glycomic biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of PCa in cohort studies."
38401997,Atypical glandular cells in Pap tests: cytology-histology correlation and risk assessment with human papillopmavirus (HPV) testing.,"INTRODUCTION: Atypical glandular cells (AGC) represent less than 1% of Pap test cases and include a variety of lesions in both the cervix and endometrium. The study aimed to investigate the cytology-histology correlation in AGC patients and to evaluate the clinical utility of hrHPV testing in this diagnostic context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 491 atypical glandular cells (AGC) cases in our quality analysis (QA) database of 336,064 Pap tests interpreted between March 1, 2013 and July 12, 2016. Of these, 251 cases had follow-up biopsies with hrHPV tests in 148 cases. RESULTS: The most common histologic diagnosis associated with AGC was normal/benign or low-grade lesions, comprising 55% of cervical biopsies and 24% of endometrial biopsies. High-grade lesions were identified in 21% of follow-up biopsies. In patients with AGC cytology, a positive hrHPV test significantly increased the likelihood of cervical HSIL or above lesions on biopsy by 26.4 times (OR = 26.4, 95% CI: 5.8-119.4, P < 0.0001). A positive genotyping result for HPV 16 dramatically increased the likelihood of cervical HSIL or above lesions on biopsy (OR = 84, 95% CI: 12.0-590.5, P < 0.0001). The HPV test had a negative predictive value of 97% (CI: 85%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that AGC is a significant diagnosis with an overall risk for high-grade cervical or endometrial lesions as high as 21%. hrHPV testing with genotyping is an effective tool for identifying high-risk individuals within the AGC population, with excellent positive and negative predictive values. This approach is valuable for clinical risk stratification and differential diagnosis in patients with AGC cytology."
38401369,Human papillomavirus negative high grade cervical lesions and cancers: Suggested guidance for HPV testing quality assurance.,"BACKGROUND: Some high-grade cervical lesions and cervical cancers (HSIL+) test negative for human papillomavirus (HPV). The HPV-negative fraction varies between 0.03 % and 15 % between different laboratories. Monitoring and extended re-analysis of HPV-negative HSIL+ could thus be helpful to monitor performance of HPV testing services. We aimed to a) provide a real-life example of a quality assurance (QA) program based on re-analysis of HPV-negative HSIL+ and b) develop international guidance for QA of HPV testing services based on standardized identification of apparently HPV-negative HSIL+ and extended re-analysis, either by the primary laboratory or by a national HPV reference laboratory (NRL). METHODS: There were 116 initially HPV-negative cervical specimens (31 histopathology specimens and 85 liquid-based cytology samples) sent to the Swedish HPV Reference Laboratory for re-testing. Based on the results, an international QA guidance was developed through an iterative consensus process. RESULT: Standard PCR testing detected HPV in 55.2 % (64/116) of initially ""HPV-negative"" samples. Whole genome sequencing of PCR-negative samples identified HPV in an additional 7 samples (overall 61.2 % HPV positivity). Reasons for failure to detect HPV in an HSIL+ lesion are listed and guidance to identify cases for extended re-testing, including which information should be included when referring samples to an NRL are presented. CONCLUSION: Monitoring the proportion of and reasons for failure to detect HPV in HSIL+ will help support high performance and quality improvement of HPV testing services. We encourage implementation of QA strategies based on re-analysis of ""HPV negative"" HSIL+ samples."
38401083,Acidic Leucine-Rich Nuclear Protein Phosphatase 32B Promotes Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cell Progression by Regulating Apoptosis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.,"OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the expression of acidic leucine-rich nuclear protein phosphatase 32B (ANP32B) in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and evaluate the effect of ANP32B on the proliferation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells. METHODS: We evaluated the expression of ANP32B in PRAD tissues and cells compared to the controls obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). siRNA targeting ANP32B was transfected into DU145 cells to knockdown the ANP32B expression and plasmids carrying ANP32B coding region were used to overexpress ANP32B in PC3 cells. We analyze the knockdown or overexpression efficiency of ANP32B with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. CCK-8 assay, cell colony formation assay, transwell assay, and EdU labeling were performed to investigate the function of ANP32B on the progression of PRAD. Finally, the expression of the cell cycle marker, apoptosis marker, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: ANP32B expression was upregulated in PRAD samples compared to normal samples. Exogenous ANP32B overexpression promoted cell viability, cell colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation, and cell migration. Inhibition of ANP32B suppressed cell proliferation, growth, and migration. At the molecular level, the genes promoting cell growth and migration, including cyclin D1 and N-cadherin, were significantly upregulated after ANP32B overexpression, whereas those inhibiting cell growth and migration such as cleaved caspase 3 and E-cadherin were downregulated. CONCLUSION: The tumor-promoting function of ANP32B can be attributed to its capacity to facilitate cell progression, and it may be considered as a therapeutic marker for PRAD therapy."
38400671,Phase I study of sapanisertib (CB-228/TAK-228/MLN0128) in combination with ziv-aflibercept in patients with advanced solid tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Sapanisertib is a potent ATP-competitive, dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2. Ziv-aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein comprising human VEGF receptor extracellular domains fused to human immunoglobulin G1. HIF-1alpha inhibition in combination with anti-angiogenic therapy is a promising anti-tumor strategy. This Phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study assessed safety/ tolerability of sapanisertib in combination with ziv-aflibercept in advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with heavily pre-treated advanced metastatic solid tumors resistant or refractory to standard treatment received treatment on a range of dose levels. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled and treated across a range of dose levels. Forty were female (73%), median age was 62 (range: 21-79), and ECOG PS was 0 (9, 16%) or 1 (46, 84%). Most common tumor types included ovarian (8), colorectal (8), sarcoma (8), breast (3), cervical (4), and endometrial (4). Median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range 2-11). Sapanisertib 4 mg orally 3 days on and 4 days off plus 3 mg/kg ziv-aflibercept IV every 2 weeks on a 28-day cycle was defined as the maximum tolerated dose. Most frequent treatment-related grade >/=2 adverse events included hypertension, fatigue, anorexia, hypertriglyceridemia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis, and serum lipase increase. There were no grade 5 events. In patients with evaluable disease (n = 50), 37 patients (74%) achieved stable disease (SD) as best response, two patients (4%) achieved a confirmed partial response (PR); disease control rate (DCR) (CR + SD + PR) was 78%. CONCLUSION: The combination of sapanisertib and ziv-aflibercept was generally tolerable and demonstrated anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced malignancies."
38400534,Regulation and tumor-suppressive function of the miR-379/miR-656 (C14MC) cluster in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a key contributor to cancer-related mortality in several countries. The identification of molecular markers and the underlying mechanism may help improve CC management. We studied the regulation and biological function of the chromosome 14 microRNA cluster (C14MC; miR-379/miR-656) in CC. Most C14MC members exhibited considerably lower expression in CC tissues and cell lines in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma patient cohorts. Bisulfite Sanger sequencing revealed hypermethylation of the C14MC promoter in CC tissues and cell lines. 5-aza-2 deoxy cytidine treatment reactivated expression of the C14MC members. We demonstrated that C14MC is a methylation-regulated miRNA cluster via artificial methylation and luciferase reporter assays. C14MC downregulation correlated with poor overall survival and may promote metastasis. C14MC activation via the lentiviral-based CRISPRa approach inhibited growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion; enhanced G2/M arrest; and induced senescence. Post-transcriptional regulatory network analysis of C14MC transcriptomic data revealed enrichment of key cancer-related pathways, such as metabolism, the cell cycle, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling. Reduced cell proliferation, growth, migration, invasion, and senescence correlated with the downregulation of active AKT, MYC, and cyclin E1 (CCNE1) and the overexpression of p16, p21, and p27. We showed that C14MC miRNA activation increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and lipid peroxidation rates, and inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). C14MC targets pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3) according to the luciferase reporter assay. PDK3 is overexpressed in CC and is inversely correlated with C14MC. Both miR-494-mimic transfection and C14MC activation inhibited PDK3 expression. Reduced glucose uptake and lactate production, and upregulation of PDK3 upon C14MC activation suggest the potential role of these proteins in metabolic reprogramming. Finally, we showed that C14MC activation may inhibit EMT signaling. Thus, C14MC is a tumor-suppressive and methylation-regulated miRNA cluster in CC. Reactivation of C14MC can be useful in the management of CC."
38399969,"HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase Expression in HPV16-Infected Epidermoid Carcinoma Cells Alters E6 Expression and Cellular Metabolism, and Induces a Hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal Cell Phenotype.","The high incidence of epithelial malignancies in HIV-1 infected individuals is associated with co-infection with oncogenic viruses, such as high-risk human papillomaviruses (HR HPVs), mostly HPV16. The molecular mechanisms underlying the HIV-1-associated increase in epithelial malignancies are not fully understood. A collaboration between HIV-1 and HR HPVs in the malignant transformation of epithelial cells has long been anticipated. Here, we delineated the effects of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase on the in vitro and in vivo properties of HPV16-infected cervical cancer cells. A human cervical carcinoma cell line infected with HPV16 (Ca Ski) was made to express HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by lentiviral transduction. The levels of the mRNA of the E6 isoforms and of the factors characteristic to the epithelial/mesenchymal transition were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. The parameters of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration were determined using Seahorse technology. RT expressing Ca Ski subclones were assessed for the capacity to form tumors in nude mice. RT expression increased the expression of the E6*I isoform, modulated the expression of E-CADHERIN and VIMENTIN, indicating the presence of a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype, enhanced glycolysis, and inhibited mitochondrial respiration. In addition, the expression of RT induced phenotypic alterations impacting cell motility, clonogenic activity, and the capacity of Ca Ski cells to form tumors in nude mice. These findings suggest that HIV-RT, a multifunctional protein, affects HPV16-induced oncogenesis, which is achieved through modulation of the expression of the E6 oncoprotein. These results highlight a complex interplay between HIV antigens and HPV oncoproteins potentiating the malignant transformation of epithelial cells."
38398706,PARP Inhibitors in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Unraveling the Therapeutic Landscape.,"The treatment landscape of metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) is rapidly evolving with the recent approvals of poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Already part of the therapeutic armamentarium in different types of advanced cancers, these molecules have shaped a new era in mPCa by targeting genomic pathways altered in these patients, leading to promising responses. These agents act by inhibiting poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes involved in repairing single-strand breaks in the DNA. Based on the PROfound and TRITON3 trials, olaparib and rucaparib were respectively approved as monotherapy in pretreated patients with mCRPC and alterations in prespecified genes. The combinations of olaparib with abiraterone (PROpel) and niraparib with abiraterone (MAGNITUDE) were approved as first-line options in patients with mCRPC and alterations in BRCA1/2, whereas the combination of talazoparib with enzalutamide (TALAPRO-2) was approved in the same setting in patients with alterations in any of the HRR genes, which are found in around a quarter of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Additional trials are already underway to assess these agents in an earlier hormone-sensitive setting. Future directions will include refining the treatment sequencing in patients with mCRPC in the clinic while taking into account the financial toxicity as well as the potential side effects encountered with these therapies and elucidating their mechanism of action in patients with non-altered HRR genes. Herein, we review the biological rationale behind using PARPis in mCRPC and the key aforementioned clinical trials that paved the way for these approvals."
38397134,DARDN: A Deep-Learning Approach for CTCF Binding Sequence Classification and Oncogenic Regulatory Feature Discovery.,"Characterization of gene regulatory mechanisms in cancer is a key task in cancer genomics. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a DNA binding protein, exhibits specific binding patterns in the genome of cancer cells and has a non-canonical function to facilitate oncogenic transcription programs by cooperating with transcription factors bound at flanking distal regions. Identification of DNA sequence features from a broad genomic region that distinguish cancer-specific CTCF binding sites from regular CTCF binding sites can help find oncogenic transcription factors in a cancer type. However, the presence of long DNA sequences without localization information makes it difficult to perform conventional motif analysis. Here, we present DNAResDualNet (DARDN), a computational method that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting cancer-specific CTCF binding sites from long DNA sequences and employs DeepLIFT, a method for interpretability of deep learning models that explains the model's output in terms of the contributions of its input features. The method is used for identifying DNA sequence features associated with cancer-specific CTCF binding. Evaluation on DNA sequences associated with CTCF binding sites in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and other cancer types demonstrates DARDN's ability in classifying DNA sequences surrounding cancer-specific CTCF binding from control constitutive CTCF binding and identifying sequence motifs for transcription factors potentially active in each specific cancer type. We identify potential oncogenic transcription factors in T-ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer (BRCA), colorectal cancer (CRC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and prostate cancer (PRAD). Our work demonstrates the power of advanced machine learning and feature discovery approach in finding biologically meaningful information from complex high-throughput sequencing data."
38396964,"Different Forms of TFF3 in the Human Endocervix, including a Complex with IgG Fc Binding Protein (FCGBP), and Further Aspects of the Cervico-Vaginal Innate Immune Barrier.","TFF3 is a typical secretory poplypeptide of mucous epithelia belonging to the trefoil factor family (TFF) of lectins. In the intestine, respiratory tract, and saliva, TFF3 mainly exists as a high-molecular-mass complex with IgG Fc binding protein (FCGBP), which is indicative of a role in mucosal innate immunity. For the first time, we identified different forms of TFF3 in the endocervix, i.e., monomeric and homodimeric TFF3, as well as a high-molecular-mass TFF3-FCGBP complex; the latter also exists in a hardly soluble form. Immunohistochemistry co-localized TFF3 and FCGBP. Expression analyses of endocervical and post-menopausal vaginal specimens revealed a lack of mucin and TFF3 transcripts in the vaginal specimens. In contrast, genes encoding other typical components of the innate immune defense were expressed in both the endocervix and vagina. Of note, FCGBP is possibly fucosylated. Endocervical specimens from transgender individuals after hormonal therapy showed diminished expression, particularly of FCGBP. Furthermore, mucus swabs from the endocervix and vagina were analyzed concerning TFF3, FCGBP, and lysozyme. It was the aim of this study to illuminate several aspects of the cervico-vaginal innate immune barrier, which is clinically relevant as bacterial and viral infections are also linked to infertility, pre-term birth and cervical cancer."
38396898,Genomic and Immunologic Correlates in Prostate Cancer with High Expression of KLK2.,"The identification of surfaceome proteins is a main goal in cancer research to design antibody-based therapeutic strategies. T cell engagers based on KLK2, a kallikrein specifically expressed in prostate cancer (PRAD), are currently in early clinical development. Using genomic information from different sources, we evaluated the immune microenvironment and genomic profile of prostate tumors with high expression of KLK2. KLK2 was specifically expressed in PRAD but it was not significant associated with Gleason score. Additionally, KLK2 expression did not associate with the presence of any immune cell population and T cell activating markers. A mild correlation between the high expression of KLK2 and the deletion of TMPRSS2 was identified. KLK2 expression associated with high levels of surface proteins linked with a detrimental response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including CHRNA2, FAM174B, OR51E2, TSPAN1, PTPRN2, and the non-surface protein TRPM4. However, no association of these genes with an outcome in PRAD was observed. Finally, the expression of these genes in PRAD did not associate with an outcome in PRAD and any immune populations. We describe the immunologic microenvironment on PRAD tumors with a high expression of KLK2, including a gene signature linked with an inert immune microenvironment, that predicts the response to ICIs in other tumor types. Strategies targeting KLK2 with T cell engagers or antibody-drug conjugates will define whether T cell mobilization or antigen release and stimulation of immune cell death are sufficient effects to induce clinical activity."
38396744,Global Proteomics Analysis of Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling in PC-3 Human Prostate Cancer Cells: Role of CCN1.,"Cysteine-rich angiogenic factor 61 (CCN1/Cyr61) is a matricellular protein that is induced and secreted in response to growth factors. Our previous work showed that 18:1-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which activates the G protein-coupled receptor LPAR1, induces CCN1 between 2-4 h in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells in a manner than enhances cell-substrate adhesion. While the time course of induction suggests that CCN1 contributes to intermediate events in LPA action, the roles of CCN1 in LPA-mediated signal transduction have not been fully elucidated. This study utilized a comprehensive global proteomics approach to identify proteins up- or down-regulated in response to treatment of PC-3 cells with LPA for three hours, during the time of peak CCN1 levels. In addition, the effects of siRNA-mediated CCN1 knockdown on LPA responses were analyzed. The results show that, in addition to CCN1, LPA increased the levels of multiple proteins. Proteins up-regulated by LPA included metastasis-associated in colon cancer protein 1 (MACC1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1/THBS1); both MACC1 and TSP1 regulated cancer cell adhesion and motility. LPA down-regulated thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). CCN1 knockdown suppressed the LPA-induced up-regulation of 30 proteins; these included MACC1 and TSP1, as confirmed by immunoblotting. Gene ontology and STRING analyses revealed multiple pathways impacted by LPA and CCN1. These results indicate that CCN1 contributes to LPA signaling cascades that occur during the intermediate phase after the initial stimulus. The study provides a rationale for the development of interventions to disrupt the LPA-CCN1 axis."
38396008,Single cell-transcriptomic analysis informs the lncRNA landscape in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a lethal form of prostate cancer. Although long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in mCRPC, past studies have relied on bulk sequencing methods with low depth and lack of single-cell resolution. Hence, we performed a lncRNA-focused analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data (n = 14) from mCRPC biopsies followed by integration with bulk multi-omic datasets. This yielded 389 cell-enriched lncRNAs in prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). These lncRNAs demonstrated enrichment with regulatory elements and exhibited alterations during prostate cancer progression. Prostate-lncRNAs were correlated with AR mutational status and response to treatment with enzalutamide, while TME-lncRNAs were associated with RB1 deletions and poor prognosis. Finally, lncRNAs identified between prostate adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors exhibited distinct expression and methylation profiles. Our findings demonstrate the ability of single-cell analysis to refine our understanding of lncRNAs in mCRPC and serve as a resource for future mechanistic studies."
38395379,Identification of a 9-gene signature to enhance biochemical recurrence prediction in primary prostate cancer: A benchmarking study using ten machine learning methods and twelve patient cohorts.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent malignancy among men worldwide, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a critical turning point commonly used to guide the development of treatment strategies for primary PCa. However, the clinical parameters currently in use are inadequate for precise risk stratification and informing treatment choice. To address this issue, we conducted a study that collected transcriptomic data and clinical information from 1662 primary PCa patients across 12 multicenter cohorts globally. We leveraged 101 algorithm combinations that consisted of 10 machine learning methods to develop and validate a 9-gene signature, named BCR SCR, for predicting the risk of BCR after RP. Our results demonstrated that BCR SCR generally outperformed 102 published prognostic signatures. We further established the clinical significance of these nine genes in PCa progression at the protein level through immunohistochemistry on Tissue Microarray (TMA). Moreover, our data showed that patients with higher BCR SCR tended to have higher rates of BCR and distant metastasis after radical radiotherapy. Through drug target prediction analysis, we identified nine potential therapeutic agents for patients with high BCR SCR. In conclusion, the newly developed BCR SCR has significant translational potential in accurately stratifying the risk of patients who undergo RP, monitoring treatment courses, and developing new therapies for the disease."
38394321,"Yellow scorpion (Buthus sinidicus) venom peptides induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in cervical, prostate and brain tumor cell lines.","Scorpion venoms are known to contain over 100,000 biologically active constituents. However, only a few of them have been studied. The major constituents of venom are proteins and peptides, which exhibit various biological and pharmacological properties, including anticancer activities. In the current study, the venom of yellow scorpions (Buthus sindicus) found in Sindh, Pakistan, was extracted and evaluated for its anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. The crude venom showed a dose dependent inhibition of phagocyte oxidative burst from human whole blood cells (28.3% inhibition at highest tested concentration of 300 mug/mL). In-vitro cytotoxicity of crude venom was evaluated against human prostrate (PC3), cervical (HeLa) and neuroblastoma (U87-MG) cell lines, along with cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblast (BJ) cells. Crude venom was cytotoxic to all cell lines, with prominent inhibitory effect on PC3 cells. Crude venom was fractionated through RP-UPLC, resulted in fifteen fractions, followed by evaluation of their anticancer potential. Among all, the fraction I significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the cell viability of all three cancer cell lines, and exhibited insignificant cytotoxicity against normal cell line. Furthermore, the apoptotic cell death pathway was evaluated for crude venom, and fraction I, in most sensitive cell line PC3, by using flow-cytometry analysis. Both crude venom and its fraction I caused a mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (PC3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity of venom of Pakistani yellow scorpions. Results indicate their therapeutic potential, and a case for further purification and validation studies."
38390963,Phenotype prediction from single-cell RNA-seq data using attention-based neural networks.,"MOTIVATION: A patient's disease phenotype can be driven and determined by specific groups of cells whose marker genes are either unknown or can only be detected at late-stage using conventional bulk assays such as RNA-Seq technology. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable gene expression profiling in cell-level resolution, and therefore have the potential to identify those cells driving the disease phenotype even while the number of these cells is small. However, most existing methods rely heavily on accurate cell type detection, and the number of available annotated samples is usually too small for training deep learning predictive models. RESULTS: Here, we propose the method ScRAT for phenotype prediction using scRNA-seq data. To train ScRAT with a limited number of samples of different phenotypes, such as coronavirus disease (COVID) and non-COVID, ScRAT first applies a mixup module to increase the number of training samples. A multi-head attention mechanism is employed to learn the most informative cells for each phenotype without relying on a given cell type annotation. Using three public COVID datasets, we show that ScRAT outperforms other phenotype prediction methods. The performance edge of ScRAT over its competitors increases as the number of training samples decreases, indicating the efficacy of our sample mixup. Critical cell types detected based on high-attention cells also support novel findings in the original papers and the recent literature. This suggests that ScRAT overcomes the challenge of missing marker genes and limited sample number with great potential revealing novel molecular mechanisms and/or therapies. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of our proposed method ScRAT is published at https://github.com/yuzhenmao/ScRAT."
38390760,Genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer in Taiwan: A genome-wide association study.,"We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer (PCa) in Taiwan with 1844 cases and 80,709 controls. Thirteen independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10(-8) ). Among these, three were distinct from previously identified loci: rs76072851 in CORO2B gene (15q23), odds ratio (OR) = 1.54, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-1.76, p = 5.30 x 10(-11) ; rs7837051, near two long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, PRNCR1 and PCAT2 (8q24.21), OR = 1.41 (95% CI, 1.31-1.51), p = 8.77 x 10(-21) ; and rs56339048, near an lncRNA gene, CASC8 (8q24.21), OR = 1.25 (95% CI, 1.16-1.35), p = 2.14 x 10(-8) . We refined the lead SNPs for two previously identified SNPs in Taiwanese: rs13255059 (near CASC8), p = 9.02 x 10(-43) , and rs1456315 (inside PRNCR1), p = 4.33 x 10(-42) . We confirmed 35 out of 49 GWAS-identified East Asian PCa susceptibility SNPs. In addition, we identified two SNPs more specific to Taiwanese than East Asians: rs34295433 in LAMC1 (1q25.3) and rs6853490 in PDLIM5 (4q22.3). A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was developed using the 40 validated SNPs and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the GRS to predict PCa was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63-0.71). These identified SNPs provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of prostate carcinogenesis in Taiwan and underscore the significant role of genetic susceptibility in regional differences in PCa incidence."
38386171,Systemic interrogation of immune-oncology-related proteins in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective was to establish whether blood-based leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (LRG1) can predict outcomes in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy (RT) and to determine how it may relate to 92 immune-oncology (I-O)-related proteins in this setting. METHODS: Baseline blood level of LRG1 from patients treated with ADT and RT enrolled in the CuPCa (n = 128) and IMRT (n = 81) studies was measured using ELISA. A longitudinal cohort with matched blood samples from start of ADT, start of RT, and end of RT protocol from 47 patients from the IMRT cohort was used to establish levels of I-O proteins by high-multiplexing Proximal Extension Assay by Olink Proteomics. Statistical analyses using Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and LIMMA analyses were applied to predict the prognostic value of LRG1 and its correlation to I-O proteins. RESULTS: High baseline levels of LRG1 predicted a low frequency of treatment failure in patients undergoing ADT + RT in both the CuPCa and the IMRT cohorts. LRG1 was moderately correlated with CD4, IL6, and CSF1. We identified I-O proteins predicting metastatic failure (MF) at different timepoints. CONCLUSION: LRG1 biomarker is associated with I-O proteins and can be used to improve stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT + RT. This work will require further in-depth analyses in independent cohorts with treatment outcome data."
38384854,An integrative proteomics approach identifies tyrosine kinase KIT as a therapeutic target for SPINK1-positive prostate cancer.,"Elevated serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) levels in  approximately 10%-25% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients associate with aggressive phenotype, for which there are limited treatment choices and dismal clinical outcomes. Using an integrative proteomics approach involving label-free phosphoproteome and proteome profiling, we delineated the downstream signaling pathways involved in SPINK1-mediated tumorigenesis and identified tyrosine kinase KIT as highly enriched. Furthermore, high to moderate levels of KIT expression were detected in  approximately 85% of SPINK1-positive PCa specimens. We show KIT signaling orchestrates SPINK1-mediated oncogenesis, and treatment with KIT inhibitor reduces tumor growth and metastases in preclinical mice models. Mechanistically, KIT signaling modulates WNT/beta-catenin pathway and confers stemness-related features in PCa. Notably, inhibiting KIT signaling led to restoration of AR/REST levels, forming a feedback loop enabling SPINK1 repression. Overall, we uncover the role of KIT signaling downstream of SPINK1 in maintaining lineage plasticity and provide distinct treatment modalities for advanced-stage SPINK1-positive patients."
38384328,The FTO Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Modification of DDIT4 Regulation with Tumorigenesis and Metastasis in Prostate Cancer.,"The progression of numerous malignancies has been linked to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) alteration. However, the opposite trend of m6A levels in the development and metastasis of cancer has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the biological function and mechanism of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in regulating m6A modification in prostate cancer development and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An EMT model of LNCaP and PC-3 cells was established with transforming growth factor-beta treatment, and FTO knockout cell line was established in prostate cancer cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. The level of m6A modification in tumor tissues was higher than that in normal prostate tissues; m6A levels were decreased after EMT. FTO deletion increased m6A expression and enhanced PC-3 cell motility, invasion, and EMT both in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and functional investigations suggested that DDIT4, a novel EMT target gene, plays a role in m6A-regulated EMT, which was recognized and stabilized by the m6A effector IGF2BP2/3. Decreased FTO expression was an independent indicator of worse survival, and the level of DDIT4 was considerably elevated in patients with bone metastasis. Thus, this study revealed that the m6A demethylase FTO can play different roles in prostate cancer as a regulator of EMT and an inhibitor of m6A modification. Moreover, DDIT4 can be suggested as a possible biomarker for prostate cancer metastasis prediction."
38383885,Clinical implications of AR alterations in advanced prostate cancer: a multi-institutional collaboration.,"BACKGROUND: AR gene alterations can develop in response to pressure of testosterone suppression and androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA). Despite this, the relevance of these gene alterations in the context of ARTA treatment and clinical outcomes remains unclear. METHODS: Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had undergone genomic testing and received ARTA treatment were identified in the Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine Multi-Institutional Collaborative Effort (PROMISE) database. Patients were stratified according to the timing of genomic testing relative to the first ARTA treatment (pre-/post-ARTA). Clinical outcomes such as time to progression, PSA response, and overall survival were compared based on alteration types. RESULTS: In total, 540 CRPC patients who received ARTA and had tissue-based (n = 321) and/or blood-based (n = 244) genomic sequencing were identified. Median age was 62 years (range 39-90) at the time of the diagnosis. Majority were White (72.2%) and had metastatic disease (92.6%) at the time of the first ARTA treatment. Pre-ARTA genomic testing was available in 24.8% of the patients, and AR mutations and amplifications were observed in 8.2% and 13.1% of the patients, respectively. Further, time to progression was longer in patients with AR amplifications (25.7 months) compared to those without an AR alteration (9.6 months; p = 0.03). In the post-ARTA group (n = 406), AR mutations and AR amplifications were observed in 18.5% and 35.7% of the patients, respectively. The most common mutation in post-ARTA group was L702H (9.9%). CONCLUSION: In this real-world clinicogenomics database-driven study we explored the development of AR alterations and their association with ARTA treatment outcomes. Our study showed that AR amplifications are associated with longer time to progression on first ARTA treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies for patients with AR alterations."

38381937,Addressing controversial areas in the management of advanced prostate cancer in Canada Areas of consensus and controversy from the third Canadian consensus forum.,"INTRODUCTION: The management of prostate cancer (PCa) is rapidly evolving. Treatment and diagnostic options grow annually, however, high-level evidence for the use of new therapeutics and diagnostics is lacking. In November 2022, the Genitourinary Research Consortium held its 3(rd) Canadian Consensus Forum (CCF3) to provide guidance on key controversial areas for management of PCa. METHODS: A steering committee of eight multidisciplinary physicians identified topics for discussion and adapted questions from the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2022 for CCF3. Questions focused on management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC); use of novel imaging, germline testing, and genomic profiling; and areas of non-consensus from CCF2. Fifty-eight questions were voted on during a live forum, with threshold for ""consensus agreement"" set at 75%. RESULTS: The voting panel consisted of 26 physicians: 13 urologists/uro-oncologists, nine medical oncologists, and four radiation oncologists. Consensus was reached for 32 of 58 questions (one ad-hoc). Consensus was seen in the use of local treatment, to not use metastasis-directed therapy for low-volume mCSPC, and to use triplet therapy for synchronous high-volume mCSPC (low prostate-specific antigen). Consensus was also reached on sufficiency of conventional imaging to manage disease, use of germline testing and genomic profiling for metastatic disease, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for BRCA-positive prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: CCF3 identified consensus agreement and provides guidance on >30 practice scenarios related to management of PCa and nine areas of controversy, which represent opportunities for research and education to improve patient care. Consensus initiatives provide valuable guidance on areas of controversy as clinicians await high-level evidence."
38379272,Epigenetics as a Key Factor in Prostate Cancer.,"Nowadays, prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of malignant neoplasms in men all over the world. Against the background of increasing incidence, there is a high mortality rate from prostate cancer, which is associated with an inadequate treatment strategy. Such a high prevalence of prostate cancer requires the development of methods that can ensure early detection of the disease, improve the effectiveness of treatment, and predict the therapeutic effect. Under these circumstances, it becomes crucial to focus on the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Due to the development of molecular genetic methods, a large number of studies have been accumulated on the role of epigenetic regulation of gene activity in cancer development, since it is epigenetic changes that can be detected at the earliest stages of cancer development. The presence of epigenetic aberrations in tumor tissue and correlations with drug resistance suggest new therapeutic approaches. Detection of epigenetic alterations such as CpG island methylation, histone modification, and microRNAs as biomarkers will improve the diagnosis of the disease, and the use of these strategies as targets for therapy will allow for greater personalization of prostate cancer treatment."
38378450,Long-read sequencing reveals the structural complexity of genomic integration of HPV DNA in cervical cancer cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) causes more than 311,000 deaths annually worldwide. The integration of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a crucial genetic event that contributes to cervical carcinogenesis. Despite HPV DNA integration is known to disrupt the genomic architecture of both the host and viral genomes in CC, the complexity of this process remains largely unexplored. RESULTS: In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at 55-65X coverage utilizing the PacBio long-read sequencing platform in SiHa and HeLa cells, followed by comprehensive analyses of the sequence data to elucidate the complexity of HPV integration. Firstly, our results demonstrated that PacBio long-read sequencing effectively identifies HPV integration breakpoints with comparable accuracy to targeted-capture Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Secondly, we constructed detailed models of complex integrated genome structures that included both the HPV genome and nearby regions of the human genome by utilizing PacBio long-read WGS. Thirdly, our sequencing results revealed the occurrence of a wide variety of genome-wide structural variations (SVs) in SiHa and HeLa cells. Additionally, our analysis further revealed a potential correlation between changes in gene expression levels and SVs on chromosome 13 in the genome of SiHa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Using PacBio long-read sequencing, we have successfully constructed complex models illustrating HPV integrated genome structures in SiHa and HeLa cells. This accomplishment serves as a compelling demonstration of the valuable capabilities of long-read sequencing in detecting and characterizing HPV genomic integration structures within human cells. Furthermore, these findings offer critical insights into the complex process of HPV16 and HPV18 integration and their potential contribution to the development of cervical cancer."
38376699,Identifying the tumor immune microenvironment-associated prognostic genes for prostate cancer.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore novel tumor immune microenvironment (TIME)-associated biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). METHODS: PRAD RNA-sequencing data were obtained from UCSC Xena database as the training dataset. The ESTIMATE package was used to evaluate stromal, immune, and tumor purity scores. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to TIME were screened using the immune and stromal scores. Gene functions were analyzed using DAVID. The LASSO method was performed to screen prognostic TIME-related genes. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the prognosis of samples. The correlation between the screened genes and immune cell infiltration was explored using Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource. The GSE70768 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus was used to validate the expression of the screened genes. RESULTS: The ESTIMATE results revealed that high immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores and low tumor purity had better prognoses. Function analysis indicated that DEGs are involved in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway. In TIME-related DEGs, METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 were closely related to the prognosis. Samples with low expression levels of METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 had better survival times. Similarly, both the validation dataset and qRT-PCR suggested that METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1 were significantly decreased. The three genes showed a positive correlation with immune infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified three TIME-related genes, namely, METTL7B, HOXB8, and TREM1, which correlated with the prognosis of patients with PRAD. Targeting the TIME-related genes might have important clinical implications when making decisions for immunotherapy in PRAD."
38376311,Assessment and clinicopathological correlation of p16 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma of Indian population: Diagnostic implications.,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess the p16 expression in normal cervical epithelium and cervical lesions and how it correlated with HPV oncoprotein E7 and other etiological parameters of cervical cancer. METHODS: For this purpose, we analyzed protein expression of p16 and E7 oncoprotein in total 20 normal cervical epithelium tissue (as control) and 62 cervical lesions. Next, the result was correlated with different clinico-pathological parameters. RESULTS: Out of 62 cases of cervical lesions, we found around 75%-100% of the cervical lesion samples exhibited E7 nuclear protein expression, whereas around 33.33%-75% samples were p16 positive. On the other hand, p16 expression showed strong association with E7 oncoprotein and other clinico-pathological parameters (like high parity, early age of sextual debut) in the same set of samples of our study. CONCLUSION: We concluded that overexpression of p16 is very practical and can be readily implemented in most diagnostic pathology laboratories."
38374116,"Intra-prostatic tumour evolution, steps in metastatic spread and histogenomic associations revealed by integration of multi-region whole-genome sequencing with histopathological features.","BACKGROUND: Extension of prostate cancer beyond the primary site by local invasion or nodal metastasis is associated with poor prognosis. Despite significant research on tumour evolution in prostate cancer metastasis, the emergence and evolution of cancer clones at this early stage of expansion and spread are poorly understood. We aimed to delineate the routes of evolution and cancer spread within the prostate and to seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, linking these to histological features that are used in diagnostic risk stratification. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing on 42 prostate cancer samples from the prostate, seminal vesicles and lymph nodes of five treatment-naive patients with locally advanced disease. We spatially mapped the clonal composition of cancer across the prostate and the routes of spread of cancer cells within the prostate and to seminal vesicles and lymph nodes in each individual by analysing a total of > 19,000 copy number corrected single nucleotide variants. RESULTS: In each patient, we identified sample locations corresponding to the earliest part of the malignancy. In patient 10, we mapped the spread of cancer from the apex of the prostate to the seminal vesicles and identified specific genomic changes associated with the transformation of adenocarcinoma to amphicrine morphology during this spread. Furthermore, we show that the lymph node metastases in this patient arose from specific cancer clones found at the base of the prostate and the seminal vesicles. In patient 15, we observed increased mutational burden, altered mutational signatures and histological changes associated with whole genome duplication. In all patients in whom histological heterogeneity was observed (4/5), we found that the distinct morphologies were located on separate branches of their respective evolutionary trees. CONCLUSIONS: Our results link histological transformation with specific genomic alterations and phylogenetic branching. These findings have implications for diagnosis and risk stratification, in addition to providing a rationale for further studies to characterise the genetic changes causally linked to morphological transformation. Our study demonstrates the value of integrating multi-region sequencing with histopathological data to understand tumour evolution and identify mechanisms of prostate cancer spread."
38373667,Clinical value of molecular subtypes identification based on anoikis-related lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Anoikis is a distinctive type of apoptosis. It is involved in tumor progression and metastasis. But its function in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains veiled. We aimed to develop a prognostic indicator based on anoikis-related long non-coding RNAs (arlncRNAs) and to investigate their biological function in CRPC. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Differentially expressed anoikis-related genes were extracted from two CRPC datasets, GSE51873, and GSE78201. Four lncRNAs associated with the anoikis-related genes were selected. A risk model based on these lncRNAs was developed and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prostate cancer cohorts. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoints expression, and drug susceptibility were performed based on the model. To identify the biofunction of anoikis-related lncRNA, CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, and flow cytometry were used. RESULT: Twenty-nine anoikis-related genes were differentially expressed in the CRPC datasets. And 36 prognostic arlncRNAs were selected for the LASSO Cox analysis. Patients were subsequently classified into two subtypes by constructing an anoikis-related lncRNA based prognostic index (ARPI). The accuracy of this index was validated. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the high-ARPI group was enriched in cancer-related and immune-related pathways. Immune infiltration analysis has indicated a positive association between high-ARPI groups and increased immune infiltration. Fulvestrant, OSI-027, Lapatinib, Dabrafenib, and Palbociclib were identified as potential sensitive drugs for high-ARPI patients. In vitro experiments exhibited that silencing LINC01138 dampened the proliferation, migration and enzalutamide resistance in CRPC. Furthermore, it stimulated apoptosis and inhibited the eithelial-mesenchymal transition process. CONCLUSION: Four arlncRNAs were identified and a risk model was established to predict the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer. Immune infiltration and drug susceptibility analysis revealed a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer."
38370835,Localized high-risk prostate cancer harbors an androgen receptor low subpopulation susceptible to HER2 inhibition.,"Patients diagnosed with localized high-risk prostate cancer have higher rates of recurrence, and the introduction of neoadjuvant intensive hormonal therapies seeks to treat occult micrometastatic disease by their addition to definitive treatment. Sufficient profiling of baseline disease has remained a challenge in enabling the in-depth assessment of phenotypes associated with exceptional vs. poor pathologic responses after treatment. In this study, we report comprehensive and integrative gene expression profiling of 37 locally advanced prostate tumors prior to six months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus the androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor enzalutamide prior to radical prostatectomy. A robust transcriptional program associated with HER2 activity was positively associated with poor outcome and opposed AR activity, even after adjusting for common genomic alterations in prostate cancer including PTEN loss and expression of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion. Patients experiencing exceptional pathologic responses demonstrated lower levels of HER2 and phospho-HER2 by immunohistochemistry of biopsy tissues. The inverse correlation of AR and HER2 activity was found to be a universal feature of all aggressive prostate tumors, validated by transcriptional profiling an external cohort of 121 patients and immunostaining of tumors from 84 additional patients. Importantly, the AR activity-low, HER2 activity-high cells that resist ADT are a pre-existing subset of cells that can be targeted by HER2 inhibition alone or in combination with enzalutamide. In summary, we show that prostate tumors adopt an AR activity-low prior to antiandrogen exposure that can be exploited by treatment with HER2 inhibitors."
38370412,ErbB2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates human papillomavirus promoter activity.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a major cause of cancer. While surgical intervention remains effective for a majority of HPV-caused cancers, the urgent need for medical treatments targeting HPV-infected cells persists. The pivotal early genes E6 and E7, which are under the control of the viral genome's long control region (LCR), play a crucial role in infection and HPV-induced oncogenesis, as well as immune evasion. In this study, proteomic analysis of endosomes uncovered the co-internalization of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase, also called HER2/neu, with HPV16 particles from the plasma membrane. Although ErbB2 overexpression has been associated with cervical cancer, its influence on HPV infection stages was previously unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of ErbB2 in HPV infection, focusing on HPV16. Through siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition studies, we found that HPV16 entry is independent of ErbB2. Instead, our signal transduction and promoter assays unveiled a concentration- and activation-dependent regulatory role of ErbB2 on the HPV16 LCR by supporting viral promoter activity. We also found that ErbB2's nuclear localization signal was not essential for LCR activity, but rather the cellular ErbB2 protein level and activation status that were inhibited by tucatinib and CP-724714. These ErbB2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as ErbB2 depletion significantly influenced the downstream Akt and ERK signaling pathways and LCR activity. Experiments encompassing low-risk HPV11 and high-risk HPV18 LCRs uncovered, beyond HPV16, the importance of ErbB2 in the general regulation of the HPV early promoter. Expanding our investigation to directly assess the impact of ErbB2 on viral gene expression, quantitative analysis of E6 and E7 transcript levels in HPV16 and HPV18 transformed cell lines unveiled a noteworthy decrease in oncogene expression following ErbB2 depletion, concomitant with the downregulation of Akt and ERK signaling pathways. In light of these findings, we propose that ErbB2 holds promise as potential target for treating HPV infections and HPV-associated malignancies by silencing viral gene expression."
38369705,Cross-individual cancer transmission to children during the gestational and perinatal periods.,"Cancer transmission may rarely occur between individuals. Besides through allogenic transplantation, cancer transmission via the hemochorial placenta, which is permissive for cell traffic, has been described in a few reports. Three etiologies of transplacental cancer transmission include (1) maternofetal transmission of maternal cancer cells, (2) transmission of gestational choriocarcinoma to the fetus, and (3) transfer of preleukemic cells from one monozygotic twin to the other. Additionally, we recently reported two pediatric cases of lung tumors in which the lung-only distribution of tumors and genomic profiling of both the child's and mother's tumor samples suggested the airway/transbronchial transmission of maternal cervical cancer cells to the child by aspiration at birth. The immune system coordinates the hemostatic balance between effector and regulatory immunity, especially during fetal development. The immunoregulatory properties are shared in both physiological pregnancy-related and pathological cancer-related conditions. Mechanistically, the survival and colonization of transmitted cancer cells within a child are likely attributed to a combination of the child's immune tolerance and the cancer's immune escape. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of gestational/perinatal cancer transmission and discuss the possible mechanism-based immunotherapy for this rare form of pediatric cancer."
38369514,Associations between gut microbiota and three prostate diseases: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"According to previous observational researches and clinical trials, the gut microbiota is related to prostate diseases. However, the potential association between gut microbiota and prostate disorders is still uncertain. We first identified groups of gut microbiota based on the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels from consortium MiBioGen. And we acquired prostate diseases statistics from the FINNGEN study and PRACTICAL consortium. Next, two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to investigate the potential associations between three prevalent prostate disease and gut microbiota. In addition, we performed a reverse MR analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) test for further research. We investigated the connection between 196 gut microbiota and three prevalent prostate diseases. We identified 42 nominally significant associations and 2 robust causative links. Upon correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, our analysis revealed a positive correlation between the risk of prostatitis and the presence of the taxonomic order Gastranaerophilales. Conversely, the risk of prostate cancer exhibited an inverse correlation with the presence of the taxonomic class Alphaproteobacteria. Our study revealed the potential association between gut microbiota and prostate diseases. The results may be useful in providing new insights for further mechanistic and clinical studies of prostate diseases."
38369337,Comprehensive Molecular Profiling and Clinicopathological Characteristics of Gastric-Type Mucinous Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix in Japanese Women.,"Gastric-type mucinous carcinoma (GAS) of the uterine cervix is the most common adenocarcinoma that develops independently of human papillomavirus infection; it is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poorer prognosis than usual-type endocervical adenocarcinoma. Few studies have examined the molecular profile of GAS, but genetic alterations in TP53 and STK11 have been repeatedly reported. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and molecular profile of GAS. Fresh-frozen tissue specimens and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from 13 patients with GAS treated between January 2000 and December 2020 were analyzed. We performed next-generation sequencing on eight fresh-frozen GAS specimens using the Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (cases 1-8) and the FoundationOne companion diagnostic (F1CDx) assay on six FFPE samples (cases 8-13). Seventy-four genomic alterations were identified in 42 genes. In order of frequency, TP53, ATRX, CDKN2A, KRAS, APC, and STK11 were altered in at least three cases. Targetable genomic alterations were identified in all six patients' specimens analyzed using the F1CDx assay. GAS harbors various genomic alterations associated with sustained activation of signaling pathways or cell cycle regulation in addition to abnormalities in TP53, and precision medicine based on molecular profiling will be necessary to overcome GAS."
38367694,Low-dose polystyrene microplastics exposure impairs fertility in male mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity by affecting prostate function.,"The harmful effects of microplastics (MPs) on male fertility are receiving more and more attention. However, the impact of low-dose MPs exposure on the reproductive function of male mice is still unclear. In this study, we exposed male mice to low-dose MPs (25-30 mug/kg body weight/day) or low-dose MPs combined with high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Our results showed that low-dose MPs exposure or HFD feeding significantly reduced sperm quality and the number of offspring born, while low-dose MPs exposure combined with HFD feeding further enhanced the above effects. The combination of low-dose MPs exposure and HFD feeding resulted in a notable elevation of inflammatory level within the prostate of mice and induced apoptosis of prostate epithelium and a decrease in nutrients (zinc, citrate) in seminal plasma fluid. Our findings in this study could provide valuable clues for better understanding the influence of low-dose MPs exposure on the reproductive system under metabolic disorders and facilitate the development of the prevention of reproductive toxicity caused by MPs exposure."

38365286,Investigating the association between genetically proxied circulating levels of immune checkpoint proteins and cancer survival: protocol for a Mendelian randomisation analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with the traditional drug development pathway, investigating alternative uses for existing drugs (ie, drug repurposing) requires substantially less time, cost and resources. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are licensed for the treatment of certain breast, colorectal, head and neck, lung and melanoma cancers. These drugs target immune checkpoint proteins to reduce the suppression of T cell activation by cancer cells. As T cell suppression is a hallmark of cancer common across anatomical sites, we hypothesise that immune checkpoint inhibitors could be repurposed for the treatment of additional cancers beyond the ones already indicated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use two-sample Mendelian randomisation to investigate the effect of genetically proxied levels of protein targets of two immune checkpoint inhibitors-programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed death ligand 1-on survival of seven cancer types (breast, colorectal, head and neck, lung, melanoma, ovarian and prostate). Summary genetic association data will be obtained from prior genome-wide association studies of circulating protein levels and cancer survival in populations of European ancestry. Various sensitivity analyses will be performed to examine the robustness of findings to potential violations of Mendelian randomisation assumptions, collider bias and the impact of alternative genetic instrument construction strategies. The impact of treatment history and tumour stage on the findings will also be investigated using summary-level and individual-level genetic data where available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No separate ethics approval will be required for these analyses as we will be using data from previously published genome-wide association studies which individually gained ethical approval and participant consent. Results from analyses will be submitted as an open-access peer-reviewed publication and statistical code will be made freely available on the completion of the analysis."
38364963,CRISPR genome-wide screening identifies PAK1 as a critical driver of ARSI cross-resistance in prostate cancer progression.,"Next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), such as enzalutamide (Enza) and darolutamide (Daro), are initially effective for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, patients often relapse and develop cross-resistance, which consequently makes drug resistance an inevitable cause of CRPC-related mortality. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of GEO datasets, CRISPR genome-wide screening results, ATAC-seq data, and RNA-seq data, we systemically identified PAK1 as a significant contributor to ARSI cross-resistance due to the activation of the PAK1/RELA/hnRNPA1/AR-V7 axis. Inhibition of PAK1 followed by suppression of NF-kappaB pathways and AR-V7 expression effectively overcomes ARSI cross-resistance. Our findings indicate that PAK1 represents a promising therapeutic target gene for the treatment of ARSI cross-resistant PCa patients in the clinic. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: PAK1 drives ARSI cross-resistance in prostate cancer progression."
38364714,Structure-guided optimization of 3-hydroxybenzoisoxazole derivatives as inhibitors of Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) to target prostate cancer.,"AKR1C3 is an enzyme that is overexpressed in several types of radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-resistant cancers. Despite AKR1C3 is a validated target for drug development, no inhibitor has been approved for clinical use. In this manuscript, we describe our study of a new series of potent AKR1C3-targeting 3-hydroxybenzoisoxazole based inhibitors that display high selectivity over the AKR1C2 isoform and low micromolar activity in inhibiting 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation. In silico studies suggested proper substituents to increase compound potency and provided with a mechanistic explanation that could clarify their different activity, later confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Both the in-silico studies and the crystallographic data highlight the importance of 90 degrees rotation around the single bond of the biphenyl group, in ensuring that the inhibitor can adopt the optimal binding mode within the active pocket. The p-biphenyls that bear the meta-methoxy, and the ortho- and meta-trifluoromethyl substituents (in compounds 6a, 6e and 6f respectively) proved to be the best contributors to cellular potency as they provided the best IC(50) values in series (2.3, 2.0 and 2.4 muM respectively) and showed no toxicity towards human MRC-5 cells. Co-treatment with scalar dilutions of either compound 6 or 6e and the clinically used drug abiraterone led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation, and thus confirmed that treatment with both CYP171A1-and AKR1C3-targeting compounds possess the potential to intervene in key steps in the steroidogenic pathway. Taken together, the novel compounds display desirable biochemical potency and cellular target inhibition as well as good in-vitro ADME properties, which highlight their potential for further preclinical studies."
38363296,Tsyn-Seq: a T-cell Synapse-Based Antigen Identification Platform.,"Tools for genome-wide rapid identification of peptide-major histocompatibility complex targets of T-cell receptors (TCR) are not yet universally available. We present a new antigen screening method, the T-synapse (Tsyn) reporter system, which includes antigen-presenting cells (APC) with a Fas-inducible NF-kappaB reporter and T cells with a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) reporter. To functionally screen for target antigens from a cDNA library, productively interacting T cell-APC aggregates were detected by dual-reporter activity and enriched by flow sorting followed by antigen identification quantified by deep sequencing (Tsyn-seq). When applied to a previously characterized TCR specific for the E7 antigen derived from human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), Tsyn-seq successfully enriched the correct cognate antigen from a cDNA library derived from an HPV16-positive cervical cancer cell line. Tsyn-seq provides a method for rapidly identifying antigens recognized by TCRs of interest from a tumor cDNA library. See related Spotlight by Makani and Joglekar, p. 515."
38362852,The heterogeneous cancer phenotype of individuals with biallelic germline pathogenic variants in CHEK2.,"PURPOSE: Females with biallelic CHEK2 germline pathogenic variants (gPVs) more often develop multiple breast cancers than individuals with monoallelic CHEK2 gPVs. This study is aimed at expanding the knowledge on the occurrence of other malignancies. METHODS: Exome sequencing of individuals who developed multiple primary malignancies identified 3 individuals with the CHEK2 (NM_007194.4) c.1100del p.(Thr367MetfsTer15) loss-of-function gPV in a biallelic state. We collected the phenotypes of an additional cohort of individuals with CHEK2 biallelic gPVs (n = 291). RESULTS: In total, 157 individuals (53.4%; 157/294 individuals) developed >/=1 (pre)malignancy. The most common (pre)malignancies next to breast cancer were colorectal- (n = 19), thyroid- (n = 19), and prostate (pre)malignancies (n = 12). Females with biallelic CHEK2 loss-of-function gPVs more frequently developed >/=2 (pre)malignancies and at an earlier age compared with females biallelic for the CHEK2 c.470T>C p.(Ile157Thr) missense variant. Furthermore, 26 males (31%; 26/84 males) with CHEK2 biallelic gPVs developed >/=1 (pre)malignancies of 15 origins. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that CHEK2 biallelic gPVs likely increase the susceptibility to develop multiple malignancies in various tissues, both in females and males. However, it is possible that a substantial proportion of individuals with CHEK2 biallelic gPVs is missed as diagnostic testing for CHEK2 often is limited to individuals who developed breast cancer."

38361268,"Unveiling hormone-stimulated gene mechanisms in prostate cancer: A prognostic model, immune infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity study.","Hormones promote the progression of prostate cancer (PRCA) through the activation of a complex regulatory network. Inhibition of hormones or modulation of specific network nodes alone is insufficient to suppress the entire oncogenic network. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of PRCA in order to identify reliable diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. To this end, we used publicly available data to analyze the potential mechanisms of hormone-stimulated genes in PRCA, construct a prognostic model, and assess immune infiltration and drug sensitivity. The single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PRCA were subjected to dimensionality reduction clustering and annotation, and the cells were categorized into two groups based on hormone stimulus-related scores. The differentially expressed genes between the two groups were screened and incorporated into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator machine learning algorithm, and a prognostic model comprising six genes (ZNF862, YIF1A, USP22, TAF7, SRSF3, and SPARC) was constructed. The robustness of the model was validation through multiple methods. Immune infiltration scores in the two risk groups were calculated using three different algorithms. In addition, the relationship between the model genes and immune cell infiltration, and that between risk score and immune cell infiltration were analyzed. Drug sensitivity analysis was performed for the model genes and risk score using public databases to identify potential candidate drugs. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of hormone-stimulated genes in PRCA progression, prognosis, and drug screening."
38361103,Triple Primary Cancers: An Analysis of Genetic and Environmental Factors.,"The occurrence of multiple primary cancers (MPC) is thought to reflect increased cancer susceptibility in patients due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Here we conducted a retrospective review of 2,894 consecutive patients evaluated at a single institution and identified 31 (1.14%) individuals with a history of three or more primary cancers, then analyzed the genetic and environmental influences associated with their propensity for developing malignancies. We found that 35.5% of patients had a hereditary cancer syndrome (HCS), with high penetrance HCS in 72.7% of cases, suggesting that monogenic causes underly a significant proportion of triple primary cancer risk. Analysis of cancer frequencies found that the diagnosis of breast cancer was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of HCS, while the diagnosis of colorectal, prostate, and pancreas cancer was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of HCS. Comparison of HCS-positive and HCS-negative patients revealed similar demographic characteristics, mean age at first diagnosis, and family history of cancer. Moreover, no significant differences in lifestyle behaviors, occupational exposures, chronic health conditions, or treatment with chemotherapy and radiation were observed between HCS-positive and -negative groups, though outliers in tobacco smoking, as well as systemic treatment after both first and second primary cancers were observed. These findings indicate a robust contribution of HCS to cancer susceptibility among patients with triple primary cancers while environmental influences were less evident. This emphasizes the need for larger MPC cohorts incorporating additional genetic and environmental factors to more comprehensively characterize drivers of cancer risk. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: In patients with three or more primary cancers, genetic predisposition explained a significant proportion of cases; however, treatment history, lifestyle habits, and other exposures appeared to play a less significant role. This highlights the value of early genetic screening and the need to develop more sensitive markers of cancer susceptibility. See related Spotlight, p. 193."

38355834,Convergent evolution of BRCA2 reversion mutations under therapeutic pressure by PARP inhibition and platinum chemotherapy.,"Reversion mutations that restore wild-type function of the BRCA gene have been described as a key mechanism of resistance to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy in BRCA-associated cancers. Here, we report a case of a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with a germline BRCA2 mutation who developed acquired resistance to PARP inhibition. Extensive genomic interrogation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tissue at baseline, post-progression, and postmortem revealed ten unique BRCA2 reversion mutations across ten sites. While several of the reversion mutations were private to a specific site, nine out of ten tumors contained at least one mutation, suggesting a powerful clonal selection for reversion mutations in the presence of therapeutic pressure by PARP inhibition. Variable cfDNA shed was seen across tumor sites, emphasizing a potential shortcoming of cfDNA monitoring for PARPi resistance. This report provides a genomic portrait of the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of prostate cancer under the selective pressure of a PARP inhibition and exposes limitations in the current strategies for detection of reversion mutations."
38355628,Germline mutations of 4567 patients with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer spectrum in Thailand.,"Multi-gene panel testing has led to the detection of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in many cancer susceptibility genes in patients with breast-ovarian cancer spectrum. However, the clinical and genomic data of Asian populations, including Thai cancer patients, was underrepresented, and the clinical significance of multi-gene panel testing in Thailand remains undetermined. In this study, we collected the clinical and genetic data from 4567 Thai patients with cancer in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) spectrum who underwent multi-gene panel testing. Six hundred and ten individuals (13.4%) had germline P/LP variants. Detection rates of germline P/LP variants in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer were 11.8%, 19.8%, 14.0%, and 7.1%, respectively. Non-BRCA gene mutations accounted for 35% of patients with germline P/LP variants. ATM was the most common non-BRCA gene mutation. Four hundred and thirty-two breast cancer patients with germline P/LP variants (80.4%) met the current NCCN genetic testing criteria. The most common indication was early-onset breast cancer. Ten patients harbored double pathogenic variants in this cohort. Our result showed that a significant proportion of non-BRCA P/LP variants were identified in patients with HBOC-related cancers. These findings support the benefit of multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer susceptibility among Thai HBOC patients. Some modifications of the testing policy may be appropriate for implementation in diverse populations."
38352515,"Meta-analyses of mouse and human prostate single-cell transcriptomes reveal widespread epithelial plasticity in tissue regression, regeneration, and cancer.","Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have facilitated studies of cell states and plasticity in tissue maintenance and cancer, including in the prostate. Here we present meta-analyses of multiple new and published scRNA-seq datasets to establish reference cell type classifications for the normal mouse and human prostate. Our analyses demonstrate transcriptomic similarities between epithelial cell states in the normal prostate, in the regressed prostate after androgen-deprivation, and in primary prostate tumors. During regression in the mouse prostate, all epithelial cells shift their expression profiles towards a proximal periurethral (PrU) state, demonstrating an androgen-dependent plasticity that is restored to normal during androgen restoration and regeneration. In the human prostate, we find progressive rewiring of transcriptional programs across epithelial cell types in benign prostate hyperplasia and treatment-naive prostate cancer. Notably, we detect copy number variants predominantly within Luminal Acinar cells in prostate tumors, suggesting a bias in their cell type of origin, as well as a larger field of transcriptomic alterations in non-tumor cells. Finally, we observe that Luminal Acinar tumor cells in treatment-naive prostate cancer display heterogeneous androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity, including a split between high-AR and low-AR profiles with similarity to PrU-like states. Taken together, our analyses of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity provide important translational insights into the origin and treatment response of prostate cancer."
38352401,Cooperativity of c-MYC with Kruppel-Like Factor 6 Splice Variant 1 induces phenotypic plasticity and promotes prostate cancer progression and metastasis.,"Metastasis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in men with prostate cancer, and the functional impact of the genetic alterations, alone or in combination, driving metastatic disease remains incompletely understood. The proto-oncogene c-MYC, commonly deregulated in prostate cancer. Transgenic expression of c-MYC is sufficient to drive the progression to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and ultimately to moderately differentiated localized primary tumors, however, c-MYC-driven tumors are unable to progress through the metastatic cascade, suggesting that a ""second-hit"" is necessary in the milieu of aberrant c-MYC-driven signaling. Here, we identified cooperativity between c-MYC and KLF6-SV1, an oncogenic splice variant of the KLF6 gene. Transgenic mice that co-expressed KLF6-SV1 and c-MYC developed progressive and metastatic prostate cancer with a histological and molecular phenotype like human prostate cancer. Silencing c-MYC expression significantly reduced tumor burden in these mice supporting the necessity for c-MYC in tumor maintenance. Unbiased global proteomic analysis of tumors from these mice revealed significantly enriched vimentin, a dedifferentiation and pro-metastatic marker, induced by KLF6-SV1. c-MYC-positive tumors were also significantly enriched for KLF6-SV1 in human prostate cancer specimens. Our findings provide evidence that KLF6-SV1 is an enhancer of c-MYC-driven prostate cancer progression and metastasis, and a correlated genetic event in human prostate cancer with potential translational significance."
38352226,"Toward ovarian cancer screening with protein biomarkers using dried, self-sampled cervico-vaginal fluid.","Early detection is key for increased survival in ovarian cancer, but no general screening program exists today due to lack of biomarkers and overall cost versus benefit over traditional clinical methods. Here, we used dried cervico-vaginal fluid (CVF) as sampling matrix coupled with mass spectrometry for detection of protein biomarkers. We find that self-collected CVF on paper cards yields robust results and is suitable for high-throughput proteomics. Artificial intelligence-based methods were used to identify an 11-protein panel that separates cases from controls. In validation data, the panel achieved a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91-1.00) at a specificity of 0.67 (0.40-0.87). Analyses of samples collected prior to development of symptoms indicate that the panel is informative also of future risk of disease. Dried CVF is used in cervical cancer screening, and our results opens the possibility for a screening program also for ovarian cancer, based on self-collected CVF samples."
38349963,CRISPR-Based Multiplex Detection of Human Papillomaviruses for One-Pot Point-of-Care Diagnostics.,"The World Health Organization's global initiative toward eliminating high-risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV)-related cancers recommends DNA testing over visual inspection in all settings for primary cancer screening and HPV eradication by 2100. However, multiple hrHPV types cause different types of cancers, and there is a pressing need for an easy-to-use, multiplex point-of-care diagnostic platform for detecting different hrHPV types. Recently, CRISPR-Cas systems have been repurposed for point-of-care detection. Here, we established a CRISPR-Cas multiplexed diagnostic assay (CRISPRD) to detect cervical cancer-causing hrHPVs in one reaction (one-pot assay). We harnessed the compatibility of thermostable AapCas12b, TccCas13a, and HheCas13a nucleases with isothermal amplification and successfully detected HPV16 and HPV18, along with an internal control in a single-pot assay with a limit of detection of 10 copies and 100% specificity. This platform offers a rapid and practical solution for the multiplex detection of hrHPVs, which may facilitate large-scale hrHPV point-of-care screening. Furthermore, the CRISPRD platform programmability enables it to be adapted for the multiplex detection of any two nucleic acid biomarkers as well as internal control."
38348927,Development of the quantitative PET prostate phantom (Q3P) for improved quality assurance of (18)F-PSMA PET imaging in metastatic prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Phantoms are commonly used to evaluate and compare the performance of imaging systems given the known ground truth. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are routinely validated using the NEMA image quality phantom, in which lesions are modeled using 10 to 37 mm fillable spheres. The NEMA phantom neglects, however, to model focal (3-10-mm), high-uptake lesions that are increasingly observed in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET images. PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals allow for enhanced detection of metastatic prostate cancers. As such, there is significant need to develop an updated phantom which considers both the quantitative and lesion detectability of this new paradigm in oncological PET imaging. PURPOSE: In this work, we present the Quantitative PET Prostate Phantom (Q3P); a portable and modular phantom that can be used to improve and harmonize imaging protocols for (18)F-PSMA PET scans. METHODS: A one-piece cylindrical phantom was designed effectively in two halves, which we call modules. Module 1 was designed to mimic lesions in the presence of background, and Module 2 mimicked very high contrast conditions (i.e., very low background) that can be observed in (18)F-PSMA PET scans. Shell-less radioactive spheres (3-16-mm) were cast using epoxy resin mixed with sodium-22 ((22)Na), a long half-life positron emitter with positron range similar to (18)F. To establish realistic lesion contrast, the (22)Na spheres were mounted in a cylindrical chamber that can be filled with an (18)F background (module 1). Thirteen exchangeable spherical cavity inserts (3-37-mm) were machined in two parts and solvent welded together, and filled with (18)F (50 kBq/mL) to model lesions with very high contrast (module 2). Five 2.5-min PET scans were acquired on a 5-ring GE Discovery MI PET/CT scanner (General Electric, USA). Lesions were segmented using 41% of SUV(max) fixed thresholding (41% FT) and recovery coefficients (RCs) were computed from 5 noise realizations. RESULTS: The manufactured phantom is portable (5.7 kg) and scan preparation takes less than 40 min. The total (22)Na activity is 250 kBq, allowing it to be shipped as an exempt package under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations. Recovery coefficients, computed using PSF modeling and no post-reconstruction smoothing, were 130.3% (16 mm), 147.1% (10 mm), 87.2% (6 mm), and 7.0% (3 mm) for RC(max), which decreased to 91.1% (16 mm), 90.6% (10 mm), 53.2% (6 mm), and 3.6% (3 mm) for RC(mean) in the (22)Na spheres. Comparatively, (18)F sphere recovery was 110.7% (17 mm), 123.6% (10 mm), 106.5% (7 mm), and 23.3% (3 mm) for RC(max), which was reduced to 76.7% (17 mm), 77.7% (10 mm), 66.8% (7 mm), and 13.5% (3 mm), for RC(mean). CONCLUSIONS: A standardized imaging phantom was developed for lesion quantification assessment in (18)F-PSMA PET images. The phantom is configurable, providing users with the opportunity to modify background activity levels or sphere sizes according to clinical demands. Distributed to the community, the Q3P phantom has the potential to enable better assessment of lesion quantification and harmonization of (18)F-PSMA PET imaging, which may lead to more robust predictive metrics and better outcome prediction in metastatic prostate cancer."
38348104,"Causal associations between prostate diseases, renal diseases, renal function, and erectile dysfunction risk: a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study.","BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have found a potential link between prostate disease, particularly prostate cancer (PCa), and kidney disease, specifically chronic renal disease (CKD), in relation to erectile dysfunction (ED), yet the causal relationship between these factors remains uncertain. AIM: The study sought to explore the potential causal association between prostate diseases, renal diseases, renal function, and risk of ED. METHODS: In this study, 5 analytical approaches were employed to explore the causal relationships between various prostate diseases (PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia), renal diseases (CKD, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney ureter calculi), as well as 8 renal function parameters, with regard to ED. All data pertaining to exposure and outcome factors were acquired from publicly accessible genome-wide association studies. The methods used encompassed inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode residual sum and outlier techniques. The MR-Egger intercept test was utilized to assess pleiotropy, while Cochran's Q statistic was employed to measure heterogeneity. OUTCOMES: We employed inverse variance weighting MR as the primary statistical method to assess the causal relationship between exposure factors and ED. RESULTS: Genetically predicted PCa demonstrated a causal association with an elevated risk of ED (odds ratio, 1.125; 95% confidence interval, 1.066-1.186; P < .0001). However, no compelling evidence was found to support associations between genetically determined benign prostatic hyperplasia, CKD, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, kidney ureter calculi, and the renal function parameters investigated, and the risk of ED. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The risk of ED is considerably amplified in patients diagnosed with PCa, thereby highlighting the importance of addressing ED as a significant concern for clinicians treating individuals with PCa. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study's strength lies in validating the PCa-ED association using genetic analysis, while its limitation is the heterogeneity in study results. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a potential link between PCa and a higher risk of ED."
38347787,Activation of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING): Promising Strategy to Overcome Immune Resistance in Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent and second-lethal cancer among men. Despite considerable efforts to explore treatments like autologous cellular immunotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, their success remains limited. The intricate tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interaction with the immune system pose significant challenges in PCa treatment. Consequently, researchers have directed their focus on augmenting the immune system's anti-tumor response by targeting the STimulator of the Interferon Genes (STING) pathway. The STING pathway is activated when foreign DNA is detected in the cytoplasm of innate immune cells, resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) STING. This, in turn, triggers an augmentation of signaling, leading to the production of type I interferon (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Numerous studies have demonstrated that activation of the STING pathway induces immune system rejection and targeted elimination of PCa cells. Researchers have been exploring various methods to activate the STING pathway, including the use of bacterial vectors to deliver STING agonists and the combination of radiation therapy with STING agonists. Achieving effective radiation therapy with minimal side effects and optimal anti-tumor immune responses necessitates precise adjustments to radiation dosing and fractionation schedules. This comprehensive review discusses promising findings from studies focusing on activating the STING pathway to combat PCa. The STING pathway exhibits the potential to serve as an effective treatment modality for PCa, offering new hope for improving the lives of those affected by this devastating disease."
38347726,Staufen1 Represses the FOXA1-Regulated Transcriptome by Destabilizing FOXA1 mRNA in Colorectal Cancer Cells.,"Transcription factors play key roles in development and disease by controlling gene expression. Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), is a pioneer transcription factor essential for mouse development and functions as an oncogene in prostate and breast cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FOXA1 is significantly downregulated and high FOXA1 expression is associated with better prognosis, suggesting potential tumor suppressive functions. We therefore investigated the regulation of FOXA1 expression in CRC, focusing on well-differentiated CRC cells, where FOXA1 is robustly expressed. Genome-wide RNA stability assays identified FOXA1 as an unstable mRNA in CRC cells. We validated FOXA1 mRNA instability in multiple CRC cell lines and in patient-derived CRC organoids, and found that the FOXA1 3'UTR confers instability to the FOXA1 transcript. RNA pulldowns and mass spectrometry identified Staufen1 (STAU1) as a potential regulator of FOXA1 mRNA. Indeed, STAU1 knockdown resulted in increased FOXA1 mRNA and protein expression due to increased FOXA1 mRNA stability. Consistent with these data, RNA-seq following STAU1 knockdown in CRC cells revealed that FOXA1 targets were upregulated upon STAU1 knockdown. Collectively, this study uncovers a molecular mechanism by which FOXA1 is regulated in CRC cells and provides insights into our understanding of the complex mechanisms of gene regulation in cancer."
38347680,Comorbid Dementia and Cancer Therapy Decision-Making: A Scoping Review.,"Comorbid dementia complicates cancer therapy decision-making in older adults. We aimed to synthesize the recent literature (<5 years) on the challenges associated with cancer therapy decision-making among older people living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers. Of the 20,763 references, 8767 had their title and abstract screened, and eight met the inclusion criteria. Six studies were qualitative, one study employed mixed methods, and one study was quasi-experimental. Most studies were conducted in the UK (89%) and reported homogeneity in race and geography. Breast (56%) and prostate (45%) were the most frequent reported cancers. Five studies (56%) reported multiple types of dementia, with two (22%) indicating stages. The studies indicated that communication between patients, caregivers, and clinical teams might alleviate stress caused by worsening health prospects and potential ethical concerns. Information from this review can lead to better-informed, patient-centered treatment decision processes among older PLWD and cancer, their caregivers, and clinicians."
38347538,"46, XX disorder of sexual development associated with mixed germ cell tumor of the prostate: a rare case report.","BACKGROUND: Extragonadal germ cell tumors originating from the prostate are exceptionally rare. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of mixed germ cell tumors in individuals with 46 XX disorder of sex development. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using whole genome sequencing to investigate the clinicopathological and molecular genetic characteristics of a submitted case, with the objective of elucidating its underlying pathogenesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a combination of 46, XX disorder of sex development and a primary prostate mixed germ cell tumor with yolk sac tumor and teratoma components. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the tumor cells had a high somatic mutational load. Analysis of genomic structural variations and copy number variants confirmed the patient's karyotype as 46, XX (SRY +). Additionally, the patient exhibited short stature, small bilateral testes, slightly enlarged breasts, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels, and low testosterone levels. DISCUSSION: A case of 46, XX disorder of sex development, along with a primary prostatic mixed germ cell tumor, was diagnosed. This diagnosis has contributed to advancing our understanding of the genetic and phenotypic profile of the disease and may provide some insights for its treatment."

Despite the current screening methods have been proved effectively and significantly decreased CC morbidity and mortality, deficiencies still exist. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach can identify the complex and rare cell populations at single-cell resolution. By scRNA-seq, the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment across cervical carcinogenesis has been mapped and described. Whether these alterations could be detected and applied to CC screening is unclear. Herein, we performed scRNA-seq of 56,173 cervical exfoliated cells from 15 samples, including normal cervix, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and malignancy. The present study delineated the alteration of immune and epithelial cells derived during the cervical lesion progression. A subset of lipid-associated macrophage was identified as a tumor-promoting element and could serve as a biomarker for predicting the progression of LSIL into HSIL, which was then verified by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis indicated the SPP1-CD44 axis might exhibit a protumor interaction between epithelial cell and macrophage. In this study, we investigated the cervical multicellular ecosystem in cervical carcinogenesis and identified potential biomarkers for early detection."
38346260,Codon usage bias of human papillomavirus type 33 and 58: A comprehensive analysis.,"Cervical cancer is closely linked to specific strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), notably HPV-33 and HPV-58, which exhibit a significant prevalence among women in China. Nevertheless, the codon usage bias in HPV-33 and HPV-58 is not well comprehended. The objective of this research is to analyze the codon usage patterns HPV-33 and HPV-58, pinpoint the primary factors that influence codon preference. The overall preference for codon usage in two HPV genotypes is not significant. Both HPV genotypes exhibit a preference for codons that end with A/U. The GC3 content for HPV-33 is 25.43% +/- 0.35%, and for HPV-58, it is 29.44% +/- 0.57%. Out of the 26 favored codons in HPV-33 and HPV-58 (relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) > 1), 25 conclude with A/U. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows a tight clustering of the entire genome sequences of HPV-33 and HPV-58, suggesting a similarity in their RSCU preferences. Moreover, an examination of dinucleotide abundance indicated that translation selection influenced the development of a distinctive dinucleotide usage pattern in HPV-33 and HPV-58. Additionally, a combined analysis involving an effective number of codons plot, parity rule 2, and neutrality analysis demonstrated that, for HPV-33 and HPV-58, the primary determinant influencing codon usage preference is natural selection. HPV-33 and HPV-58 exhibit a restricted set of favored codons in common with humans, potentially mitigating competition for translation resources. Our discoveries could provide valuable perspectives on the evolutionary patterns and codon usage preferences of HPV-33 and HPV-58 viruses, contributing to the development and application of relevant HPV subtype vaccines."
38345532,Unraveling the Global Proteome and Phosphoproteome of Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenografts.,"Resistance to androgen-deprivation therapies leads to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) of adenocarcinoma (AdCa) origin that can transform into emergent aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC), which has neuroendocrine (NE)-like features. In this work, we used LuCaP patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, clinically relevant models that reflect and retain key features of the tumor from advanced prostate cancer patients. Here we performed proteome and phosphoproteome characterization of 48 LuCaP PDX tumors and identified over 94,000 peptides and 9,700 phosphopeptides corresponding to 7,738 proteins. We compared 15 NE versus 33 AdCa samples, which included six different PDX tumors for each group in biological replicates, and identified 309 unique proteins and 476 unique phosphopeptides that were significantly altered and corresponded to proteins that are known to distinguish these two phenotypes. Assessment of concordance from PDX tumor-matched protein and mRNA revealed increased dissonance in transcriptionally regulated proteins in NE and metabolite interconversion enzymes in AdCa. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, our study highlights the importance of protein-based identification when compared with RNA and provides a rich resource of new and feasible targets for clinical assay development and in understanding the underlying biology of these tumors."
38342956,Pan-cancer analysis reveals potential immunological and prognostic roles of METTL7A in human cancers.,"Methyltransferase-like protein 7A (METTL7A) is an m6A RNA methyltransferase that has been linked to cancer prognosis and drug resistance. However, a comprehensive analysis of METTL7A is lacking. The expression of METTL7A, prognostic performance, correlation with microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and immune infiltration was investigated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to detect METTL7A in 6 tumors. METTL7A was significantly decreased in 19 cancers in TCGA including LUAD. Alterations of METTL7A include amplification and mutation, and epigenetic alterations revealed increased promoter methylation may result in down-regulation of METTL7A in LUAD. We also found that METTL7A was linked to both TMB and MSI in LUAD. METTL7A was increasingly correlated with invasive immune cells, while being negatively associated with Macrophages M0, Mast cells activated, activated memory CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and follicular helper T cells in several tumors. Additionally, METTL7A showed similar correlation with immune therapy-related genes across cancers. Our biological validation found that the protein levels of METTL7A were down-regulated in breast cancer (BRCA), endometrioid cancer (UCEC), colon cancer (COAD), prostate cancer (PRAD), and kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), as detected by immunohistochemistry staining. Overall, our work indicates that METTL7A may serve as promising diagnostic and prognostic indicator of LUAD, and our work sheds light on the potential immunological and prognostic roles of METTL7A in human cancers."
38342659,A Panel-Based Mutational Signature of Mismatch Repair Deficiency is Associated With Durable Response to Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited efficacy in prostate cancer (PCa). Better biomarkers are needed to predict responses to ICIs. We sought to demonstrate that a panel-based mutational signature identifies mismatch repair (MMR) deficient (MMRd) PCa and is a biomarker of response to pembrolizumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinico-genomic data was obtained for 2664 patients with PCa sequenced at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). Clinical outcomes were collected for patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) treated with pembrolizumab at DFCI. SigMA was used to characterize tumors as MMRd or MMR proficient (MMRp). The concordance between MMRd with microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was assessed. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected for patients treated with pembrolizumab. Event-time distributions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. RESULTS: Across both cohorts, 100% (DFCI: 12/12; MSK: 43/43) of MSI-H tumors were MMRd. However, 14% (2/14) and 9.1% (6/66) of MMRd tumors in the DFCI and MSK cohorts respectively were microsatellite stable (MSS), and 26% (17/66) were MSI-indeterminate in the MSK cohort. Among patients treated with pembrolizumab, those with MMRd (n = 5) versus MMRp (n = 14) mCRPC experienced markedly improved rPFS (HR = 0.088, 95% CI: 0.011-0.70; P = .0064) and OS (HR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.014-0.80; P = .010) from start of treatment. Four patients with MMRd experienced remissions of >= 2.5 years. CONCLUSION: SigMA detects additional cases of MMRd as compared to MSI testing in PCa and identifies patients likely to experience durable response to pembrolizumab."
38341849,Single-cell RNA sequencing comparison of the human metastatic prostate spine tumor microenvironment.,"Spinal column tumors can be difficult to process for single-cell omic studies, given the heterogeneity in tissue. Here, we present a protocol for operating room-to-benchtop single-cell processing of clinical specimens from a prostate cancer patient. We describe steps for sample homogenization, red blood cell lysis, cryopreservation, and single-cell sequencing analysis. This protocol can be used to identify prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for patients with osseous spine metastases and better inform eligibility for clinical trials."
38340648,Survival disparities in non-Hispanic Black and White cervical cancer patients vary by histology and are largely explained by modifiable factors.,"PURPOSE: We investigated racial disparities in survival by histology in cervical cancer and examined the factors contributing to these disparities. METHODS: Non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White (hereafter known as Black and White) patients with stage I-IV cervical carcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2017 in the National Cancer Database were studied. Survival differences were compared using Cox modeling to estimate hazard ratio (HR) or adjusted HR (AHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The contribution of demographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors to the Black vs White differences in survival was estimated after applying propensity score weighting in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC). RESULTS: This study included 10,111 Black and 43,252 White patients with cervical cancer. Black patients had worse survival than White cervical cancer patients (HR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.35-1.45). Survival disparities between Black and White patients varied significantly by histology (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.15-1.24 for SCC; HR = 2.32, 95% CI = 2.12-2.54 for AC, interaction p < 0.0001). After balancing the selected demographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors, survival in Black vs. White patients was no longer different in those with SCC (AHR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.06) or AC (AHR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.96-1.24). In SCC, the largest contributors to survival disparities were neighborhood income and insurance. In AC, age was the most significant contributor followed by neighborhood income, insurance, and stage. Diagnosis of AC (but not SCC) at >/=65 years old was more common in Black vs. White patients (26% vs. 13%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Histology matters in survival disparities and diagnosis at >/=65 years old between Black and White cervical cancer patients. These disparities were largely explained by modifiable factors."
38339274,Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Development in the Precision Medicine Era: A Comprehensive Review.,"The progression of prostate cancer (PCa) relies on the activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by androgens. Despite efforts to block this pathway through androgen deprivation therapy, resistance can occur through several mechanisms, including the abnormal activation of AR, resulting in castration-resistant PCa following the introduction of treatment. Mutations, amplifications, and splicing variants in AR-related genes have garnered attention in this regard. Furthermore, recent large-scale next-generation sequencing analysis has revealed the critical roles of AR and AR-related genes, as well as the DNA repair, PI3K, and cell cycle pathways, in the onset and progression of PCa. Moreover, research on epigenomics and microRNA has increasingly become popular; however, it has not translated into the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Additionally, treatments targeting homologous recombination repair mutations and the PI3K/Akt pathway have been developed and are increasingly accessible, and multiple clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this comprehensive review, we outline the status of PCa research in genomics and briefly explore potential future developments in the field of epigenetic modifications and microRNAs."
38339092,Treatments Targeting the Androgen Receptor and Its Splice Variants in Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. The complexity of endocrine regulation in breast cancer may allow the cancer cells to escape from a particular treatment and result in resistant and aggressive disease. These breast cancers usually have fewer treatment options. Targeted therapies for cancer patients may offer fewer adverse side effects because of specificity compared to conventional chemotherapy. Signaling pathways of nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), have been intensively studied and used as therapeutic targets. Recently, the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in breast cancer is gaining greater attention as a therapeutic target and as a prognostic biomarker. The expression of constitutively active truncated AR splice variants in breast cancer is a possible mechanism contributing to treatment resistance. Therefore, targeting both the full-length AR and AR variants, either through the activation or suppression of AR function, depending on the status of the ER, progesterone receptor, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, may provide additional treatment options. Studies targeting AR in combination with other treatment strategies are ongoing in clinical trials. The determination of the status of nuclear receptors to classify and identify patient subgroups will facilitate optimized and targeted combination therapies."
38336745,Androgen deprivation induces double-null prostate cancer via aberrant nuclear export and ribosomal biogenesis through HGF and Wnt activation.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting androgen/androgen receptor (AR)- signaling pathways is the main therapy for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, ADT eventually fails in most patients who consequently develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While more potent AR antagonists and blockers for androgen synthesis were developed to improve clinical outcomes, they also show to induce more diverse CRPC phenotypes. Specifically, the AR- and neuroendocrine-null PCa, DNPC, occurs in abiraterone and enzalutamide-treated patients. Here, we uncover that current ADT induces aberrant HGF/MET signaling activation that further elevates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human DNPC samples. Co-activation of HGF/MET and Wnt/beta-catenin axes in mouse prostates induces DNPC-like lesions. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses identify increased expression and activity of XPO1 and ribosomal proteins in mouse DNPC-like cells. Elevated expression of XPO1 and ribosomal proteins is also identified in clinical DNPC specimens. Inhibition of XPO1 and ribosomal pathways represses DNPC growth in both in vivo and ex vivo conditions, evidencing future therapeutic targets."
38331373,Single-tube four-target lateral flow assay detects human papillomavirus types associated with majority of cervical cancers.,"Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods have many advantages for use at the point of care. However, there is a lack of multiplexed isothermal amplification tests to detect multiple targets in a single reaction, which would be valuable for many diseases, such as infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). In this study, we developed a multiplexed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction to detect the three most common hrHPV types that cause cervical cancer (HPV16, HPV18, and HPV45) and a cellular control for sample adequacy. First, we characterized the assay limit of detection (LOD) in a real-time reaction with fluorescence readout; after 30 min of amplification the LOD was 100, 10, and 10 copies/reaction of HPV16, HPV18, and HPV45, respectively, and 0.1 ng/reaction of human genomic DNA (gDNA). Next, we implemented the assay on lateral flow strips, and the LOD was maintained for HPV16 and HPV18, but increased to 100 copies/reaction for HPV45 and to 1 ng/reaction for gDNA. Lastly, we used the LAMP test to evaluate total nucleic acid extracted from 38 clinical samples; compared to qPCR, the LAMP test had 89% sensitivity and 95% specificity. When integrated with sample preparation, this multiplexed LAMP assay could be useful for point-of-care testing."
38330260,Validation of the Combined Clinical Cell-Cycle Risk Score to Prognosticate Early Prostate Cancer Metastasis From Biopsy Specimens and Comparison With Other Routinely Used Risk Classifiers.,"PURPOSE: We aim to independently validate the prognostic utility of the combined cell-cycle risk (CCR) multimodality threshold to estimate risk of early metastasis after definitive treatment of prostate cancer and compare this prognostic ability with other validated biomarkers. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer were enrolled into a single-institutional registry for the prospective observational cohort study. The primary end point was risk of metastasis within 3 years of diagnostic biopsy. Secondary end points included time to definitive treatment, time to subsequent therapy, and metastasis after completion of initial definitive treatment. Multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models were produced accounting for competing risk of death and stratified on the basis of the CCR active surveillance and multimodality (MM) thresholds. Time-dependent areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 554 men with prostate cancer and available CCR score from biopsy. The CCR score was prognostic for metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.32 [95% CI, 1.17 to 4.59]; P = .02), with scores above the MM threshold having a higher risk than those below the threshold (HR, 5.44 [95% CI, 2.72 to 10.91]; P < .001). The AUC for 3-year risk of metastasis on the basis of CCR was 0.736. When men with CCR above the MM threshold received MM therapy, their 3-year risk of metastasis was significantly lower than those receiving single-modality therapy (3% v 14%). Similarly, a CCR score above the active surveillance threshold portended a faster time to first definitive treatment. CONCLUSION: CCR outperforms other commonly used biomarkers for prediction of early metastasis. We illustrate the clinical utility of the CCR active surveillance and multimodality thresholds. Molecular genomic tests can inform patient selection and personalization of treatment for localized prostate cancer."
38328710,Reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy favors patients with tumors; however, only 3-26.3% of patients with cervical cancer benefit from single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been explored against tumor; however, the combination remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and the effects of platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in cervical cancer to identify the clinical value of combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy. METHODS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) with 11 markers (cluster of differentiation [CD]3, CD8, CD4, CD11c, CD68, forkhead box P3 [Foxp3], programmed cell death 1 [PD-1], programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 [PD-L1], indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO], cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [p16], and cytokeratin [CK]) was performed to evaluate TIME from 108 matched pre- and post-NACT cervical cancer samples. The mechanism of antitumor immunity triggered by NACT was explored using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from four paired samples and subsequently verified in 41 samples using IHC. RESULTS: The infiltration rate of the CD8(+) T cells in treatment-naive cervical cancer was 0.73%, and those of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and IDO(+) cells were 0.87% and 17.15%, respectively. Moreover, immunoreactive T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages were more in the stromal than the intratumor region. NACT increased dendritic, CD3(+) T, CD8(+) T, and CD4(+) T cells and decreased Tregs. The aforementioned alterations occurred predominantly in the stromal region and were primarily in responders. Non-responders primarily showed decreased Tregs and no increase in CD8(+) T or dendritic cell infiltration. Furthermore, dendritic cells interacted more closely with CD3(+) T cells after NACT, an effect primarily observed in responders. RNA-seq data revealed activation of the antigen receptor-mediated signaling pathway and upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and MHC II after chemotherapy, validated using IHC. CONCLUSIONS: NACT can reduce Tregs, and when tumor cells are effectively killed, antigen presentation is enhanced, subsequently activating antitumor immunity finitely. Our study provides the molecular characteristics and theoretical basis for the simultaneous or sequential combination of platinum-based NACT and immunotherapy for cervical cancer."
38328436,Unveiling diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cervical cancer: biomarker discovery through proteomics approaches and exploring the role of cervical cancer stem cells.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is a major global health problem and leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. Early detection through screening programs has reduced mortality; however, screening compliance remains low. Identifying non-invasive biomarkers through proteomics for diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment could improve patient outcomes. Here we review recent proteomics studies which have uncovered biomarkers and potential drug targets for CC. Additionally, we explore into the role of cervical cancer stem cells and their potential implications in driving CC progression and therapy resistance. Although challenges remain, proteomics has the potential to revolutionize the field of cervical cancer research and improve patient outcomes."
38328243,Blood-based screening for HPV-associated cancers.,"BACKGROUND: HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+OPSCC) is the most common HPV-associated cancer in the United States yet unlike cervical cancer lacks a screening test. HPV+OPSCCs are presumed to start developing 10-15 years prior to clinical diagnosis. Circulating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPVDNA) is a sensitive and specific biomarker for HPV+OPSCC. Taken together, blood-based screening for HPV+OPSCC may be feasible years prior to diagnosis. METHODS: We developed an HPV whole genome sequencing assay, HPV-DeepSeek, with 99% sensitivity and specificity at clinical diagnosis. 28 plasma samples from HPV+OPSCC patients collected 1.3-10.8 years prior to diagnosis along with 1:1 age and gender-matched controls were run on HPV-DeepSeek and an HPV serology assay. RESULTS: 22/28 (79%) of cases and 0/28 controls screened positive for HPV+OPSCC with 100% detection within four years of diagnosis and a maximum lead time of 7.8 years. We next applied a machine learning model classifying 27/28 cases (96%) with 100% detection within 10 years. Plasma-based PIK3CA gene mutations, viral genome integration events and HPV serology were used to orthogonally validate cancer detection with 68% (19/28) of the cohort having multiple cancer signals detected. Molecular fingerprinting of HPV genomes was performed across patients demonstrating that each viral genome was unique, ruling out contamination. In patients with tumor blocks from diagnosis (15/28), molecular fingerprinting was performed within patients confirming the same viral genome across time. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate accurate blood-based detection of HPV-associated cancers with lead times up to 10 years before clinical cancer diagnosis and in doing so, highlight the enormous potential of ctDNA-based cancer screening."
38327905,Exploring a novel seven-gene marker and mitochondrial gene TMEM38A for predicting cervical cancer radiotherapy sensitivity using machine learning algorithms.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy plays a crucial role in the management of Cervical cancer (CC), as the development of resistance by cancer cells to radiotherapeutic interventions is a significant factor contributing to treatment failure in patients. However, the specific mechanisms that contribute to this resistance remain unclear. Currently, molecular targeted therapy, including mitochondrial genes, has emerged as a new approach in treating different types of cancers, gaining significant attention as an area of research in addressing the challenge of radiotherapy resistance in cancer. METHODS: The present study employed a rigorous screening methodology within the TCGA database to identify a cohort of patients diagnosed with CC who had received radiotherapy treatment. The control group consisted of individuals who demonstrated disease stability or progression after undergoing radiotherapy. In contrast, the treatment group consisted of patients who experienced complete or partial remission following radiotherapy. Following this, we identified and examined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two cohorts. Subsequently, we conducted additional analyses to refine the set of excluded DEGs by employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and random forest techniques. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the potential correlation between the expression of core genes and the extent of immune cell infiltration in patients diagnosed with CC. The mitochondrial-associated genes were obtained from the MITOCARTA 3.0. Finally, the verification of increased expression of the mitochondrial gene TMEM38A in individuals with CC exhibiting sensitivity to radiotherapy was conducted using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry assays. RESULTS: This process ultimately led to the identification of 7 crucial genes, viz., GJA3, TMEM38A, ID4, CDHR1, SLC10A4, KCNG1, and HMGCS2, which were strongly associated with radiotherapy sensitivity. The enrichment analysis has unveiled a significant association between these 7 crucial genes and prominent signaling pathways, such as the p53 signaling pathway, KRAS signaling pathway, and PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway. By utilizing these 7 core genes, an unsupervised clustering analysis was conducted on patients with CC, resulting in the categorization of patients into three distinct molecular subtypes. In addition, a predictive model for the sensitivity of CC radiotherapy was developed using a neural network approach, utilizing the expression levels of these 7 core genes. Moreover, the CellMiner database was utilized to predict drugs that are closely linked to these 7 core genes, which could potentially act as crucial agents in overcoming radiotherapy resistance in CC. CONCLUSION: To summarize, the genes GJA3, TMEM38A, ID4, CDHR1, SLC10A4, KCNG1, and HMGCS2 were found to be closely correlated with the sensitivity of CC to radiotherapy. Notably, TMEM38A, a mitochondrial gene, exhibited the highest degree of correlation, indicating its potential as a crucial biomarker for the modulation of radiotherapy sensitivity in CC."
38327772,Circulating tumor DNA and tissue complementarily detect genomic alterations in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.,"The clinical utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) remains inadequately elucidated. This study presents the largest real-world cohort to conduct a concordance analysis between ctDNA and tissue-based genomic profiling in HSPC patients. The findings reveal diminished ctDNA abundance in cases with low tumor burden and demonstrate an increased concordance rate between ctDNA and tissue along with the progression of disease burden. Notably, a substantial number of exclusive genomic alterations (GAs) were identified either in ctDNA or tissue in high-volume metastatic disease. Integrating tissue and ctDNA analysis identified specific gene alterations (BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, TP53, PTEN, or RB1) associated with a shorter time to the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), with an escalated CRPC risk correlated with cumulative GAs. This multicenter, real-world investigation underscores the complementary role of ctDNA and tissue in detecting clinically pertinent GAs, highlighting their potential integration into clinical practice for advanced prostate cancer management."
38327652,Identification of Two Novel Pathogenic Variants of the ATM Gene in the Iranian-Azeri Turkish Ethnic Group by Applying Whole Exome Sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: The ATM gene encodes a multifunctional kinase involved in important cellular functions, such as checkpoint signaling and apoptosis, in response to DNA damage. Bi-allelic pathogenic variants in this gene cause Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), while carriers of ATM pathogenic variants are at increased risk of cancer depending on the pathogenicity of the variant they carry. Identifying pathogenic variants can aid in the management of the disease in carriers. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on three unrelated patients from the Iranian-Azeri Turkish ethnic group referred to a genetic center for analysis. WES was also conducted on 400 individuals from the same ethnic group to determine the frequencies of all ATM variants. Blood samples were collected from the patients and their family members for DNA extraction, and PCR-Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the WES results. RESULTS: The first proband with AT disease had two novel compound heterozygote variants (c.2639-2A>T, c.8708delC) in the ATM gene revealed by WES analysis, which was potentially/likely pathogenic. The second proband with bi-lateral breast cancer had a homozygous pathogenic variant (c.6067G>A) in the ATM gene identified by WES analysis. The third case with a family history of cancer had a heterozygous synonymous pathogenic variant (c.7788G>A) in the ATM gene found by WES analysis. Sanger sequencing confirmed the WES results, and bioinformatics analysis of the mutated ATM RNA and protein structure added evidence for the potential pathogenicity of the novel variants. WES analysis of the cohort revealed 38 different variants, including a variant (rs1800057, ATM:c.3161C>G, p.P1054R) associated with prostate cancer that had a higher frequency in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of three unrelated families with ATM-related disorders discovered two novel pathogenic variants. A homozygous missense pathogenic variant was identified in a woman with bi-lateral breast cancer, and a synonymous but pathogenic variant was found in a family with a history of different cancers."
38326539,Exploring the mechanism of action of Sparganii Rhizoma-Curcumae Rhizoma for in treating castration-resistant prostate cancer: a network-based pharmacology and experimental validation study.,"Sparganii Rhizoma-Curcumae Rhizoma (SR-CR) is a classic drug pair for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but its mechanism has not been clarified. The study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism of SR-CR in the management of CRPC. The present study employed the TCMSP as well as the SwissTargetPrediction platform to retrieve the chemical composition and targets of SR-CR. The therapeutic targets of CRPC were identified through screening the GeneCards, Disgenet, and OMIM databases. Subsequently, the Venny online platform was utilized to identify the shared targets between the SR-CR and CRPC. The shared targets were enrichment analysis using the Bioconductor and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases. The active ingredients and core targets were verified through molecular docking and were validated using PC3 cells in the experimental validation phase. A total of 7 active ingredients and 1126 disease targets were screened from SR-CR, leading to a total of 59 shared targets. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis resulted in 1309 GO entries. KEGG pathways analysis yielded 121 pathways, primarily involving cancer-related signaling pathways. The results from molecular docking revealed stable binding interactions between the core ingredients and the core targets. In vitro cellular assays further demonstrated that SR-CR effectively suppressed the activation of the Prostate cancer signaling pathway in PC3 cells, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. The SR-CR exert therapeutic effects on CRPC by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis through the Prostate cancer signaling pathway."
38324070,Spatial MS multiomics on clinical prostate cancer tissues.,"Mass spectrometry (MS) and MS imaging (MSI) are used extensively for both the spatial and bulk characterization of samples in lipidomics and proteomics workflows. These datasets are typically generated independently due to different requirements for sample preparation. However, modern omics technologies now provide higher sample throughput and deeper molecular coverage, which, in combination with more sophisticated bioinformatic and statistical pipelines, make generating multiomics data from a single sample a reality. In this workflow, we use spatial lipidomics data generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MSI (MALDI-MSI) on prostate cancer (PCa) radical prostatectomy cores to guide the definition of tumor and benign tissue regions for laser capture microdissection (LCM) and bottom-up proteomics all on the same sample and using the same mass spectrometer. Accurate region of interest (ROI) mapping was facilitated by the SCiLS region mapper software and dissected regions were analyzed using a dia-PASEF workflow. A total of 5525 unique protein groups were identified from all dissected regions. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), a lipid remodelling enzyme, was significantly enriched in the dissected regions of cancerous epithelium (CE) compared to benign epithelium (BE). The increased abundance of this protein was reflected in the lipidomics data with an increased ion intensity ratio for pairs of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) in CE compared to BE."
38323273,Identifying the role of MTHFD1L in prostate cancer progression from genetic analysis and experimental validation.,"One-carbon metabolism plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis as it supplies the one-carbon units necessary for nucleotide synthesis, epigenetic regulation, and redox metabolism, ensuring the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. However, their roles in prostate cancer progression remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the association between genetic variants in the one-carbon metabolism pathway and clinical outcomes in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. The associations of 130 single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within 14 genes involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway with cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival, and progression-free survival were assessed using Cox regression in 630 patients with prostate cancer. Subsequently, functional studies were performed using prostate cancer cell lines. After adjusting for covariates and multiple testing, MTHFD1L rs2073190 was found to be significantly associated with CSS (P = 0.000184). Further pooled analysis of multiple datasets demonstrated that MTHFD1L was upregulated in prostate cancer and increased MTHFD1L expression was positively correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis. Functionally, MTHFD1L knockdown suppressed prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation. RNA sequencing and pathway analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were predominantly enriched in the cell cycle pathway. In conclusion, genetic variants in MTHFD1L of one-carbon metabolism may serve as promising predictors, and our findings offer valuable insights into the underlying genetic mechanisms of prostate cancer progression."
38322554,The deubiquitinase OTUB2 promotes cervical cancer growth through stabilizing FOXM1.,"OBJECTIVES: Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein Otubain2 (OTUB2) is an important cysteine protease with deubiquitinase activity in the OTU family. However, the role of OTUB2 in cervical cancer (CC) has not been investigated. METHODS: OTUB2 expression was analyzed employing the CC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis were performed to identify OTUB2 expression in CC. The oncogenic function of OTUB2 was identified through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Tandem Mass Tag Quantitative Proteomics examination was used to identify potential targets of OTUB2. RESULTS: OTUB2 was overexpressed in CC and was related to poor prognosis of patients. In our in-house cohort, we also showed that OTUB2 was overexpressed in tumor tissues of CC compared to para-tumor. Knockdown of OTUB2 suppressed CC cell growth whereas OTUB2 upregulation fostered the proliferation of cancer cells. Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was found to be a target of OTUB2. FOXM1 can be positively regulated by OTUB2 in CC cells. In human CC tissues, protein level of FOXM1 was positively correlated with OTUB2. FOXM1 was found to play a critical role in OTUB2-mediated CC cell growth. Mechanistically, OTUB2 could bind FOXM1 and deubiquitinate FOXM1 to stabilize it. CONCLUSION: OTUB2 promotes CC progression through deubiquitinating and stabilizing FOXM1."
38322491,Whole transcriptome profiling of placental pathobiology in SARS-CoV-2 pregnancies identifies placental dysfunction signatures.,"OBJECTIVES: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection in pregnancy is associated with higher incidence of placental dysfunction, referred to by a few studies as a 'preeclampsia-like syndrome'. However, the mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2-induced placental malfunction are still unclear. Here, we investigated whether the transcriptional architecture of the placenta is altered in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We utilised whole-transcriptome, digital spatial profiling, to examine gene expression patterns in placental tissues from participants who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester of their pregnancy (n = 7) and those collected prior to the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (n = 9). RESULTS: Through comprehensive spatial transcriptomic analyses of the trophoblast and villous core stromal cell subpopulations in the placenta, we identified SARS-CoV-2 to promote signatures associated with hypoxia and placental dysfunction. Notably, genes associated with vasodilation (NOS3), oxidative stress (GDF15, CRH) and preeclampsia (FLT1, EGFR, KISS1, PAPPA2) were enriched with SARS-CoV-2. Pathways related to increased nutrient uptake, vascular tension, hypertension and inflammation were also enriched in SARS-CoV-2 samples compared to uninfected controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the utility of spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis in defining the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, particularly its role in placental dysfunction. Furthermore, this study highlights the significance of digital spatial profiling in mapping the intricate crosstalk between trophoblasts and villous core stromal cells, thus shedding light on pathways associated with placental dysfunction in pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
38320439,Overcoming chemoresistance and radio resistance in prostate cancer: The emergent role of non-coding RNAs.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to be a major health concern worldwide, with its resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy presenting major hurdles in successful treatment. While patients with localized prostate cancer generally have a good survival rate, those with metastatic prostate cancer often face a grim prognosis, even with aggressive treatments using various methods. The high mortality rate in severe cases is largely due to the lack of treatment options that can offer lasting results, especially considering the significant genetic diversity found in tumors at the genomic level. This comprehensive review examines the intricate molecular mechanisms governing resistance in PCa, emphasising the pivotal contributions of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We delve into the diverse roles of microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and other non-coding elements as critical regulators of key cellular processes involved in CR & RR. The review emphasizes the diagnostic potential of ncRNAs as predictive biomarkers for treatment response, offering insights into patient stratification and personalized therapeutic approaches. Additionally, we explore the therapeutic implications of targeting ncRNAs to overcome CR & RR, highlighting innovative strategies to restore treatment sensitivity. By synthesizing current knowledge, this review not only provides a comprehension of the chemical basis of resistance in PCa but also identifies gaps in knowledge, paving the way for future research directions. Ultimately, this exploration of ncRNA perspectives offers a roadmap for advancing precision medicine in PCa, potentially transforming therapeutic paradigms and improving outcomes for patients facing the challenges of treatment resistance."
38318136,Dual inhibition of MEK and PI3Kbeta/delta-a potential therapeutic strategy in PTEN-wild-type docetaxel-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.,"Background: Docetaxel remains the standard treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, resistance frequently emerges as a result of hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT and the MEK/ERK pathways. Therefore, the inhibition of these pathways presents a potential therapeutic approach. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of simultaneous inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways in docetaxel-resistant mCRPC, both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant mCRPC cells were treated with selumetinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor), AZD8186 (PI3Kbeta/delta inhibitor) and capivasertib (pan-AKT inhibitor) alone and in combination. Efficacy and toxicity of selumetinib+AZD8186 were tested in docetaxel-resistant xenograft mice. CRISPR-Cas9 generated a PTEN-knockdown docetaxel-resistant cell model. Changes in phosphorylation of AKT, ERK and downstream targets were analyzed by Western blot. Antiapoptotic adaptations after treatments were detected by dynamic BH3 profiling. Results: PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways were hyperactivated in PTEN-wild-type (wt) docetaxel-resistant cells. Selumetinib+AZD8186 decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in PTEN-wt docetaxel-resistant cells. This observation was further confirmed in vivo, where docetaxel-resistant xenograft mice treated with selumetinib+AZD8186 exhibited reduced tumor growth without additional toxicity. Conclusion: Our findings on the activity of selumetinib+AZD8186 in PTEN-wt cells and in docetaxel-resistant xenograft mice provide an excellent rationale for a novel therapeutic strategy for PTEN-wt mCRPC patients resistant to docetaxel, in whom, unlike PTEN-loss patients, a clinical benefit of treatment with single-agent PI3K and AKT inhibitors has not been demonstrated. A phase I-II trial of this promising combination is warranted."
38312824,Single nucleotide polymorphism within chromosome 8q24 is associated with prostate cancer development in Saudi Arabia.,"OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are important risk factors for the development of prostate cancer (PCa). Preliminary studies have suggested that the incidence of PCa in Saudi males is low but is probably familial or genetically related. METHODS: To identify any possible association of SNP with PCa development in Saudi patients, we investigated a group of SNPs in Saudi PCa patients (n=85) and compared the outcomes to healthy normal controls (n=115) and nodular hyperplasia patients (n=120). DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue or whole blood from both patients' groups and healthy control group. A total of thirteen SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan(R) minor groove binder polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: The rs16901979A, s629242T and rs1447295A alleles were found at significantly higher frequency in PCa patients than controls (p<0.05). The rs16901979 CA genotype was found at significantly greater frequency in PCa patients than in healthy controls (43% vs. 14%, odds ratio=4.6, p=0.0001) and benign hyperplasia group (43% vs. 25%, odds ratio=2.2, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Our study has highlighted the association of rs16901979 SNP with PCa in Saudi males. Such findings have important implications in the PCa diagnosis and in screening unaffected family members of Saudi patients."
38311373,Repeated Injections of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Ameliorate Erectile Dysfunction in a Cavernous Nerve Injury Rat Model.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of repeated injections of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes on the erectile dysfunction (ED) of bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) rat model and to identify potential target genes of these injections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSC-derived exosomes were isolated using an aqueous two-phase system. Rats were randomly assigned into four groups: Normal, BCNI, exosome once, and exosome-repeat groups. After four weeks, we measured the intracavernosal pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio to evaluate erectile function and examined cavernous nerve tissues for histological and molecular analyses. RNA sequencing in penile tissues was used to determine differentially expressed genes and was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used for in vitro studies to analyze biological roles. RESULTS: The ICP/MAP ratios in the exosome-once and exosome-repeat groups were significantly increased compared to those in the BCNI group. Interestingly, the ICP/MAP ratio showed a greater increase in the exosome-repeat group, which also showed significantly increased smooth muscle/collagen ratio, alpha-smooth muscle actin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate level compared to the BCNI and exosome-once groups. Three genes were significantly differentially expressed in the exosome group, among which Ras homolog family member B promoted cell proliferation and angiogenesis of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated injections of MSC-derived exosomes can be effective in the treatment of rat models with ED induced by cavernous nerve injury."
38310103,ANKRD1 is a mesenchymal-specific driver of cancer-associated fibroblast activation bridging androgen receptor loss to AP-1 activation.,"There are significant commonalities among several pathologies involving fibroblasts, ranging from auto-immune diseases to fibrosis and cancer. Early steps in cancer development and progression are closely linked to fibroblast senescence and transformation into tumor-promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), suppressed by the androgen receptor (AR). Here, we identify ANKRD1 as a mesenchymal-specific transcriptional coregulator under direct AR negative control in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and a key driver of CAF conversion, independent of cellular senescence. ANKRD1 expression in CAFs is associated with poor survival in HNSCC, lung, and cervical SCC patients, and controls a specific gene expression program of myofibroblast CAFs (my-CAFs). ANKRD1 binds to the regulatory region of my-CAF effector genes in concert with AP-1 transcription factors, and promotes c-JUN and FOS association. Targeting ANKRD1 disrupts AP-1 complex formation, reverses CAF activation, and blocks the pro-tumorigenic properties of CAFs in an orthotopic skin cancer model. ANKRD1 thus represents a target for fibroblast-directed therapy in cancer and potentially beyond."
38309723,Comprehensive multiplexed autoantibody profiling of patients with advanced urothelial cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive profiling of autoantibodies (AAbs) in metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) has not been performed to date. This may aid in diagnosis of UC, uncover novel therapeutic targets in this disease as well as identify associations between AAbs and response and toxicity to systemic therapies. METHODS: We used serum from patients with mUC collected prior to and after systemic therapy (immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) or platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC)) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 38 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) from healthy blood donors were also evaluated. The SeroTag immuno-oncology discovery array (Oncimmune) was used, with quantification of the AAb reactivity toward 1132 antigens. Bound AAbs were detected using an anti-immunoglobulin G-specific detection antibody conjugated to the fluorescent reporter dye phycoerythrin. The AAb reactivity was reported as the median fluorescence intensity for each color and sample using a Luminex FlexMAP3D analyzer. Clinical outcomes of interest included radiographic response and development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Significance analysis of microarray was used to compare mUC versus HC and radiographic response. Associations with irAE were evaluated using a logistic regression model. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 66 patients were included with a median age of 68 years; 54 patients (82%) received ICI and 12 patients (18%) received PBC. Compared with HCs, AAbs against the cancer/testis antigens (CTAG1B, CTAG2, MAGEB18), HSPA1A, TP53, KRAS, and FGFR3 were significantly elevated in patients with mUC. AAbs against BRCA2, TP53, and CTNBB1 were associated with response, and those against BICD2 and UACA were associated with resistance to ICI therapy. AAbs against MITF, CDH3, and KDM4A were associated with development of irAEs in patient who received an ICI. A higher variance in pre-to-post treatment fold change in AAb levels was seen in patients treated with ICI versus PBC and was associated with response to ICI. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of comprehensive AAb profiling of patients with mUC and identified key AAbs that were elevated in patients with mUC versus HCs as well as AAbs associated with therapeutic response to ICI. These findings are hypothesis generating and further mechanistic studies evaluating humoral immunity in UC are required."
38307951,The yin and yang of chromosomal instability in prostate cancer.,"Metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable lethal disease. Studies indicate that prostate cancer accumulates genomic changes during disease progression and displays the highest levels of chromosomal instability (CIN) across all types of metastatic tumours. CIN, which refers to ongoing chromosomal DNA gain or loss during mitosis, and derived aneuploidy, are known to be associated with increased tumour heterogeneity, metastasis and therapy resistance in many tumour types. Paradoxically, high CIN levels are also proposed to be detrimental to tumour cell survival, suggesting that cancer cells must develop adaptive mechanisms to ensure their survival. In the context of prostate cancer, studies indicate that CIN has a key role in disease progression and might also offer a therapeutic vulnerability that can be pharmacologically targeted. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the causes and consequences of CIN in prostate cancer, its contribution to aggressive advanced disease and a better understanding of the acquired CIN tolerance mechanisms can translate into new tumour classifications, biomarker development and therapeutic strategies."
38307556,Copy Number Gain in Androgen Receptors Predicts the Poor Prognosis in Japanese Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The prognostic significance of androgen receptor amplification (AR amp) in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was studied in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 serum samples were obtained from 38 patients with CRPC. Serum cfDNA was purified and the AR copy number was determined. Factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were statistically investigated. RESULTS: The number of patients administered enzalutamide (Enza)/abiraterone (Abi)/docetaxel (DTX) was 33/25/11, respectively. The median PSA was 16.5 ng/ml. Thirty patients (79%) had bone metastases and three patients (7.9%) had lung metastases. The median follow-up was 655 days. The median initial AR copy number was 1.27 (1.10-11.50); an AR copy number of 1.27 or higher was defined as an AR-amp. Regarding PFS, the presence of AR-amp, Gleason score (GS), and ALP were significant factors in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, AR amplification was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio=7.7, p=0.0035). For OS, PSA and AR-amp were significant factors. In multivariate analysis, AR-amp (hazard ratio=4.65, p=0.0188) was the only independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: AR-amp was associated with high nadir PSA and low iPSA/PSA ratio. AR-amp was significantly associated with poor prognosis in Japanese patients with CRPC."
38307027,Insights into the mechanisms and structure of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles in cervical cancer using long-read sequencing.,"Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, has few approved targeted therapeutics, and is the most common cause of cancer death in low-resource countries. We characterized 19 cervical and four head and neck cancer cell lines using long-read DNA and RNA sequencing and identified the HPV types, HPV integration sites, chromosomal alterations, and cancer driver mutations. Structural variation analysis revealed telomeric deletions associated with DNA inversions resulting from breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. BFB is a common mechanism of chromosomal alterations in cancer, and our study applies long-read sequencing to this important chromosomal rearrangement type. Analysis of the inversion sites revealed staggered ends consistent with exonuclease digestion of the DNA after breakage. Some BFB events are complex, involving inter- or intra-chromosomal insertions or rearrangements. None of the BFB breakpoints had telomere sequences added to resolve the dicentric chromosomes, and only one BFB breakpoint showed chromothripsis. Five cell lines have a chromosomal region 11q BFB event, with YAP1-BIRC3-BIRC2 amplification. Indeed, YAP1 amplification is associated with a 10-year-earlier age of diagnosis of cervical cancer and is three times more common in African American women. This suggests that individuals with cervical cancer and YAP1-BIRC3-BIRC2 amplification, especially those of African ancestry, might benefit from targeted therapy. In summary, we uncovered valuable insights into the mechanisms and consequences of BFB cycles in cervical cancer using long-read sequencing."
38306566,The potential mechanism of Guizhi Fuling Wan effect in the treatment of cervical squamous cell carcinoma: A bioinformatics analysis investigation.,"As a global malignancy with high mortality rate, targeted drug development for Uterine Cervical Neoplasms is an important direction. The traditional formula Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW) is widely used in gynecological diseases. However, its potential mechanism of action remains to be discovered. We retrieved GFW and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) targets from public databases. The protein-protein interaction network was obtained by string computational analysis and imported Cytoscape_v3.9.0 to obtain the core network and the top 10 Hub genes. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were used for enrichment analysis of the core network, and then molecular docking to verify whether the selected signaling pathway binds well to the core node. Finally, clinical prognostic analysis and expression differences of Hub genes were validated using the Cancer Genome Atlas database and R language. Our search yielded 152 common targets for GFW and CSCC. The interleukin-17 signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, and Toll-like signaling pathway were then selected for further molecular docking from the hub genes enrichment analysis results, which showed good binding. Among the Hub genes, JUN, VEGFA, IL1B, and EGF had a poor prognosis for CSCC. In conclusion, this study illustrates that GFW can have adjuvant therapeutic effects on CSCC through multiple targets and multiple pathways, providing a basis for further research."
38306015,ERBB3 Overexpression is Enriched in Diverse Patient Populations with Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer and is Associated with a Unique AR Activity Signature.,"PURPOSE: Despite successful clinical management of castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC), the 5-year survival rate for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer is only 32%. Combination treatment strategies to prevent disease recurrence are increasing, albeit in biomarker-unselected patients. Identifying a biomarker in CSPC to stratify patients who will progress on standard-of-care therapy could guide therapeutic strategies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Targeted deep sequencing was performed for the University of Illinois (UI) cohort (n = 30), and immunostaining was performed on a patient tissue microarray (n = 149). Bioinformatic analyses identified pathways associated with biomarker overexpression (OE) in the UI cohort, consolidated RNA sequencing samples accessed from Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (n = 664), and GSE209954 (n = 68). Neutralizing antibody patritumab and ectopic HER3 OE were utilized for functional mechanistic experiments. RESULTS: We identified ERBB3 OE in diverse patient populations with CSPC, where it was associated with advanced disease at diagnosis. Bioinformatic analyses showed a positive correlation between ERBB3 expression and the androgen response pathway despite low dihydrotestosterone and stable expression of androgen receptor (AR) transcript in Black/African American men. At the protein level, HER3 expression was negatively correlated with intraprostatic androgen in Black/African American men. Mechanistically, HER3 promoted enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cell line models and HER3-targeted therapy resensitized therapy-resistant prostate cancer cell lines to enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: In diverse patient populations with CSPC, ERBB3 OE was associated with high AR signaling despite low intraprostatic androgen. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a direct link between HER3 and enzalutamide resistance. ERBB3 OE as a biomarker could thus stratify patients for intensification of therapy in castration-sensitive disease, including targeting HER3 directly to improve sensitivity to AR-targeted therapies."
38305663,Real-world data on the comprehensive genetic profiling test for Japanese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: comprehensive genomic profiling test has been covered by Japanese health insurance since June 2019. However, no real-world data on the test have been reported with a focus on Japanese patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: we retrospectively reviewed the data of 45 consecutive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who underwent the comprehensive genomic profiling tests at Kitasato University Hospital between August 2019 and December 2022. Patients' characteristics, prevalence of gene alterations and therapeutic impact of genotype-matched therapy were assessed. RESULTS: genomic data were obtained using a tissue-based test (n = 32) and liquid-based test (n = 13). Actionable genomic alternations were identified in 51.1% of patients, and 22.2% were treated with genotype-matched therapy. The main reason for not receiving genotype-matched therapy was disease progression, accounting for 46.2% (6/13). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly longer overall survival after the comprehensive genomic profiling tests in patients with genotype-matched therapy under public insurance (17.8%, n = 8) than those without it (median: not reached vs. 18.1 months; P = 0.003). Five (62.5%) out of the eight patients with genotype-matched therapy under public insurance had BRCA1 or 2 deleterious alteration. Multivariate analyses showed that BRCA deleterious alteration (17.8%, n = 8) was an independent risk factor for shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (hazard ratio: 2.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-5.87; P = 0.041), and no patients with the alteration had </=5 bone metastases. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study showed the promising survival outcomes in patients with genotype-matched therapy under public insurance, even in the castration-resistant prostate cancer setting. Further detection of promising therapeutic target gene is expected to increase the number of patients who reach genotype-matched therapies."
38304339,Historical evolution of cancer genomics research in Latin America: a comprehensive visual and bibliometric analysis until 2023.,"Background: Cancer genomics, as an interdisciplinary research area within the Global Cancer Research agenda, genomics and precision medicine, its important in research and clinical practice in Latin America. To date, there has been no study investigating evolution of this area in this region. The aim of this study was to evaluate for first time, the historical evolution of cancer genomics research in Latin America. Methods: Bibliometric cross-sectional study of documents on cancer genomics published by Latin American authors until 2023 in Scopus was performed. Statistical and visual analysis was performed with R programming language. Results: A total of 1534 documents were obtained. The first document of cancer genomics research was published in 1997, marking the inception of a 26-year evaluation period that extended until 2023. Among the documents, 74.3% (n = 1140) constituted original articles, followed by 22.7% (n = 349) classified as reviews. International collaboration was observed in 6.5% (n = 100) of the articles. Within the compilation of the ten most prolific authors in this region, 90% of them are from Brazil. This observed pattern extends to affiliations as well, wherein the Universidade de Sao Paulo emerges as the most active institution (n = 255 documents). This arrangement firmly establishes Brazil's prominence as the preeminent country in the region concerning cancer genomics research, showcasing robust collaboration networks both regionally and intercontinentally. An important transition in the studied hot topics over the last 20 years was identified, from the exploration of the human genome and the characterization of genomic and proteomic cancer profiles (1997-2010) to an in-depth investigation of cancer stem cells and personalized medicine (2011-2023). Among the array of cancer types under study, predominant attention has been directed towards breast, lung, prostate, and leukemia. Conclusion: Over the course of the past 26 years, a favorable and notable evolution has characterized cancer genomics research within Latin America, with Brazil leading the way, which possess a robust network of regional and intercontinental collaboration. Furthermore, the lines of research and hot topics have change in harmony with the region's objectives, strategies, and requisites."
38302875,A reliable transcriptomic risk-score applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies improves outcome prediction in localized prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestation of prostate cancer (PCa) is highly variable. Aggressive tumors require radical treatment while clinically non-significant ones may be suitable for active surveillance. We previously developed the prognostic ProstaTrend RNA signature based on transcriptome-wide microarray and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses, primarily of prostatectomy specimens. An RNA-Seq study of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies has now allowed us to use this test as a basis for the development of a novel test that is applicable to FFPE biopsies as a tool for early routine PCa diagnostics. METHODS: All patients of the FFPE biopsy cohort were treated by radical prostatectomy and median follow-up for biochemical recurrence (BCR) was 9 years. Based on the transcriptome data of 176 FFPE biopsies, we filtered ProstaTrend for genes susceptible to FFPE-associated degradation via regression analysis. ProstaTrend was additionally restricted to genes with concordant prognostic effects in the RNA-Seq TCGA prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cohort to ensure robust and broad applicability. The prognostic relevance of the refined Transcriptomic Risk Score (TRS) was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox-regression models in our FFPE-biopsy cohort and 9 other public datasets from PCa patients with BCR as primary endpoint. In addition, we developed a prostate single-cell atlas of 41 PCa patients from 5 publicly available studies to analyze gene expression of ProstaTrend genes in different cell compartments. RESULTS: Validation of the TRS using the original ProstaTrend signature in the cohort of FFPE biopsies revealed a relevant impact of FFPE-associated degradation on gene expression and consequently no significant association with prognosis (Cox-regression, p-value > 0.05) in FFPE tissue. However, the TRS based on the new version of the ProstaTrend-ffpe signature, which included 204 genes (of originally 1396 genes), was significantly associated with BCR in the FFPE biopsy cohort (Cox-regression p-value < 0.001) and retained prognostic relevance when adjusted for Gleason Grade Groups. We confirmed a significant association with BCR in 9 independent cohorts including 1109 patients. Comparison of the prognostic performance of the TRS with 17 other prognostically relevant PCa panels revealed that ProstaTrend-ffpe was among the best-ranked panels. We generated a PCa cell atlas to associate ProstaTrend genes with cell lineages or cell types. Tumor-specific luminal cells have a significantly higher TRS than normal luminal cells in all analyzed datasets. In addition, TRS of epithelial and luminal cells was correlated with increased Gleason score in 3 studies. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a prognostic gene-expression signature for PCa that can be applied to FFPE biopsies and may be suitable to support clinical decision-making."
38302551,A prospective clinical trial of diathermy ablation for patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia from a single institution in Japan.,"Approximately 500,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer annually, with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) estimated to be 20 times higher. The diathermy ablation is an inexpensive minimally invasive surgeries for CIN. However, little is known about the treatment outcomes. A prospective clinical trial was therefore conducted to evaluate ablation outcomes based on detailed colposcopy findings, cytology, and biopsy results over a two-year period. We enrolled CIN2 (n = 32) and CIN3 (n = 7) patients. Eligibility criteria included: aged between 29 and 49 (median: 36, mean: 36.3), visible transformation zone with high-grade lesions not entirely occupying the cervix, and histologically diagnosed with CIN2 or CIN3. Cytology and HPV genotyping were performed, and colposcopic findings were evaluated. Colposcopy-guided diathermy ablation was conducted by a certified gynecologic oncologist. The incidence of recurrent or residual disease was 5.1% (2/39, 95% confidence interval: - 0.02 to 0.12). The prevalence of HPV infection at 12 months decreased after surgery, as 67.6% (23/34, 0.52-0.83) of patients were HPV-negative. No severe adverse events were reported, while there were five pregnancies with full-term deliveries. The promising outcome was possibly due to selection of rigorous surgical indication and skilled surgical techniques. The study highlights the importance of experienced and skilled colposcopists.TrialRegistry This study was registered in the clinical trial registration system of the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR ID: UMIN000024483). Open for the trial to the public through the website: 01/11/2016. First registration of the patient: 30/01/2017."
38300720,"A Phase I Study of Acapatamab, a Half-life Extended, PSMA-Targeting Bispecific T-cell Engager for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.","PURPOSE: Safety and efficacy of acapatamab, a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) x CD3 bispecific T-cell engager were evaluated in a first-in-human study in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with mCRPC refractory to androgen receptor pathway inhibitor therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy received target acapatamab doses ranging from 0.003 to 0.9 mg in dose exploration (seven dose levels) and 0.3 mg (recommended phase II dose) in dose expansion intravenously every 2 weeks. Safety (primary objective), pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity (secondary objectives) were assessed. RESULTS: In all, 133 patients (dose exploration, n = 77; dose expansion, n = 56) received acapatamab. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event seen in 97.4% and 98.2% of patients in dose exploration and dose expansion, respectively; grade >/= 3 was seen in 23.4% and 16.1%, respectively. Most CRS events were seen in treatment cycle 1; incidence and severity decreased at/beyond cycle 2. In dose expansion, confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses (PSA50) were seen in 30.4% of patients and radiographic partial responses in 7.4% (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1). Median PSA progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-4.9], radiographic PFS per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.0-5.4). Acapatamab induced T-cell activation and increased cytokine production several-fold within 24 hours of initiation. Treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies were detected in 55% and impacted serum exposures in 36% of patients in dose expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Acapatamab was safe and tolerated and had a manageable CRS profile. Preliminary signs of efficacy with limited durable antitumor activity were observed. Acapatamab demonstrated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity."
38299254,Inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 6 activates interferon signaling and induces the apoptosis of endometrial cancer cells via histone modification.,"Histone modification, a major epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling, introduces dynamic changes in chromatin architecture. Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including prostate, lung and endometrial cancer (EC). Epigenome regulates the expression of endogenous retrovirus (ERV), which activates interferon signaling related to cancer. The antitumor effects of PRMT6 inhibition and the role of PRMT6 in EC were investigated, using epigenome multi‑omics analysis, including an assay for chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP‑seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA‑seq). The expression of PRMT6 in EC was analyzed using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic impact of PRMT6 expression was evaluated using IHC. The effects of PRMT6‑knockdown (KD) were investigated using cell viability and apoptosis assays, as well as its effects on the epigenome, using ChIP‑seq of H3K27ac antibodies and RNA‑seq. Finally, the downstream targets identified by multi‑omics analysis were evaluated. PRMT6 was overexpressed in EC and associated with a poor prognosis. PRMT6‑KD induced histone hypomethylation, while suppressing cell growth and apoptosis. ChIP‑seq revealed that PRMT6 regulated genomic regions related to interferons and apoptosis through histone modifications. The RNA‑seq data demonstrated altered interferon‑related pathways and increased expression of tumor suppressor genes, including NK6 homeobox 1 and phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase regulatory subunit 1, following PRMT6‑KD. RT‑qPCR revealed that eight ERV genes which activated interferon signaling were upregulated by PRMT6‑KD. The data of the present study suggested that PRMT6 inhibition induced apoptosis through interferon signaling activated by ERV. PRMT6 regulated tumor suppressor genes and may be a novel therapeutic target, to the best of our knowledge, in EC."
38298716,"HIF-1A as a prognostic biomarker related to invasion, migration and immunosuppression of cervical cancer.","BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer ranks second among malignant tumors in women, exerting a significant impact on their quality of life and overall well-being. The hypoxic microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis. The present study aims to investigate the fundamental genes and pathways associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1A) in cervical cancer, aiming to identify potential downstream targets for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. METHODS: We obtained dataset GSE63514 from the Comprehensive Gene Expression Database (GEO). The dataset comprised of 24 patients in the normal group and 28 patients in the tumor group. Gene set difference analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to identify the genes related to HIF-1A expression and the specific signaling pathways involved.The association between HIF-1A and tumor immune infiltration was examined in the TCGA dataset. The WGCAN network was constructed to identify key genes within the blue module, and subsequent gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to determine the pathways and functional annotations associated with HIF-1A. The protein interaction network of the HIF-1A gene was obtained from the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape in the meantime.The function of HIF-1A and its related gene expression were verified in vivo. RESULTS: HIF-1A was a risk factor in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of cervical cancer patients. A total of 344 genes significantly correlated with the expression of HIF-1A were identified through correlation analysis, and the genes exhibiting the strongest correlation were obtained. The major signaling pathways involved in HIF-1A encompass TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, TGF-beta, JAK-STAT, and various other signaling cascades. Reinforced by qRT-PCR, we identified Integrin beta-1 (ITGB1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), striatin 3 (STRN3), and endothelin-1 (EDN1) as pivotal downstream genes influenced by HIF-1A. HIF-1A is associated with immune infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, CD4(+)T cells, M0 macrophages, neutrophils, follicular helper T cells, CD8(+)T cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg). HIF-1A is associated with sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. The identification of the HIF-1A pathway and its function primarily focuses on cytoplasmic translation, aerobic respiration, cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, among others. The results of in vivo experiments have confirmed that HIF-1A plays a crucial role in promoting the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Moreover, the overexpression of HIF-1A led to an upregulation in the expressions of ITGB1, CCL2, STRN3, and EDN1. CONCLUSIONS: The role of HIF-1A in cervical cancer was determined through a combination of bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. The genes potentially implicated in the tumorigenesis mechanism of HIF-1A were identified. These findings has the potential to enhance our comprehension of the progression of cervical cancer and offer promising therapeutic targets for its clinical management."
38298693,NUPR1 contributes to activate TFE3-dependent autophagy leading to cervical cancer proliferation.,"Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cervix of women and endangers their lives. In this study, we aimed to assess the roles of NUPR1 and TFE3 in cervical cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to assess the correlation between NUPR1 and TFE3 expression in cervical cancer. By silencing NUPR1 and TFE3, and through 3-MA treatment, we determined whether their silencing could lead to lysosomal dysfunction, thereby inhibiting autophagy and cervical cancer cell proliferation. Their roles were further analyzed using molecular biological methods. Silencing NUPR1 and TFE3 inhibited cell proliferation and decreased the expression levels of autophagy-related genes, p62 and LC3B. By tracing lysosomes within cells, NUPR1 and TFE3 knockdown were found to induce lysosomal dysfunction, thereby inhibiting autophagy. In vivo experimental studies have shown that knockdown of NUPR1 and TFE3 can inhibit tumor growth, while reducing the ki67, p62, and LC3B expression levels and promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, the expression levels of lamp1 and lamp2, and the phosphorylation of PI3K (p-PI3K) and Akt (p-Akt) were significantly reduced after NUPR1 and TFE3 knockdown. However, treatment with 3-MA and overexpression of TFE3 could partially reverse the effect of silencing NUPR1. Overall, silencing NUPR1 reduced autophagy by inhibiting TFE3 in cervical cancer. Our results supply new evidence for the use of NUPR1 as a therapeutic target in cervical cancer."
38298438,Predicting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and determining the follow-up period in high-risk human papillomavirus patients.,"PURPOSE: Despite strong efforts to promote human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and cervical cancer screening, cervical cancer remains a threat to women's reproductive health. Some high-risk HPV types play a crucial role in the progression of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. Therefore, HPV screening has become an important means to prevent, diagnose, and triage cervical cancer. This study aims to leverage artificial intelligence to predict individual risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women with high-risk HPV infection and to recommend the appropriate triage strategy and follow-up period according to the risk level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 475 cases were collected in this study. The sources were from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in a tertiary hospital, a case report on HPV from the PubMed website, and clinical data of cervical cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Through in-depth study of the interaction between high-risk HPV and its risk factors, the risk factor relationship diagram structure was constructed. A Classification of Lesion Stages (CLS) algorithm was designed to predict cervical lesion stages. The risk levels of patients were analyzed based on all risk factors, and follow-up periods were formulated for each risk level. RESULTS: Our proposed CLS algorithm predicted the probability of occurrence of CIN3-the precancerous lesion stage of cervical cancer. This prediction was based on patients' HPV-16 and -18 infection status, age, presence of persistent infection, and HPV type. Follow-up periods of 3-6 months, 6-12 months, and 3- to 5-year intervals were suggested for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: A lesion prediction model was constructed to determine the probabilities of occurrence of CIN by analyzing individual data, such as patient lifestyle, physical assessments, and patient complaints, in order to identify high-risk patients. Furthermore, the potential implications of the calculated features were mined to devise prevention strategies."
38297981,"First-In-Human Phase I Study of Tinengotinib (TT-00420), a Multiple Kinase Inhibitor, as a Single Agent in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.","PURPOSE: This first-in-human phase I dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of tinengotinib (TT-00420), a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-3 (FGFRs 1-3), Janus kinase 1/2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and Aurora A/B, in patients with advanced solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received tinengotinib orally daily in 28-day cycles. Dose escalation was guided by Bayesian modeling using escalation with overdose control. The primary objective was to assess dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and dose recommended for dose expansion (DRDE). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics and efficacy. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled (dose escalation, n = 40; dose expansion, n = 8). MTD was not reached; DRDE was 12 mg daily. DLTs were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (8 mg, n = 1) and hypertension (15 mg, n = 2). The most common treatment-related adverse event was hypertension (50.0%). In 43 response-evaluable patients, 13 (30.2%) achieved partial response (PR; n = 7) or stable disease (SD) >/= 24 weeks (n = 6), including 4/11 (36.4%) with FGFR2 mutations/fusions and cholangiocarcinoma (PR n = 3; SD >/= 24 weeks n = 1), 3/3 (100.0%) with hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer (PR n = 2; SD >/= 24 weeks n = 1), 2/5 (40.0%) with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; PR n = 1; SD >/= 24 weeks n = 1), and 1/1 (100.0%) with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; PR). Four of 12 patients (33.3%; HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, TNBC, prostate cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma) treated at DRDE had PRs. Tinengotinib's half-life was 28-34 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Tinengotinib was well tolerated with favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Preliminary findings indicated potential clinical benefit in FGFR inhibitor-refractory cholangiocarcinoma, HER2-negative breast cancer (including TNBC), and CRPC. Continued evaluation of tinengotinib is warranted in phase II trials."
38295147,Cerebrospinal Fluid cfDNA Sequencing for Classification of Central Nervous System Glioma.,"PURPOSE: Primary central nervous system (CNS) gliomas can be classified by characteristic genetic alterations. In addition to solid tissue obtained via surgery or biopsy, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an alternative source of material for genomic analyses. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing of CSF cfDNA in a representative cohort of 85 patients presenting at two neurooncological centers with suspicion of primary or recurrent glioma. Copy-number variation (CNV) profiles, single-nucleotide variants (SNV), and small insertions/deletions (indel) were combined into a molecular-guided tumor classification. Comparison with the solid tumor was performed for 38 cases with matching solid tissue available. RESULTS: Cases were stratified into four groups: glioblastoma (n = 32), other glioma (n = 19), nonmalignant (n = 17), and nondiagnostic (n = 17). We introduced a molecular-guided tumor classification, which enabled identification of tumor entities and/or cancer-specific alterations in 75.0% (n = 24) of glioblastoma and 52.6% (n = 10) of other glioma cases. The overlap between CSF and matching solid tissue was highest for CNVs (26%-48%) and SNVs at predefined gene loci (44%), followed by SNVs/indels identified via uninformed variant calling (8%-14%). A molecular-guided tumor classification was possible for 23.5% (n = 4) of nondiagnostic cases. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a targeted sequencing workflow for CSF cfDNA as well as a strategy for interpretation and reporting of sequencing results based on a molecular-guided tumor classification in glioma. See related commentary by Abdullah, p. 2860."
38294689,The Impact of Inherited Genetic Variation on DNA Methylation in Prostate Cancer and Benign Tissues of African American and European American Men.,"BACKGROUND: American men of African ancestry (AA) have higher prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates compared with American men of European ancestry (EA). Differences in genetic susceptibility mechanisms may contribute to this disparity. METHODS: To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of prostate cancer susceptibility variants, we tested the association between SNPs and DNA methylation (DNAm) at nearby CpG sites across the genome in benign and cancer prostate tissue from 74 AA and 74 EA men. Genome-wide SNP data (from benign tissue) and DNAm were generated using Illumina arrays. RESULTS: Among AA men, we identified 6,298 and 2,641 cis-methylation QTLs (meQTL; FDR of 0.05) in benign and tumor tissue, respectively, with 6,960 and 1,700 detected in EA men. We leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to identify previously reported prostate cancer GWAS signals likely to share a common causal variant with a detected meQTL. We identified nine GWAS-meQTL pairs with strong evidence of colocalization (four in EA benign, three in EA tumor, two in AA benign, and three in AA tumor). Among these colocalized GWAS-meQTL pairs, we identified colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) impacting four eGenes with known roles in tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by which prostate cancer-risk SNPs can modify local DNAm and/or gene expression in prostate tissue. IMPACT: Overall, our findings showed general consistency in the meQTL landscape of AA and EA men, but meQTLs often differ by tissue type (normal vs. cancer). Ancestry-based linkage disequilibrium differences and lack of AA representation in GWAS decrease statistical power to detect colocalization for some regions."
38294357,EGLN1: A Biomarker of Poor Prognosis of Cervical Cancer and a Target of Treatment.,"Objective: To conduct bioinformatics analysis on the prognostic effect, mechanism of action, and drug sensitivity of Egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) expression on cervical cancer. Methods: Bioinformatics were obtained from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and the human cancer metastasis database (HCMDB), and the effect of EGLN1 expression level on the prognosis of cervical cancer was comprehensively analyzed. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), and the possible mechanism of EGLN1 affecting the prognosis of cervical cancer was discussed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. In addition, Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCALite) was used to predict sensitive drugs online. Results: The higher the expression level of EGLN1, the shorter the tumor-free survival time and overall survival time of cervical cancer. The higher the stage of cervical cancer, the higher the expression level of EGLN1. The expression of EGLN1 affects the degree of immune infiltration, the variation of somatic copy number, and the level of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification in cervical cancer. COX regression model suggested that EGLN1 was an independent prognostic factor of cervical cancer. Conclusions: The high expression of EGLN1 in cervical cancer is an independent risk factor for the prognosis of cervical cancer, which affects the prognosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) through different signal pathways. It is expected to be used to predict the sensitive anticancer drugs for the treatment of cervical cancer."
38292624,Marker Ki-67 is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer based on two cohorts.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a widespread malignancy, predominantly affecting elderly males, and current methods for diagnosis and treatment of this disease continue to fall short. The marker Ki-67 (MKI67) has been previously demonstrated to correlate with the proliferation and metastasis of various cancer cells, including those of PCa. Hence, verifying the association between MKI67 and the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa, using bioinformatics databases and clinical data analysis, carries significant clinical implications. AIM: To explore the diagnostic and prognostic efficacy of antigens identified by MKI67 expression in PCa. METHODS: For cohort 1, the efficacy of MKI67 diagnosis was evaluated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. For cohort 2, the diagnostic and prognostic power of MKI67 expression was further validated using data from 271 patients with clinical PCa. RESULTS: In cohort 1, MKI67 expression was correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason Score, T stage, and N stage. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed a strong diagnostic ability, and the Kaplan-Meier method demonstrated that MKI67 expression was negatively associated with the progression-free interval (PFI). The time-ROC curve displayed a weak prognostic capability for MKI67 expression in PCa. In cohort 2, MKI67 expression was significantly related to the Gleason Score, T stage, and N stage; however, it was negatively associated with the PFI. The time-ROC curve revealed the stronger prognostic capability of MKI67 in patients with PCa. Multivariate COX regression analysis was performed to select risk factors, including PSA level, N stage, and MKI67 expression. A nomogram was established to predict the 3-year PFI. CONCLUSION: MKI67 expression was positively associated with the Gleason Score, T stage, and N stage and showed a strong diagnostic and prognostic ability in PCa."
38291708,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the landscape of biomarker in allergic rhinitis patient undergoing intracervical lymphatic immunotherapy and related pan-cancer analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the leading allergic diseases worldwide. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) induces persistent specific allergen tolerance to achieve remission of the symptoms in AR patients. We creatively conducted the intra-cervical lymphatic immunotherapy (ICLIT) for AR patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of immune cell response of AIT in AR remains elusive. METHOD: To investigate the transcriptome profile in AR patients who underwent ICLIT, we comprehensively investigated the transcriptional changes in B cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AR patient by single-cell RNA sequencing. Immunoglobulins and relative key gene, which influences the B cell differentiation, was demonstrated. The biomarkers' association with different types of tumors was investigated. RESULTS: Naive B cells, germinal center B cells, activated memory B cells, and memory B cells constituted the B cells subsets. The expression of IGHE, IGHGs, IGHA, IGHD, and IGHM from memory B cells was validated. Pseudotime analysis further indicated the dynamic change from the expression of the immunoglobulins in the memory B cells, suggesting that ITGB1 may contribute to the differentiation procedure of memory B cells. The cell-cell communication among these immune cells demonstrated the significantly enhanced CD23, BTLA signaling after ICLIT in AR patient. ITGB1 was upregulated in 13 tumors and downregulated in six others. High ITGB1 expression was linked to poor prognosis in eight types of tumors. ITGB1 expression showed correlations with tumor mutation burden, tissue purity, and microsatellite instability in different types of tumors. DISCUSSION: ITGB1 was demonstrated as a potential biomarker for AR patients after ICLIT and is significant in identifying immune infiltration in tumor tissue and predicting tumor prognosis."
38287802,Role of SLC5A8 as a Tumor Suppressor in Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The SLC5A8 gene is silenced in various types of cancer, including cervical cancer; we recently demonstrated that the SLC5A8 gene is also silenced in cervical cancer by hypermethylation of the CpG island in the gene promoter. This study aims to analyze whether SLC5A8 could be a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer. METHODS: After ectopic expressing SLC5A8 in the HeLa cell line, we evaluated its effects on cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo by Confocal immunofluorescence, cell proliferation, migration assays, and xenograft transplants. RESULTS: Overexpression of SLC5A8 in the HeLa cell line decreased its proliferation by arresting cancer cells in the G1 phase and inhibiting cellular migration. Furthermore, we observed that pyruvate increased the SLC5A8 effect, inducing S-phase arrest and inhibiting the entry into mitosis. SLC5A8 decreased tumor growth in xenograft transplants, significantly reducing the volume and tumor weight at 35 days of analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results indicate that SLC5A8 has a role as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer."
38287309,Integrated analysis identifies GABRB3 as a biomarker in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment failure following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) presents a significant challenge in the management of advanced prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the genetic factors influencing this process could facilitate the development of personalized treatments and innovative therapeutic strategies. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that genetic variants within this pathway may affect the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing ADT for prostate cancer. METHODS: We genotyped 399 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 28 core PI3K/AKT pathway genes in a cohort of 630 patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. We assessed the potential association of the SNPs with patient survival. Functional analyses of the implicated genes were also performed to evaluate their effects on prostate cancer. RESULTS: After multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple testing correction, GABRB3 rs12591845 exhibited the most significant association with both overall and cancer-specific survivals (P < 0.003). A comprehensive pooled analysis of 16 independent gene expression datasets revealed elevated expression of GABRB3 in prostate cancer tissues compared to that in normal tissues (P < 0.001). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis unveiled differential enrichment of pathways such as myogenesis, interferon gamma and alpha responses, and the MYC proto-oncogene pathway in tumors with elevated GABRB3 expression, implying a role for GABRB3 in prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that rs12591845 could potentially serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for patients undergoing ADT. The potential role of GABRB3 in promoting prostate tumorigenesis is also highlighted."

38281962,Single-cell analysis of immune and stroma cell remodeling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma primary tumors and bone metastatic lesions.,"BACKGROUND: Despite therapeutic advances, once a cancer has metastasized to the bone, it represents a highly morbid and lethal disease. One third of patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) present with bone metastasis at the time of diagnosis. However, the bone metastatic niche in humans, including the immune and stromal microenvironments, has not been well-defined, hindering progress towards identification of therapeutic targets. METHODS: We collected fresh patient samples and performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of solid metastatic tissue (Bone Met), liquid bone marrow at the vertebral level of spinal cord compression (Involved), and liquid bone marrow from a different vertebral body distant from the tumor site but within the surgical field (Distal), as well as bone marrow from patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (Benign). In addition, we incorporated single-cell data from primary ccRCC tumors (ccRCC Primary) for comparative analysis. RESULTS: The bone marrow of metastatic patients is immune-suppressive, featuring increased, exhausted CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, T regulatory cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with distinct transcriptional states in metastatic lesions. Bone marrow stroma from tumor samples demonstrated a tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cell population (TA-MSC) that appears to be supportive of epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT), bone remodeling, and a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) phenotype. This stromal subset is associated with poor progression-free and overall survival and also markedly upregulates bone remodeling through the dysregulation of RANK/RANKL/OPG signaling activity in bone cells, ultimately leading to bone resorption. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a comprehensive analysis of the bone marrow niche in the setting of human metastatic cancer and highlight potential therapeutic targets for both cell populations and communication channels."
38280376,Immunomodulatory effects and improved outcomes with cisplatin- versus carboplatin-based chemotherapy plus atezolizumab in urothelial cancer.,"In metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), cisplatin versus carboplatin leads to durable disease control in a subset of patients. The IMvigor130 trial reveals more favorable effects with atezolizumab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GemCis) versus gemcitabine and carboplatin (GemCarbo). This study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of cisplatin as a potential explanation for these observations. Our findings indicate that improved outcomes with GemCis versus GemCarbo are primarily observed in patients with pretreatment tumors exhibiting features of restrained adaptive immunity. In addition, GemCis versus GemCarbo +/- atezolizumab induces transcriptional changes in circulating immune cells, including upregulation of antigen presentation and T cell activation programs. In vitro experiments demonstrate that cisplatin, compared with carboplatin, exerts direct immunomodulatory effects on cancer cells, promoting dendritic cell activation and antigen-specific T cell killing. These results underscore the key role of immune modulation in cisplatin's efficacy in mUC and highlight the importance of specific chemotherapy backbones in immunotherapy combination regimens."
38280206,The impact of genomic biomarkers on a clinical risk prediction model for upgrading/upstaging among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The challenge of distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) complicates decision-making for men considering active surveillance (AS). Genomic classifiers (GCs) may improve risk stratification by predicting end points such as upgrading or upstaging (UG/US). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of GCs on UG/US risk prediction in a clinicopathologic model. METHODS: Participants had favorable-risk PCa (cT1-2, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] </=15 ng/mL, and Gleason grade group 1 [GG1]/low-volume GG2). A prediction model was developed for 864 men at the University of California, San Francisco, with standard clinical variables (cohort 1), and the model was validated for 2267 participants from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) registry (cohort 2). Logistic regression was used to compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to develop a prediction model for UG/US at prostatectomy. A GC (Oncotype Dx Genomic Prostate Score [GPS] or Prolaris) was then assessed to improve risk prediction. RESULTS: The prediction model included biopsy GG1 versus GG2 (odds ratio [OR], 5.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.73-9.10); PSA (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20; per 1 ng/mL), percent positive cores (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02; per 1%), prostate volume (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; per mL), and age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07; per year), with AUC 0.70 (cohort 1) and AUC 0.69 (cohort 2). GPS was associated with UG/US (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; p < .01) and AUC 0.72, which indicates a comparable performance to the prediction model. CONCLUSIONS: GCs did not substantially improve a clinical prediction model for UG/US, a short-term and imperfect surrogate for clinically relevant disease outcomes."
38278485,MED15::ATF1-Rearranged Tumor: A Novel Cutaneous Tumor With Melanocytic Differentiation.,"We recently described novel dermal tumors with melanocytic differentiation and morphologic and biological similarities to cutaneous clear cell sarcoma, including CRTC1::TRIM11 cutaneous tumor, and clear cell tumors with melanocytic differentiation and either ACTIN::MITF or MITF::CREM. Here, we describe a series of 3 patients presenting with tumors reminiscent of CRTC1::TRIM11 cutaneous tumor, found to demonstrate a novel MED15::ATF1 fusion. All 3 patients were children (5-16 years old). Primary excision of case 1 showed a circumscribed wedge-shaped silhouette with peripheral intercalation into collagen fibers and scattered lymphoid aggregates. All 3 tumors abutted the epidermis; one showed a junctional component. Tumors were highly cellular and comprised of monomorphic, oval-to-round epithelioid cells arranged in vague nests and short fascicles in variably fibrotic stroma. Mitotic rate was high (hotspot 6-12/mm(2)), without atypical mitoses. Necrosis was focally present in case 3. All cases showed strong, diffuse nuclear staining for SOX10 and MITF (2/2) but showed variable expression for S100 protein (1/3) and other melanocytic markers-Melan-A (focal in 2/3), HMB45 (focal in 1/3), and Pan-Melanoma (patchy in 1/1). Whole-exome RNA sequencing demonstrated a MED15::ATF1 fusion without any other notable alterations. Cases 1 and 2 were completely excised without recurrence (12 months). Case 3 developed a grossly apparent regional lymph node spread shortly after primary biopsy. The patient was treated with wide excision, radiation, cervical lymph node dissection (4/46 with >75% lymph node replacement), and neoadjuvant and adjuvant nivolumab (alive without disease at cycle 11). This series is presented to aid in future diagnosis of this novel dermal tumor with melanocytic differentiation and emphasize the potential for aggressive biologic behavior, which should be considered in patient management planning."
38278448,Histologic patterns in prostatic adenocarcinoma are not predictive of mutations in the homologous recombination repair pathway.,"Somatic or germline homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway gene mutations are commonly detected in prostate cancer, especially in advanced disease, and are associated with response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated whether histological patterns are predictive of HRR pathway gene mutations. The study population comprised 130 patients with advanced prostate carcinoma who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of tumor tissue at a CLIA-certified laboratory. HRR genes in the study included BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, EMSY, ATR, CHEK1, and FAM175A. Overall, 38 patients had mutations in BRCA1/2, 36 in other HRR genes, and 56 were negative for HRR mutations. All cases were re-reviewed and quantified by two genitourinary pathologists blinded to mutational status for the following histological patterns of prostate carcinoma: cribriform, ductal, intraductal carcinoma (IDC), small cell carcinoma, signet ring-like pattern, and lobular carcinoma-like pattern. Discordances were resolved by consensus review. Histologic patterns were analyzed for any correlation with mutations in HRR pathway genes (grouped as BRCA1/2 mutated or non-BRCA1/2 mutated) compared to tumors without mutations in HRR genes by Chi-square testing. Patterns with >20 % and >30 % of tumor volume were additionally evaluated for correlation with mutational status. We found no significant association between HRR pathway mutations and cribriform pattern, IDC, ductal carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, signet ring-like pattern, or lobular carcinoma-like patterns. Tumors with >20 % or >30 % histologic patterns by volume also demonstrated no significant association with mutational status. This study suggests that histopathologic examination alone is insufficient to distinguish prostate cancer with germline or somatic mutations in HRR pathway genes, highlighting the continuing importance of ancillary molecular diagnostics in guiding therapy selection for prostate cancer patients who may benefit from PARP inhibitors."
38277997,Benzo[a]pyrene exposure affects colorectal cancer susceptibility by regulating ERbeta-mediated LINC02977 transcription.,"Environmental pollutants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are produced through the incomplete combustion of organic material. While PAHs have been investigated as genotoxicants, they can also operate through nongenotoxic pathways in estrogen-dependent malignancies, such as breast, cervical and ovarian cancer. However, whether PAHs induce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk through estrogenic effects is still illusive. Here, we systematically investigated the abnormal expression and activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) regulated by PAHs in CRC as well as the underlying mechanisms of ERbeta-mediated CRC risk. Based on the 300 plasma samples from CRC patients and healthy controls detected by GC-MS/MS, we found that the plasma concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) were significantly higher in CRC cases than in healthy controls, with significant estrogenic effects. Moreover, histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-induced deacetylation of the promoter decreases ERbeta expression, which is associated with poor overall survival and advanced tumor stage. The study also revealed that BaP and estradiol (E(2)) had different carcinogenic effects, with BaP promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, while E(2) had the opposite effects. Additionally, this study mapped ERbeta genomic binding regions by performing ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq and identified genetic variants of rs1411680 and its high linkage disequilibrium SNP rs6477937, which were significantly associated with CRC risk through meta-analysis of two independent Chinese population genome-wide association studies comprising 2,248 cases and 3,173 controls and then validation in a large-scale European population. By integrating data from functional genomics, we validated the regulatory effect of rs6477937 as an ERbeta binding-disrupting SNP that mediated allele-specific expression of LINC02977 in a long-range chromosomal interaction manner, which was found to be highly expressed in CRC tissues. Overall, this study suggests that the different active effects on ERbeta by PAHs and endogenous E(2) may play a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC and highlights the potential of targeting ERbeta and its downstream targets for CRC prevention and treatment."
38273299,Preliminary study of the effect of gut microbiota on the development of prostatitis.,"BACKGROUND: Dysbacteriosis of intestinal tract may cause systemic inflammation, making distant anatomical locations more susceptible to illness. Recent research has demonstrated that the microbiome can affect both prostatitis and the inflammation of the prostate that is linked to prostate cancer. It is still unclear, though, whether this relationship indicates causation. We conducted a Mendelian randomization investigation on two samples to fully uncover gut microbiota's potential genetic causal role in prostatitis. METHOD: Prostatitis (1859 prostatitis cases and 72,799 controls) was utilized as the outcome, while SNPs highly linked with 196 microbial taxa (18 340 people) were chosen as instrumental factors. Random effects, inverse variance weighting, weighted medians, and MR-Egger were used to analyze causal effects. The Cochran's Q test, funnel plot, leave-one-out analysis, and MR-Egger intercept test were all used in the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A causal effect in lowering the incidence of prostatitis is anticipated for five gut microorganisms (Methanobacteria, Methanobacteriaceae, Erysipelatoclostridium, Parasutterella, and Slackia; P < 0.05). Four gut bacteria, including Faecalibacterium, LachnospiraceaeUCG004, Sutterella, and Gastranaerophilales, are predicted to play a causal role in increasing the risk of prostatitis (P < 0.05). There were no discernible estimates of pleiotropy or heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Our investigation established the genetic links between nine gut microorganisms and prostatitis, which may offer fresh perspectives and a theoretical framework for the future prevention and management of prostatitis."
38272101,"Prostate cancer: Molecular aspects, consequences, and opportunities of the multifocal nature.","Prostate cancer is unique compared to other major cancers due to the presence of multiple primary malignant foci in the majority of patients at the time of diagnosis. Each malignant focus has distinct somatic mutations and gene expression patterns, which represents a challenge for the development of prognostic tests for localized prostate cancer. Additionally, the molecular heterogeneity of advanced prostate cancer has important implications for management, particularly for patients with metastatic and locally recurrent cancer. Studies have shown that prostate cancers with mutations in DNA damage response genes are more sensitive to drugs inhibiting the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzyme. However, testing for such mutations should consider both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Here, we summarize studies where multiregional genomics and transcriptomics analyses have been performed for primary prostate cancer. We further discuss the vast interfocal heterogeneity and how prognostic biomarkers and a molecular definition of the index tumor should be developed. The concept of focal treatments in prostate cancer has been evolving as a demand from patients and clinicians and is one example where there is a need for defining an index tumor. Here, biomarkers must have proven value for individual malignant foci. The potential discovery and implementation of biomarkers that are agnostic to heterogeneity are also explored as an alternative to multisample testing. Thus, deciding upon whole-organ treatment, such as radical prostatectomy, should depend on information from biomarkers which are informative for the whole organ."
38271824,Study of novel ginsenoside metabolites targeting HSP70 as anti-prostate cancer drugs.,"Ginsenoside 20 (R)-25-methoxy-dammarane-3 beta, twelve beta, 20 triol (AD-1) is a promising new drug for the treatment of prostate cancer, but its bioavailability is low. This study investigated the effects of the main metabolites PD and M6 of AD-1 on prostate cancer cell PC3. The in vitro experimental results showed that the IC50 values of PC3 cells treated with PD and M6 were 65.61 and 11.72, respectively. Both PD and M6 inhibited the migration of PC3 cells, and the cell cycle was blocked in the G1 phase. The apoptosis rates of cells following M6 treatment at concentrations of 7.5, 15, and 30 muM were 13.4 %, 17.5 %, and 41.4 %, respectively, which stimulated the expression of apoptosis protein and significantly increased intracellular ROS levels. In xenograft models, PD and M6 have been reported to significantly inhibit tumor growth. We used a genome-wide mRNA expression profile to study the effects of PD and M6 on gene expression in PC3 cancer cells. PD and M6 induced downregulation of HSP70 subtypes HSPA1A and HSPA1B. RT-PCR confirmed that the significant down-regulation of HSP70 subtype expressions was consistent with the results of Transcriptome analysis. Moreover, M6 significantly downregulated the expression of AR, which was further proved by Western blot analysis. In summary, our research findings provide a scientific basis for interpreting the significant activity of AD-1 in prostate cancer, and for the research and development of PD and M6 as novel HSP70 inhibitors."
38271137,Long noncoding RNA MEG3 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by disrupting microRNA-9-5p-mediated inhibition of NDRG1 in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA MEG3 has been described to be involved in the regulation of gene expression and cancer progression. However, the role of lncMEG3 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains largely uncharted. METHODS: Differential expression of lncMEG3 was identified in PCa tissues using RNA-sequencing analysis. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the level of lncMEG3. Additionally, cellular fractionation and fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques were employed to determine the localization. Subsequently, functional assays were conducted to evaluate the impact of lncMEG3 and miR-9-5p on PCa proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. The interaction between lncMEG3 and miR-9-5p was confirmed using RNA immunoprecipitation. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays were also utilized to investigate the relationship between miR-9-5p and NDRG1. RESULTS: We observed downregulation of lncMEG3 in PCa cells and tissues. Patients with lower levels of lncMEG3 had a higher likelihood of experiencing biochemical recurrence. Overexpression of lncMEG3 resulted in the inhibition of PCa cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis. Moreover, lncMEG3 is competitively bound to miR-9-5p, preventing its inhibitory effect on the target gene NDRG1. This ultimately led to the inhibition of PCa cell proliferation and the promotion of apoptosis. Furthermore, increasing lncMEG3 levels also demonstrated inhibitory effects on PCa proliferation and promotion of apoptosis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings uncover a crucial role for lncMEG3 in inhibiting PCa proliferation and promoting apoptosis through disruption of miR-9-5p-mediated inhibition of NDRG1."
38267862,Role of microRNA-4739 in enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity by negative regulation of RHBDD2 in human cervical cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Cisplatin (DDP) is a widely used chemotherapy drug for advanced cervical cancer (CC), but resistance poses a significant challenge. While miR-4739 has been implicated in tumor development, its specific role in regulating DDP resistance in CC remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of miR-4739 and RHBDD2 in DDP-resistant and DDP-sensitive CC tissues using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and assessed their correlation through Spearman's correlation analysis. DDP-resistant CC cell lines (HeLa/DDP and SiHa/DDP) were established by gradually increasing DDP concentrations, followed by transfection with miR-4739 mimics, si-RHBDD2, or a RHBDD2 overexpression vector. A series of functional assays, including CCK-8 assay, colony formation, flow cytometry, and transwell assay were performed. The interaction between miR-4739 and RHBDD2 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. We examined the protein levels of RHBDD2, P-gP, MRP1, cleaved caspase-3, and E-cadherin through western blot analysis. Moreover, we generated xenograft tumors by injecting stably transfected HeLa/DDP cells into mice to compare their tumorigenesis capacity. RESULTS: We observed downregulation of miR-4739 and upregulation of RHBDD2 in DDP-resistant CC tissues and cell lines. MiR-4739 was shown to directly bind to RHBDD2 gene sequences to repress RHBDD2 expression in HeLa/DDP and SiHa/DDP cells. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that overexpressing miR-4739 overcame DDP resistance in CC cells by targeting RHBDD2. Furthermore, RHBDD2 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-4739 mimics on drug-resistance-related proteins (P-gP and MRP1) and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and E-cadherin in HeLa/DDP cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study revealed that miR-4739 can reverse DDP resistance by modulating RHBDD2 in CC cells."
38265515,Germline Mutations and Ancestry in Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous malignancy of men in the USA; notably, the incidence is higher among men of African, followed by European and Asian ancestry. Germline mutations and, in particular, mutations in DNA damage repair genes (DDRGs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. This review intends to discuss the implication of ancestry on prostate cancer, specifically in regard to lack of diversity in genomic and genetic databases and the ability of providers to properly counsel patients on the significance of cancer genetic results. RECENT FINDINGS: Ancestral differences in prostate cancer-associated DDRG germline mutations are increasingly recognized. Guidelines for treatment by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) (NCCN(R)) support germline testing in certain patients, and a myriad of genetic testing panels for DDRG mutations are now available in clinical practice. However, the consensus among providers on what genes and mutations to include in the genetic tests has evolved from experience from men of European ancestry (EA). Gaps in ancestry-informed clinical practice exist in genetic risk assessment, implementation of screening, counseling, guiding recommendations, treatment, and clinical trial enrollment. The lack of diversity in tumor genomic and genetic databases may hinder ancestry-specific disease-predisposing alterations from being discovered and targeted in prostate cancer and, therefore, impede the ability of providers to accurately counsel patients on the significance of cancer genetic test results."
38263342,Human papillomavirus E7 protein induces homologous recombination defects and PARPi sensitivity.,"PURPOSE: Cervical cancer is a common gynecological malignancy, pathologically associated with persistent infection of high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Previous studies revealed that HPV-positive cervical cancer displays genomic instability; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. METHODS: To investigate if DNA damage responses are aggravated in precancerous lesions of HPV-positive cervical epithelium, cervical tissues were biopsied and cryosectioned, and subjected to immunofluorescent staining. Cloned HA-tagged E6 and E7 genes of HPV16 subtype were transfected into HEK293T or C33A cells, and indirect immunofluorescent staining was applied to reveal the competency of double strand break (DSB) repair. To test the synthetic lethality of E7-indued HRD and PARP inhibitor (PARPi), we expressed E7 in C33A cells in the presence or absence of olaparib, and evaluated cell viability by colony formation. RESULTS: In precancerous lesions, endogenous DNA lesions were elevated along with the severity of CIN grade. Expressing high-risk viral factor (E7) in HPV-negative cervical cells did not impair checkpoint activation upon genotoxic insults, but affected the potential of DSB repair, leading to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Based on this HPV-induced genomic instability, the viability of E7-expressing cells was reduced upon exposure to PARPi in comparison with control cells. CONCLUSION: In aggregate, our findings demonstrate that HPV-E7 is a potential driver for genome instability and provides a new angle to understand its role in cancer development. The viral HRD could be employed to target HPV-positive cervical cancer via synthetic lethality."
38263290,Cyclic increase in the ADAMTS1-L1CAM-EGFR axis promotes the EMT and cervical lymph node metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"The matrix metalloprotease A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs 1 (ADAMTS1) was reported to be involved in tumor progression in several cancer types, but its contributions appear discrepant. At present, the role of ADAMTS1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; OSCC) remains unclear. Herein, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that ADAMTS1 transcripts were downregulated in head and neck SCC (HNSCC) tissues compared to normal tissues, but ADAMTS1 levels were correlated with poorer prognoses of HNSCC patients. In vitro, we observed that ADAMTS1 expression levels were correlated with the invasive abilities of four OSCC cell lines, HSC-3, SCC9, HSC-3M, and SAS. Knockdown of ADAMTS1 in OSCC cells led to a decrease and its overexpression led to an increase in cell-invasive abilities in vitro as well as tumor growth and lymph node (LN) metastasis in OSCC xenografts. Mechanistic investigations showed that the cyclic increase in ADAMTS1-L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) axis-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation led to exacerbation of the invasive abilities of OSCC cells via inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. Clinical analyses revealed that ADAMTS1, L1CAM, and EGFR levels were all correlated with worse prognoses of HNSCC patients, and patients with ADAMTS1(high)/L1CAM(high) or EGFR(high) tumors had the shortest overall and disease-specific survival times. As to therapeutic aspects, we discovered that an edible plant-derived flavonoid, apigenin (API), drastically inhibited expression of the ADAMTS1-L1CAM-EGFR axis and reduced the ADAMTS1-triggered invasion and LN metastasis of OSCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, API treatment significantly prolonged survival rates of xenograft mice with OSCC. In summary, ADAMTS1 may be a useful biomarker for predicting OSCC progression, and API potentially retarded OSCC progression by targeting the ADAMTS1-L1CAM-EGFR signaling pathway."
38263277,Exploring the causal association between rheumatoid arthritis and the risk of cervical cancer: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"OBJECTIVE: Whether rheumatoid arthritis patients have an increased risk of cervical cancer remains controversial, and further research is needed on this clinical question. This study aims to investigate the association between rheumatoid arthritis and the susceptibility to cervical cancer by employing Mendelian randomization methodology, utilizing the extensive dataset from human genome-wide association data analysis. METHODS: The publicly accessible MR base database was utilized to obtain the complete genome, relevant research findings, and summarized data pertaining to rheumatoid arthritis and cervical cancer. Genetic tool variables, specifically single-nucleotide polymorphisms closely linked to rheumatoid arthritis, were chosen for analysis. Four methods, namely inverse variance weighted analysis, weighted median analysis, weighted mode, and MR-Egger regression, were employed. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the potential association between rheumatoid arthritis and susceptibility to cervical cancer. RESULTS: The results of the inverse variance weighted analysis (OR = 1.096, 95% CI: 1.018-1.180, P = 0.015) indicate a significant causal relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and an increased risk of cervical cancer. Furthermore, the absence of horizontal pleiotropic effects (MR-Egger intercept = 0.00025, P = 0.574) and heterogeneity (QEgger = 2.239, I2Egger = 0.225, PEgger = 0.268, QIVW = 2.734, I2IVW = 0.220, PIVW = 0.999) suggests that the observed association is not influenced by confounding factors. Sensitivity analysis and other statistical methods also support the conclusion that genetic pleiotropy does not introduce bias to the findings. CONCLUSION: There is a causal relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and the occurrence of cervical cancer. People with rheumatoid arthritis is one of the high-risk groups for early screening of cervical cancer. The IL-18 may play a significant role in elevating the risk of cervical cancer among rheumatoid arthritis patients."
38261983,"PRESTO: A Phase III, Open-Label Study of Intensification of Androgen Blockade in Patients With High-Risk Biochemically Relapsed Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (AFT-19).","PURPOSE: Patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (BRPC) after radical prostatectomy and a short PSA doubling time are at risk for distant metastases. Apalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) prolong survival in the metastatic setting. We evaluated whether intensification of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves outcomes in BRPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PRESTO is a randomized phase III, open-label trial in patients with BRPC and PSA doubling time </=9 months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03009981). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive a finite 52-week treatment course with ADT control, ADT + apalutamide, or ADT + apalutamide + AAP. The primary end point was PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), defined as serum PSA >0.2 ng/mL after treatment completion. RESULTS: Five hundred three patients were enrolled. The median PSA was 1.8 ng/mL (IQR, 1.0-3.6). At the first planned interim analysis, both experimental arms significantly prolonged PSA-PFS compared with the control arm (median, 24.9 months for ADT + apalutamide v 20.3 months for ADT; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.77]; P = .00047; median, 26.0 months for ADT + apalutamide + AAP v 20.0 months for ADT; HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.71]; P = .00008). Median time to testosterone recovery did not differ across treatment arms. The most common grade >/=3 adverse event was hypertension (7.5%, 7.4%, and 18% in ADT, ADT + apalutamide, and ADT + apalutamide + AAP arms, respectively). CONCLUSION: Intensified AR blockade for a finite duration prolongs PSA-PFS with a manageable safety profile, without adversely affecting time to testosterone recovery. The addition of apalutamide to ADT should be considered in patients with high-risk BRPC."
38260434,Large tandem duplications in cancer result from transcription and DNA replication collisions.,"Despite the abundance of somatic structural variations (SVs) in cancer, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their formation remain unclear. Here, we use 6,193 whole-genome sequenced tumors to study the contributions of transcription and DNA replication collisions to genome instability. After deconvoluting robust SV signatures in three independent pan-cancer cohorts, we detect transcription-dependent replicated-strand bias, the expected footprint of transcription-replication collision (TRC), in large tandem duplications (TDs). Large TDs are abundant in female-enriched, upper gastrointestinal tract and prostate cancers. They are associated with poor patient survival and mutations in TP53, CDK12, and SPOP. Upon inactivating CDK12, cells display significantly more TRCs, R-loops, and large TDs. Inhibition of G2/M checkpoint proteins, such as WEE1, CHK1, and ATR, selectively inhibits the growth of cells deficient in CDK12. Our data suggest that large TDs in cancer form due to TRCs, and their presence can be used as a biomarker for prognosis and treatment."
38260432,Systematic analysis of the effects of splicing on the diversity of post-translational modifications in protein isoforms using PTM-POSE.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) and splicing are important regulatory processes for controlling protein function and activity. Despite examples of interplay between alternative splicing and cell signaling in literature, there have been few detailed analyses of the impacts of alternative splicing on PTMs, partly due to difficulties in extracting PTM information from splicing measurements. We developed a computational pipeline, PTM Projection Onto Splice Events (PTM-POSE), to identify ""prospective"" PTM sites in alternative isoforms and splice events recorded in databases using only the genomic coordinates of a splice event or isoform of interest. Importantly, PTM-POSE integrates various PTM-specific databases and tools to allow for deeper analysis of the individual and global impact of spliced PTMs on isoform function, protein interactions, and regulation by enzymes like kinases. Using PTM-POSE, we performed a systematic analysis of PTM diversification across isoforms annotated in the Ensembl database. We found that 32% of PTMs are excluded from at least one Ensembl isoform, with palmitoylation being most likely to be excluded (49%) and glycosylation and crotonylation exhibiting the highest constitutive rates (75% and 94%, respectively). Further, approximately 2% of prospective PTM sites exhibited altered regulatory sequences surrounding the modification site, suggesting that regulatory or binding interactions might be different in these proteoforms. When comparing splicing of phosphorylation sites to measured phosphorylation abundance in KRAS-expressing lung cells, differential inclusion of phosphorylation sites correlated with phosphorylation levels, particularly for larger changes in inclusion ( > 20%). To better understand how splicing diversification of PTMs may alter protein function and regulatory networks in specific biological contexts, we applied PTM-POSE to exon utilization measurements from TCGASpliceSeq of prostate tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 1,489 PTMs impacted by ESRP1-correlated splicing, a splicing factor associated with worsened prognosis. We identified protein interaction and regulatory networks that may be rewired as a result of differential inclusion of PTM sites in ribosomal and cytoskeletal proteins. We also found instances in which ESRP1-mediated splicing impacted PTMs by altering flanking residues surrounding specific phosphorylation sites that may be targets of 14-3-3 proteins and SH2 domains. In addition, SGK1 signaling was found to be influenced by ESRP1 expression through increased inclusion of SGK1 substrates in ESRP1-expressing patients. Based on validation in a separate prostate cancer cohort from the Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and EpiGenome Atlas (CPGEA), this correlated with increased phosphorylation of SGK1 substrates, particularly when SGK1 was predicted to be active. From this work, we highlighted the extensive splicing-control of PTM sites across the transcriptome and the novel information that can be gained through inclusion of PTMs in the analysis of alternative splicing. Importantly, we have provided a publicly available python package (PTM-POSE: https://github.com/NaegleLab/PTM-POSE ) and all associated data for use by the broader scientific community to allow for continued exploration of the relationship between splicing and PTMs."
38260372,A Practical Approach for Targeting Structural Variants Genome-wide in Plasma Cell-free DNA.,"Interrogating plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect cancer offers promise; however, no current tests scan structural variants (SVs) throughout the genome. Here, we report a simple molecular workflow to enrich a tumorigenic SV (DNA palindromes/fold-back inversions) that often demarcates genomic amplification and its feasibility for cancer detection by combining low-throughput next-generation sequencing with automated machine learning (Genome-wide Analysis of Palindrome Formation, GAPF-seq). Tumor DNA signal manifested as skewed chromosomal distributions of high-coverage 1-kb bins (HCBs), differentiating 39 matched breast tumor DNA from normal DNA with an average AUC of 0.9819. In a proof-of-concept liquid biopsy study, cfDNA from 0.5 mL plasma from prostate cancer patients was sufficient for binary classification against matched buffy coat DNA with an average AUC of 0.965. HCBs on the X chromosome emerged as a determinant feature and were associated with AR amplification. GAPF-seq could generate unique cancer-specific SV profiles in an agnostic liquid biopsy setting."
38257813,HPV16 E6 Oncogene Contributes to Cancer Immune Evasion by Regulating PD-L1 Expression through a miR-143/HIF-1a Pathway.,"Human Papillomaviruses have been associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer that affects women globally, while 70% of cases are caused by infection with the high-risk types HPV16 and HPV18. The integration of these viruses' oncogenes E6 and E7 into the host's genome affects a multitude of cellular functions and alters the expression of molecules. The aim of this study was to investigate how these oncogenes contribute to the expression of immune system control molecules, using cell lines with integrated HPV16 genome, before and after knocking out E6 viral gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, delivered with a lentiviral vector. The molecules studied are the T-cell inactivating protein PD-L1, its transcription factor HIF-1a and the latter's negative regulator, miR-143. According to our results, in the E6 knock out (E6KO) cell lines an increased expression of miR-143 was recorded, while a decrease in the expression of HIF-1a and PD-L1 was exhibited. These findings indicate that E6 protein probably plays a significant role in enabling cervical cancer cells to evade the immune system, while we propose a molecular pathway in cervical cancer, where PD-L1's expression is regulated by E6 protein through a miR-143/HIF-1a axis."
38256866,"New 2,4-bis[(substituted-aminomethyl)phenyl]phenylquinazoline and 2,4-bis[(substituted-aminomethyl)phenyl]phenylquinoline Derivatives: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation as Novel Anticancer Agents by Targeting G-Quadruplex.","The syntheses of novel 2,4-bis[(substituted-aminomethyl)phenyl]phenylquinazolines 12 and 2,4-bis[(substituted-aminomethyl)phenyl]phenylquinolines 13 are reported here in six steps starting from various halogeno-quinazoline-2,4-(1H,3H)-diones or substituted anilines. The antiproliferative activities of the products were determined in vitro against a panel of breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), human adherent cervical (HeLa and SiHa), and ovarian (A2780) cell lines. Disubstituted 6- and 7-phenyl-bis(3-dimethylaminopropyl)aminomethylphenyl-quinazolines 12b, 12f, and 12i displayed the most interesting antiproliferative activities against six human cancer cell lines. In the series of quinoline derivatives, 6-phenyl-bis(3-dimethylaminopropyl)aminomethylphenylquinoline 13a proved to be the most active. G-quadruplexes (G4) stacked non-canonical nucleic acid structures found in specific G-rich DNA, or RNA sequences in the human genome are considered as potential targets for the development of anticancer agents. Then, as small aza-organic heterocyclic derivatives are well known to target and stabilize G4 structures, their ability to bind G4 structures have been determined through FRET melting, circular dichroism, and native mass spectrometry assays. Finally, telomerase inhibition ability has been also assessed using the MCF-7 cell line."
38256587,Fat Matters: Exploring Cancer Risk through the Lens of Computed Tomography and Visceral Adiposity.,"Obesity is an established risk factor for cancer. However, conventional measures like body mass index lack precision in assessing specific tissue quantities, particularly of the two primary abdominal fat compartments, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Computed tomography (CT) stands as the gold standard for precisely quantifying diverse tissue types. VAT, distinguished by heightened hormonal and metabolic activity, plays a pivotal role in obesity-related tumor development. Excessive VAT is linked to aberrant secretion of adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and growth factors, fostering the carcinogenesis of obesity-related tumors. Accurate quantification of abdominal fat compartments is crucial for understanding VAT as an oncological risk factor. The purpose of the present research is to elucidate the role of CT, performed for staging purposes, in assessing VAT (quantity and distribution) as a critical factor in the oncogenesis of obesity-related tumors. In the field of precision medicine, this work takes on considerable importance, as quantifying VAT in oncological patients becomes fundamental in understanding the influence of VAT on cancer development-the potential ""phenotypic expression"" of excessive VAT accumulation. Previous studies analyzed in this research showed that VAT is a risk factor for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and hepatocarcinoma recurrence. Further studies will need to quantify VAT in other oncological diseases with specific mutations or gene expressions, in order to investigate the relationship of VAT with tumor genomics."
38256334,Germline DNA Damage Response Gene Mutations in Localized Prostate Cancer.,"Background and Objectives: Germline DNA damage response (DDR) gene mutations correlate with increased prostate cancer (PCa) risk and a more aggressive form of the disease. DDR mutation testing is recommended for metastatic PCa cases, while eligible information about the mutations' burden in the early-stage localized PCa is still limited. This study is aimed at the prospective detection of DDR pathway mutations in cases with localized PCa and correlation with clinical, histopathological, and radiological data. A comparison to the previously assessed cohort of the advanced PCa was performed. Materials and Methods: Germline DDR gene mutations were assessed prospectively in DNA samples from 139 patients, using a five-gene panel (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, and NBN) targeted next-generation sequencing. Results: This study revealed an almost three-fold higher risk of localized PCa among mutation carriers as compared to non-carriers (OR 2.84 and 95% CI: 0.75-20.23, p = 0.16). The prevalence of germline DDR gene mutations in PCa cases was 16.8% (18/107) and they were detected only in cases with PI-RADS 4/5 lesions. BRCA1/BRCA2/ATM mutation carriers were 2.6 times more likely to have a higher (>1) cISUP grade group compared to those with a CHEK2 mutation (p = 0.27). However, the number of cISUP > 1-grade patients with a CHEK2 mutation was significantly higher in advanced PCa than in localized PCa: 66.67% vs. 23.08% (p = 0.047). Conclusions: The results of our study suggest the potential of genetic screening for selected DDR gene mutations for early identification of cases at risk of aggressive PCa."
38256166,Organoids: An Emerging Precision Medicine Model for Prostate Cancer Research.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) has been known as the most prevalent cancer disease and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men almost all over the globe. There is an urgent need for establishment of PCa models that can recapitulate the progress of genomic landscapes and molecular alterations during development and progression of this disease. Notably, several organoid models have been developed for assessing the complex interaction between PCa and its surrounding microenvironment. In recent years, PCa organoids have been emerged as powerful in vitro 3D model systems that recapitulate the molecular features (such as genomic/epigenomic changes and tumor microenvironment) of PCa metastatic tumors. In addition, application of organoid technology in mechanistic studies (i.e., for understanding cellular/subcellular and molecular alterations) and translational medicine has been recognized as a promising approach for facilitating the development of potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize the application of PCa organoids in the high-throughput screening and establishment of relevant xenografts for developing novel therapeutics for metastatic, castration resistant, and neuroendocrine PCa. These organoid-based studies are expected to expand our knowledge from basic research to clinical applications for PCa diseases. Furthermore, we also highlight the optimization of PCa cultures and establishment of promising 3D organoid models for in vitro and in vivo investigations, ultimately facilitating mechanistic studies and development of novel clinical diagnosis/prognosis and therapies for PCa."
38255998,Omics Studies of Tumor Cells under Microgravity Conditions.,"Cancer is defined as a group of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth, expansion, and progression with metastasis. Various signaling pathways are involved in its development. Malignant tumors exhibit a high morbidity and mortality. Cancer research increased our knowledge about some of the underlying mechanisms, but to this day, our understanding of this disease is unclear. High throughput omics technology and bioinformatics were successful in detecting some of the unknown cancer mechanisms. However, novel groundbreaking research and ideas are necessary. A stay in orbit causes biochemical and molecular biological changes in human cancer cells which are first, and above all, due to microgravity (microg). The microg-environment provides conditions that are not reachable on Earth, which allow researchers to focus on signaling pathways controlling cell growth and metastasis. Cancer research in space already demonstrated how cancer cell-exposure to microg influenced several biological processes being involved in cancer. This novel approach has the potential to fight cancer and to develop future cancer strategies. Space research has been shown to impact biological processes in cancer cells like proliferation, apoptosis, cell survival, adhesion, migration, the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, focal adhesion, and growth factors, among others. This concise review focuses on publications related to genetic, transcriptional, epigenetic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies on tumor cells exposed to real space conditions or to simulated microg using simulation devices. We discuss all omics studies investigating different tumor cell types from the brain and hematological system, sarcomas, as well as thyroid, prostate, breast, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers, in order to gain new and innovative ideas for understanding the basic biology of cancer."
38254784,It Takes Two to Tango: The Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Its Microenvironment from an Epigenetic Perspective.,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is an urgent unmet need for novel treatment avenues. In addition to somatic genetic alterations, deviations in the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical drivers of prostate cancer initiation and progression. Unlike genomic mutations, epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible. Therefore, the inhibition of aberrant epigenetic modifications represents an attractive and exciting novel treatment strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Moreover, drugs targeting the epigenome also exhibit synergistic interactions with conventional therapeutics by directly enhancing their anti-tumorigenic properties by ""priming"" the tumor and tumor microenvironment to increase drug sensitivity. This review summarizes the major epigenetic alterations in prostate cancer and its TME, and their involvement in prostate tumorigenesis, and discusses the impact of epigenome-targeted therapies."
38254687,Identification of Molecular Markers Associated with Prostate Cancer Subtypes: An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is characterised by androgen dependency. Unfortunately, under anti-androgen treatment pressure, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) emerges, characterised by heterogeneous cell populations that, over time, lead to the development of different androgen-dependent or -independent phenotypes. Despite important advances in therapeutic strategies, CRPC remains incurable. Context-specific essential genes represent valuable candidates for targeted anti-cancer therapies. Through the investigation of gene and protein annotations and the integration of published transcriptomic data, we identified two consensus lists to stratify PCa patients' risk and discriminate CRPC phenotypes based on androgen receptor activity. ROC and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used for gene set validation in independent datasets. We further evaluated these genes for their association with cancer dependency. The deregulated expression of the PCa-related genes was associated with overall and disease-specific survival, metastasis and/or high recurrence risk, while the CRPC-related genes clearly discriminated between adeno and neuroendocrine phenotypes. Some of the genes showed context-specific essentiality. We further identified candidate drugs through a computational repositioning approach for targeting these genes and treating lethal variants of PCa. This work provides a proof-of-concept for the use of an integrative approach to identify candidate biomarkers involved in PCa progression and CRPC pathogenesis within the goal of precision medicine."
38253702,Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals the activation of PI3K signaling pathway in HPV-independent cervical cancers.,"BACKGROUND: HPV-independent cervical cancers (HPV-ind CCs) are uncommon with worse prognosis and poorly understood. This study investigated the molecular characteristics of HPV-ind CCs, aiming to explore new strategies for HPV-ind CCs. METHODS: HPV status of 1010 cervical cancer patients were detected by RT-PCR, PCR and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq were performed in identified HPV-ind CCs. The efficacy of PI3Kalpha inhibitor BYL719 in HPV-ind CCs was evaluated in cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). RESULTS: Twenty-five CCs were identified as HPV-ind, which were more common seen in older, adenocarcinoma patients and exhibited poorer prognosis as well as higher tumor mutation burden compared to HPV-associated CCs. HPV-ind CCs were featured with highly activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, particularly, PIK3CA being the most predominant genomic alteration (36%). BYL719 demonstrated superior tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, HPV-ind CCs were classified into two subtypes according to distinct prognosis by gene expression profiles, the metabolism subtype and immune subtype. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the prevalence, clinicopathology, and molecular features of HPV-ind CCs and emphasizes the importance of PIK3CA mutations and PI3K pathway activation in tumorigenesis, which suggests the potential significance of PI3Kalpha inhibitors in HPV-ind CC patients."
38253617,MARS an improved de novo peptide candidate selection method for non-canonical antigen target discovery in cancer.,"Understanding the nature and extent of non-canonical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presentation in tumour cells is a priority for target antigen discovery for the development of next generation immunotherapies in cancer. We here employ a de novo mass spectrometric sequencing approach with a refined, MHC-centric analysis strategy to detect non-canonical MHC-associated peptides specific to cancer without any prior knowledge of the target sequence from genomic or RNA sequencing data. Our strategy integrates MHC binding rank, Average local confidence scores, and peptide Retention time prediction for improved de novo candidate Selection; culminating in the machine learning model MARS. We benchmark our model on a large synthetic peptide library dataset and reanalysis of a published dataset of high-quality non-canonical MHC-associated peptide identifications in human cancer. We achieve almost 2-fold improvement for high quality spectral assignments in comparison to de novo sequencing alone with an estimated accuracy of above 85.7% when integrated with a stepwise peptide sequence mapping strategy. Finally, we utilize MARS to detect and validate lncRNA-derived peptides in human cervical tumour resections, demonstrating its suitability to discover novel, immunogenic, non-canonical peptide sequences in primary tumour tissue."
38253545,Robustness and reproducibility for AI learning in biomedical sciences: RENOIR.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly applied across various domains, favoured by the growing acquisition and public availability of large, complex datasets. Despite this trend, AI publications often suffer from lack of reproducibility and poor generalisation of findings, undermining scientific value and contributing to global research waste. To address these issues and focusing on the learning aspect of the AI field, we present RENOIR (REpeated random sampliNg fOr machIne leaRning), a modular open-source platform for robust and reproducible machine learning (ML) analysis. RENOIR adopts standardised pipelines for model training and testing, introducing elements of novelty, such as the dependence of the performance of the algorithm on the sample size. Additionally, RENOIR offers automated generation of transparent and usable reports, aiming to enhance the quality and reproducibility of AI studies. To demonstrate the versatility of our tool, we applied it to benchmark datasets from health, computer science, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) domains. Furthermore, we showcase RENOIR's successful application in recently published studies, where it identified classifiers for SET2D and TP53 mutation status in cancer. Finally, we present a use case where RENOIR was employed to address a significant pharmacological challenge-predicting drug efficacy.

38252441,Concurrent Tissue and Circulating Tumor DNA Molecular Profiling to Detect Guideline-Based Targeted Mutations in a Multicancer Cohort.,"IMPORTANCE: Tissue-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) of solid tumors is the criterion standard for identifying somatic mutations that can be treated with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-recommended targeted therapies. Sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can also identify tumor-derived mutations, and there is increasing clinical evidence supporting ctDNA testing as a diagnostic tool. The clinical value of concurrent tissue and ctDNA profiling has not been formally assessed in a large, multicancer cohort from heterogeneous clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether patients concurrently tested with both tissue and ctDNA NGS testing have a higher rate of detection of guideline-based targeted mutations compared with tissue testing alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study comprised 3209 patients who underwent sequencing between May 2020, and December 2022, within the deidentified, Tempus multimodal database, consisting of linked molecular and clinical data. Included patients had stage IV disease (non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, or colorectal cancer) with sufficient tissue and blood sample quantities for analysis. EXPOSURES: Received results from tissue and plasma ctDNA genomic profiling, with biopsies and blood draws occurring within 30 days of one another. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Detection rates of guideline-based variants found uniquely by ctDNA and tissue profiling. RESULTS: The cohort of 3209 patients (median age at diagnosis of stage IV disease, 65.3 years [2.5%-97.5% range, 43.3-83.3 years]) who underwent concurrent tissue and ctDNA testing included 1693 women (52.8%). Overall, 1448 patients (45.1%) had a guideline-based variant detected. Of these patients, 9.3% (135 of 1448) had variants uniquely detected by ctDNA profiling, and 24.2% (351 of 1448) had variants uniquely detected by solid-tissue testing. Although largely concordant with one another, differences in the identification of actionable variants by either assay varied according to cancer type, gene, variant, and ctDNA burden. Of 352 patients with breast cancer, 20.2% (71 of 352) with actionable variants had unique findings in ctDNA profiling results. Most of these unique, actionable variants (55.0% [55 of 100]) were found in ESR1, resulting in a 24.7% increase (23 of 93) in the identification of patients harboring an ESR1 mutation relative to tissue testing alone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that unique actionable biomarkers are detected by both concurrent tissue and ctDNA testing, with higher ctDNA identification among patients with breast cancer. Integration of concurrent NGS testing into the routine management of advanced solid cancers may expand the delivery of molecularly guided therapy and improve patient outcomes."
38252065,Deciphering the potential of proteomic-based biomarkers in women's reproductive diseases: empowering precision medicine in gynecology.,"CONTEXT: Gynecological disorders represent a complex set of malignancies that result from a diverse array of molecular changes affecting the lives of over a million women worldwide. Ovarian, Endometrial, and Cervical cancers, Endometriosis, PCOS are the most prevalent ones that pose a grave threat to women's health. Proteomics has emerged as an invaluable tool for developing novel biomarkers, screening methods, and targeted therapeutic agents for gynecological disorders. Some of these biomarkers have been approved by the FDA, but regrettably, they have a constrained diagnostic accuracy in early-stage diagnosis as all of these biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity. Lately, high-throughput proteomics technologies have made significant strides, allowing for identification of potential biomarkers with improved sensitivity and specificity. However, limited successes have been shown with translation of these discoveries into clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current and potential protein biomarkers for gynecological cancers, endometriosis and PCOS, discusses recent advances and challenges, and highlights future directions for the field. CONCLUSION: We propose that proteomics holds great promise as a powerful tool to revolutionize the fight against female reproductive diseases and can ultimately improve personalized patient outcomes in women's biomedicine."
38250812,Unveiling the Dichotomy of Urinary Proteins: Diagnostic Insights into Breast and Prostate Cancer and Their Roles.,"This review covers the diagnostic potential of urinary biomarkers, shedding light on their linkage to cancer progression. Urinary biomarkers offer non-invasive avenues for detecting cancers, potentially bypassing the invasiveness of biopsies. The investigation focuses primarily on breast and prostate cancers due to their prevalence among women and men, respectively. The intricate interplay of urinary proteins is explored, revealing a landscape where proteins exhibit context-dependent behaviors. The review highlights the potential impact of physical activity on urinary proteins, suggesting its influence on tumorigenic behaviors. Exercise-conditioned urine may emerge as a potential diagnostic biomarker source. Furthermore, treatment effects, notably after lumpectomy and prostatectomy, induce shifts in the urinary proteome, indicating therapeutic impacts rather than activating oncogenic signaling. The review suggests further investigations into the double-sided, context-dependent nature of urinary proteins, the potential role of post-translational modifications (PTM), and the integration of non-protein markers like mRNA and metabolites. It also discusses a linkage of urinary proteomes with secretomes from induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs). Despite challenges like cancer heterogeneity and sample variability due to age, diet, and comorbidities, harnessing urinary proteins and proteoforms may hold promise for advancing our understanding of cancer progressions, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic role of urinary proteins."
38250514,G-protein signaling of oxytocin receptor as a potential target for cabazitaxel-resistant prostate cancer.,"Although the treatment armamentarium for patients with metastatic prostate cancer has improved recently, treatment options after progression on cabazitaxel (CBZ) are limited. To identify the mechanisms underlying CBZ resistance and therapeutic targets, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with CBZ-resistant prostate cancer. Cells were clustered based on gene expression profiles. In silico screening was used to nominate candidate drugs for overcoming CBZ resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer. CTCs were divided into three to four clusters, reflecting intrapatient tumor heterogeneity in refractory prostate cancer. Pathway analysis revealed that clusters in two cases showed up-regulation of the oxytocin (OXT) receptor-signaling pathway. Spatial gene expression analysis of CBZ-resistant prostate cancer tissues confirmed the heterogeneous expression of OXT-signaling molecules. Cloperastine (CLO) had significant antitumor activity against CBZ-resistant prostate cancer cells. Mass spectrometric phosphoproteome analysis revealed the suppression of OXT signaling specific to CBZ-resistant models. These results support the potential of CLO as a candidate drug for overcoming CBZ-resistant prostate cancer via the inhibition of OXT signaling."
38250042,Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics develops a robust neuroendocrine cell-intrinsic signature to predict prostate cancer progression.,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) typically implies severe lethality and limited treatment options. The precise identification of NEPC cells holds paramount significance for both research and clinical applications, yet valid NEPC biomarker remains to be defined. Methods: Leveraging 11 published NE-related gene sets, 11 single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) cohorts, 15 bulk transcriptomic cohorts, and 13 experimental models of prostate cancer (PCa), we employed multiple advanced algorithms to construct and validate a robust NEPC risk prediction model. Results: Through the compilation of a comprehensive scRNA-seq reference atlas (comprising a total of 210,879 single cells, including 66 tumor samples) from 9 multicenter datasets of PCa, we observed inconsistent and inefficient performance among the 11 published NE gene sets. Therefore, we developed an integrative analysis pipeline, identifying 762 high-quality NE markers. Subsequently, we derived the NE cell-intrinsic gene signature, and developed an R package named NEPAL, to predict NEPC risk scores. By applying to multiple independent validation datasets, NEPAL consistently and accurately assigned NE feature and delineated PCa progression. Intriguingly, NEPAL demonstrated predictive capabilities for prognosis and therapy responsiveness, as well as the identification of potential epigenetic drivers of NEPC. Conclusion: The present study furnishes a valuable tool for the identification of NEPC and the monitoring of PCa progression through transcriptomic profiles obtained from both bulk and single-cell sources."
38249992,Molecular Insights into the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cells in Response to the Change of Extracellular Zinc.,"Zinc dyshomeostasis is manifested in breast and prostate cancer cells. This study attempted to uncover the molecular details prodded by the change of extracellular zinc by employing a panel of normal and cancerous breast and prostate cell lines coupled with the top-down proteomics with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The protein samples were generated from MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MCF10A normal breast cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and RWPE-1 normal prostate cells with or without exogenous zinc exposure in a time course (T(0) and T(120)). By comparing the cancer cells vs respective normal epithelial cells without zinc treatment (T(0)), differentially expressed proteins (23 upregulated and 18 downregulated in MCF-7 cells; 14 upregulated and 30 downregulated in PC3 cells) were identified, which provides insights into the intrinsic differences of breast and prostate cancer cells. The dynamic protein landscapes in the cancer cells prodded by the extracellular zinc treatment reveal the potential roles of the identified zinc-responsive proteins (e.g., triosephosphate isomerase, S100A13, tumour proteins hD53 and hD54, and tumour suppressor prohibitin) in breast and prostate cancers. This study, for the first time, simultaneously investigated the two kinds of cancer cells related to zinc dyshomeostasis, and the findings shed light on the molecular understanding of the breast and prostate cancer cells in response to extracellular zinc variation."
38248645,Anticancer Activity of the Marine Triterpene Glycoside Cucumarioside A(2)-2 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Despite recent advances in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), treatment is inevitably hampered by the development of drug resistance. Thus, new drugs are urgently needed. We investigated the efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of action of the marine triterpene glycoside cucumarioside A(2)-2 (CA(2)-2) using an in vitro CRPC model. CA(2)-2 induced a G(2)/M-phase cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells and caspase-dependent apoptosis executed via an intrinsic pathway. Additionally, the drug inhibited the formation and growth of CRPC cell colonies at low micromolar concentrations. A global proteome analysis performed using the 2D-PAGE technique, followed by MALDI-MS and bioinformatical evaluation, revealed alterations in the proteins involved in cellular processes such as metastatic potential, invasion, and apoptosis. Among others, the regulation of keratin 81, CrkII, IL-1beta, and cathepsin B could be identified by our proteomics approach. The effects were validated on the protein level by a 2D Western blotting analysis. Our results demonstrate the promising anticancer activity of CA(2)-2 in a prostate cancer model and provide insights on the underlying mode of action."
38242007,Tissue contexture determines the pattern and density of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas of oropharynx and uterine cervix.,"The profile of the antitumor immune response is an important factor determining patient clinical outcome. However, the influence of the tissue contexture on the composition of the tumor microenvironments of virally induced tumors is not clearly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the immune landscape of two HPV-associated malignancies: oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix (CESC). We employed multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to evaluate the density and spatial distribution of immune cells in retrospective cohorts of OPSCC and CESC patients. This approach was complemented by transcriptomic analysis of purified primary tumor cells and in silico analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing data. Transcriptomic analysis showed similar immune profiles in OPSCC and CESC samples. Interestingly, immunostaining of OPSCC tissues revealed high densities of immune cells in both tumor stroma and tumor epithelium, whereas CESC samples were mainly characterized by the lack of immune cells in the tumor epithelium. However, in contrast to other immune cell populations, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) were abundant in both segments of CESC samples and CESC-derived tumor cells expressed markedly higher levels of the PMN-MDSC chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL6 than OPSCC tumor cells. Taken together, despite their having the same etiologic agent, the immune infiltration pattern significantly differs between OPSCC and CESC, with a noticeable shift toward prominent MDSC infiltration in the latter. Our data thus present a rationale for a diverse approach to targeted therapy in patients with HPV-associated tumors of different tissue origins."
38241590,The difference of transcriptome of HPV-infected patients contributes more to the occurrence of cervical cancer than the mutations of E6 and E7 genes in HPV16.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 genes are biomarkers and drivers of the progression of cervical cancer (CxCa). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between HPV16 E6, E7 gene mutations and the occurrence and development of CxCa. Cervical exfoliated cells and clinical data of patients with cervical diseases were collected. Sample DNA was extracted, the E6 and E7 gene fragments were amplified by PCR, and the mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing and compared with standard sequences. Microarray was used to sequence the transcriptome of cells. Data of transcriptome analyzed and visualized using R software and its packages. Analysis of clinical characteristics demonstrated the association of HPV16 infection with CxCa (P < .05). Sanger sequencing results showed that the mutation sites of E6 gene included T178G/A, T350G, A131C, and T241G; among these, A131C and T241G were synonymous mutations. The mutation sites of E7 gene included A647G, T846C, G666A, T843C, and T760C, and all of them were synonymous mutations except A647G. There was no significant difference in the distribution of HPV16 E6, E7 mutations among CxCa, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and infection groups (P > .05). Compared with the non- CxCa group, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed more significant enrichment of DEGs in the biological processes, pathways, and diseases closely related to cancer. Compared with the non-mutation group, the DEGs in the E6, E7 gene mutation group were significantly enriched in the events related to infection and immunity. To summarize, HPV16 may be associated with the occurrence and development of CxCa, but HPV16 E6 and E7 gene mutations have little effect on the occurrence and development of CxCa. Individual differences may have a greater effect on the progression of CxCa."
38241570,Identification of a novel genomic variance of BRAF1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the predominant subtypes accounting for approximately 85% of thyroid carcinomas, has a rapidly increasing global incidence rate. Statistically, approximately 74.6% PTC patients had the genomic variants of BRAF, especially BRAFV600E mutation, which has been reported to stratify patients and guide clinic-therapies. However, some PTC patients may carry other nonclassical mutation patterns of BRAF, due to the complex of genomic instability. And the spectrum of BRAF mutation was not fully characterized. We reported a novel BRAF mutation pattern of PTC. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of the slight enlargement of bilateral cervical lymph nodes in July 2023. DIAGNOSIS: Ultrasonography revealed that the bilateral thyroid nodules of the patients both presented 1 hypoechoic nodule, which was graded as 3 of the elastic score, and the small calcification in the right lobe (Chinese-Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System 4c). Pathological diagnosis showed the interstitial collagen change and focal follicular epithelial papillary hyperplasia with atypical hyperplasia of the bilateral thyroid. Further puncture pathology showed that the patient had a malignant thyroid lesion with the phenotypes of papillary carcinoma and diagnosed with malignancy subsequently. Additionally, the patient harbored a novel insert on BRAF exon 15, a 6-base fragment AGACAG inserting between c.1798 and c.1799. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was undergone on microwave ablation of thyroid carcinoma on July 28, 2023. After the surgery, the patient was treated on anti-infection, cold saline external application of bilateral thyroid swelling supportive treatment. OUTCOMES: No postoperative complications or recurrence and metastasis were found. LESSONS: This is the first case of the novel nonclassical genomic variant of BRAF. Our study extends the spectrum of BRAF mutations. The patient had a favorable response to microwave ablation, indicating that in spite of the association between this mutation and high-grade malignant phenotype, this genomic variant of BRAF did not have a detrimental effect on the response of clinical treatment."
38240194,Enhancing Metabolome Annotation by Electron Impact Excitation of Ions from Organics-Molecular Networking.,"Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is widely used in untargeted metabolomics, but large-scale and high-accuracy metabolite annotation remains a challenge due to the complex nature of biological samples. Recently introduced electron impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) fragmentation can generate information-rich fragment ions. However, effective utilization of EIEIO tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is hindered by the lack of reference spectral databases. Molecular networking (MN) shows great promise in large-scale metabolome annotation, but enhancing the correlation between spectral and structural similarity is essential to fully exploring the benefits of MN annotation. In this study, a novel approach was proposed to enhance metabolite annotation in untargeted metabolomics using EIEIO and MN. MS/MS spectra were acquired in EIEIO and collision-induced dissociation (CID) modes for over 400 reference metabolites. The study revealed a stronger correlation between the EIEIO spectra and metabolite structure. Moreover, the EIEIO spectral network outperformed the CID spectral network in capturing structural analogues. The annotation performance of the structural similarity network for untargeted LC-MS/MS was evaluated. For the spiked NIST SRM 1950 human plasma, the annotation coverage and accuracy were 72.94 and 74.19%, respectively. A total of 2337 metabolite features were successfully annotated in NIST SRM 1950 human plasma, which was twice that of LC-CID MS/MS. Finally, the developed method was applied to investigate prostate cancer. A total of 87 significantly differential metabolites were annotated. This study combining EIEIO and MN makes a valuable contribution to improving metabolome annotation."
38237138,Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection and genotype distribution among Kazakhstani women with abnormal cervical cytology.,"AIM: This study aimed to identify the prevalence and distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types among Kazakhstani women with abnormal cervical cytology. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from May 2019 to June 2020. Cervical samples were collected from women in the different regions of Kazakhstan. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients' samples were analysed for HR-HPV using real-time multiplex PCR. Cervical cytology abnormalities were reported according to the Bethesda classification. HPV detection by cytology showed a statistically significant association with HPV status and the number of HPV infection types (p < .05). Among women with abnormal cervical cytology, 62.4% were positive for HPV infection of those 79.4% had low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and 20.6% had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Among patients with LSIL, 77.4% had HPV16 and 58.8% were infected with HPV18. Among patients with HSIL, 41.2% had HPV18 and 22.6% - HPV16. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of HR-HPV types among Kazakhstani women with abnormal cervical cytology. The most identified types were HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 52. There is an emergency need to implement an HPV vaccination program to prevent cervical lesion development."
38236062,Cancer Mutations Converge on a Collection of Protein Assemblies to Predict Resistance to Replication Stress.,"Rapid proliferation is a hallmark of cancer associated with sensitivity to therapeutics that cause DNA replication stress (RS). Many tumors exhibit drug resistance, however, via molecular pathways that are incompletely understood. Here, we develop an ensemble of predictive models that elucidate how cancer mutations impact the response to common RS-inducing (RSi) agents. The models implement recent advances in deep learning to facilitate multidrug prediction and mechanistic interpretation. Initial studies in tumor cells identify 41 molecular assemblies that integrate alterations in hundreds of genes for accurate drug response prediction. These cover roles in transcription, repair, cell-cycle checkpoints, and growth signaling, of which 30 are shown by loss-of-function genetic screens to regulate drug sensitivity or replication restart. The model translates to cisplatin-treated cervical cancer patients, highlighting an RTK-JAK-STAT assembly governing resistance. This study defines a compendium of mechanisms by which mutations affect therapeutic responses, with implications for precision medicine. SIGNIFICANCE: Zhao and colleagues use recent advances in machine learning to study the effects of tumor mutations on the response to common therapeutics that cause RS. The resulting predictive models integrate numerous genetic alterations distributed across a constellation of molecular assemblies, facilitating a quantitative and interpretable assessment of drug response. This article is featured in Selected Articles from This Issue, p. 384."
38235353,Identification of Plausible Candidates in Prostate Cancer Using Integrated Machine Learning Approaches.,"BACKGROUND: Currently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is commonly used as a prostate cancer (PCa) biomarker. PSA is linked to some factors that frequently lead to erroneous positive results or even needless biopsies of elderly people. OBJECTIVES: In this pilot study, we undermined the potential genes and mutations from several databases and checked whether or not any putative prognostic biomarkers are central to the annotation. The aim of the study was to develop a risk prediction model that could help in clinical decision-making. METHODS: An extensive literature review was conducted, and clinical parameters for related comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, as well as PCa, were collected. Such parameters were chosen with the understanding that variations in their threshold values could hasten the complicated process of carcinogenesis, more particularly PCa. The gathered data was converted to semi-binary data (-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1), on which machine learning (ML) methods were applied. First, we cross-checked various publicly available datasets, some published RNA-seq datasets, and our whole-exome sequencing data to find common role players in PCa, diabetes, and obesity. To narrow down their common interacting partners, interactome networks were analysed using GeneMANIA and visualised using Cytoscape, and later cBioportal was used (to compare expression level based on Z scored values) wherein various types of mutation w.r.t their expression and mRNA expression (RNA seq FPKM) plots are available. The GEPIA 2 tool was used to compare the expression of resulting similarities between the normal tissue and TCGA databases of PCa. Later, top-ranking genes were chosen to demonstrate striking clustering coefficients using the Cytoscape-cytoHubba module, and GEPIA 2 was applied again to ascertain survival plots. RESULTS: Comparing various publicly available datasets, it was found that BLM is a frequent player in all three diseases, whereas comparing publicly available datasets, GWAS datasets, and published sequencing findings, SPFTPC and PPIMB were found to be the most common. With the assistance of GeneMANIA, TMPO and FOXP1 were found as common interacting partners, and they were also seen participating with BLM. CONCLUSION: A probabilistic machine learning model was achieved to identify key candidates between diabetes, obesity, and PCa. This, we believe, would herald precision scale modeling for easy prognosis."
38235142,Chemical immune conization of precancerous cervical lesions awakens immune cells and restores normal HPV negative and abnormal proliferation.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers in women, which is closely linked to the persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Current treatment of cervical cancer involves radical hysterectomy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy or a combination. OBJECTIVE: We investigated if hapten-enhanced intratumoral chemotherapy (HEIC) was effective in boosting immunity for effective treatment of precancerous cervical lesions and HPV infection. STUDY DESIGN: We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to obtain transcriptome profiles of 40,239 cells from biopsies of precancerous cervical lesions from the cervix directly from one patient before the start of HEIC and approximately 1 week after HEIC. The blood samples were taken at the same time as biopsies. We compared the expression characteristics of malignant epithelial cells and immune cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells (ECs), fibroblasts, mural cells, T cells, B cells, T and NK neutrophils, mast cells, microparticles (MPs), and platelets, as well as the dynamic changes in cell percentage and cell subtype heterogeneity. RESULTS: Intratumoral injection of chemotherapy drug plus hapten induces an acute immune response in precancerous cervical lesions with HPV and further awakens immune cells to prevent the abnormal proliferation of the precancerous cells. CONCLUSION: HEIC provides a potential treatment method for cervical cancer and HPV infection tailored to each patient's condition."
38234717,Mapping inherited genetic variation with opposite effects on autoimmune disease and cancer identifies candidate drug targets associated with the anti-tumor immune response.,"BACKGROUND: Germline alleles near genes that encode certain immune checkpoints (CTLA4, CD200) are associated with autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease and cancer but in opposite directions. This motivates a systematic search for additional germline alleles which demonstrate this pattern with the aim of identifying potential cancer immunotherapeutic targets using human genetic evidence. METHODS: Pairwise fixed effect cross-disorder meta-analyses combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for breast, prostate, ovarian and endometrial cancers (240,540 cases/317,000 controls) and seven autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases (112,631 cases/895,386 controls) coupled with in silico follow-up. To ensure detection of alleles with opposite effects on cancer and autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease, the signs on the beta coefficients in the autoimmune/autoinflammatory GWAS were reversed prior to meta-analyses. RESULTS: Meta-analyses followed by linkage disequilibrium clumping identified 312 unique, independent lead variants with P(meta)<5x10(-8) associated with at least one of the cancer types at P(cancer)<10(-3) and one of the autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases at P(auto)<10(-3). At each lead variant, the allele that conferred autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease risk was protective for cancer. Mapping each lead variant to its nearest gene as its putative functional target and focusing on genes with established immunological effects implicated 32 of the nearest genes. Tumor bulk RNA-Seq data highlighted that the tumor expression of 5/32 genes (IRF1, IKZF1, SPI1, SH2B3, LAT) were each strongly correlated (Spearman's rho>0.5) with at least one intra-tumor T/myeloid cell infiltration marker (CD4, CD8A, CD11B, CD45) in every one of the cancer types. Tumor single-cell RNA-Seq data from all cancer types showed that the five genes were more likely to be expressed in intra-tumor immune versus malignant cells. The five lead SNPs corresponding to these genes were linked to them via expression quantitative trait locus mechanisms and at least one additional line of functional evidence. Proteins encoded by the genes were predicted to be druggable. CONCLUSION: We provide population-scale germline genetic and functional genomic evidence to support further evaluation of the proteins encoded by IRF1, IKZF1, SPI1, SH2B3, and LAT as possible targets for cancer immunotherapy."
38234609,Comprehensive analysis and immunohistochemistry localization of NRP1 expression in pancancer and normal individual tissues in relation to SARS‑CoV‑2 susceptibility.,"Neuropilin 1 (NRP1/CD304) is a typical membrane-bound co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor, semaphorin family members and viral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, NRP1 expression levels across cancer types and the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer are not clear. Online databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas database of Human Protein Atlas, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis and cBioPortal were used for the expression analysis in this study. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for NRP1 was performed in the tissues of patients with non-small cell carcinoma. As a result, it was found that NRP1 mRNA and protein expression levels were highest in the female reproductive tissues and the respiratory system, specifically in the nasopharynx, bronchus and fallopian tube, as well as in adipocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Sertoli cells, endothelial cells and dendritic cells. IHC showed that the NRP1 protein was mainly localized to the cytoplasm and membrane in the tissues of patients with non-small cell carcinoma, demonstrating its role in lung infection by SARS-CoV-2, due to invasion of cell membranes by the virus. Levels of NRP1 mRNA were significantly increased in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, esophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), pancreatic adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and thymoma, and significantly decreased in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, kidney chromophobe, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma, compared with corresponding healthy tissues in pancancer, indicating roles for viral invasion in most cancer types. Moreover, low NRP1 expression was significantly associated with long overall survival (OS) time in adrenocortical carcinoma, brain lower grade glioma, stomach adenocarcinoma and uveal melanoma, but with short OS time in KIRC only. The ENST00000374867.6 (NRP1-202) isoform is most highly expressed in most cancer types and thus could be involved in tumorigenesis and SARS-CoV-2 invasion in cancer patients. NRP1 may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 invasion in patients with cancer, including those with lung cancer."
38234396,T-cell receptor determinants of response to chemoradiation in locally-advanced HPV16-driven malignancies.,"BACKGROUND: The effect of chemoradiation on the anti-cancer immune response is being increasingly acknowledged; however, its clinical implications in treatment responses are yet to be fully understood. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven malignancies express viral oncogenic proteins which may serve as tumor-specific antigens and represent ideal candidates for monitoring the peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) changes secondary to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: We performed intra-tumoral and pre- and post-treatment peripheral TCR sequencing in a cohort of patients with locally-advanced HPV16-positive cancers treated with CRT. An in silico computational pipeline was used to cluster TCR repertoire based on epitope-specificity and to predict affinity between these clusters and HPV16-derived epitopes. RESULTS: Intra-tumoral repertoire diversity, intra-tumoral and post-treatment peripheral CDR3beta similarity clustering were predictive of response. In responders, CRT triggered an increase peripheral TCR clonality and clonal relatedness. Post-treatment expansion of baseline peripheral dominant TCRs was associated with response. Responders showed more baseline clustered structures of TCRs maintained post-treatment and displayed significantly more maintained clustered structures. When applying clustering by TCR-specificity methods, responders displayed a higher proportion of intra-tumoral TCRs predicted to recognise HPV16 peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline TCR characteristics and changes in the peripheral T-cell clones triggered by CRT are associated with treatment outcome. Maintenance and boosting of pre-existing clonotypes are key elements of an effective anti-cancer immune response driven by CRT, supporting a paradigm in which the immune system plays a central role in the success of CRT in current standard-of-care protocols."

38233329,Patient-reported Side Effects 1 Year After Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Register-based Nationwide Study.,"BACKGROUND: Data on functional and psychological side effects following curative treatment for prostate cancer are lacking from large, contemporary, unselected, population-based cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To assess urinary symptoms, bowel disturbances, erectile dysfunction (ED), and quality of life (QoL) 12 mo after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and radiotherapy (RT) using patient-reported outcome measures in the Swedish prostate cancer database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a nationwide, population-based, cohort study in Sweden of men who underwent primary RARP or RT between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Absolute proportions and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, with adjustment for clinical characteristics. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 2557 men underwent RARP and 1741 received RT. Men who underwent RT were older (69 vs 65 yr) and had more comorbidities at baseline. After RARP, 13% of men experienced incontinence, compared to 6% after RT. The frequency of urinary bother was similar, at 18% after RARP and 18% after RT. Urgency to defecate was reported by 14% of men after RARP and 34% after RT. At 1 yr, 73% of men had ED after RARP, and 77% after RT. High QoL was reported by 85% of men after RARP and 78% of men after RT. On multivariable regression analysis, RT was associated with lower risks of urinary incontinence (OR 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.33), urinary bother (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95), and ED (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46-0.65), but higher risk of bowel symptoms (OR 2.86, 95% CI 2.42-3.39). QoL was higher after RARP than after RT (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.12-1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term specific side effects after curative treatment for prostate cancer significantly differed between RARP and RT in this large and unselected cohort. Nevertheless, the risk of urinary bother was lower after RT, while higher QoL was common after RARP. PATIENT SUMMARY: In our study of patients treated for prostate cancer, urinary bother and overall quality of life are comparable at 1 year after surgical removal of the prostate in comparison to radiotherapy, despite substantial differences in other side effects."
38229478,What is cancer? A focus on Grade Group 1 prostate cancer.,"Since the widespread adoption of prostate-specific antigen-based screening for prostate cancer, the prevalence of Grade Group 1 (GG1) prostate cancer has risen. Historically, these patients were subjected to overtreatment of this otherwise indolent disease process, leading to significant quality-of-life detriments. Active surveillance as a primary management strategy has allowed for a focus on early detection while minimising morbidity from unnecessary intervention. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of GG1 prostatic adenocarcinoma, including its histological features, genomic differentiators, clinical progression, and implications for treatment guidelines, all supporting the movement to reclassify GG1 disease as a non-cancerous entity."
38229169,A Promising New Model: Establishment of Patient-Derived Organoid Models Covering HPV-Related Cervical Pre-Cancerous Lesions and Their Cancers.,"The lack of human-derived in vitro models that recapitulate cervical pre-cancerous lesions has been the bottleneck in researching human papillomavirus (HPV) infection-associated pre-cancerous lesions and cancers for a long time. Here, a long-term 3D organoid culture protocol for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical squamous cell carcinoma that stably recapitulates the two tissues of origin is described. Originating from human-derived samples, a small biobank of cervical pre-tumoroids and tumoroids that faithfully retains genomic and transcriptomic characteristics as well as the causative HPV genome is established. Cervical pre-tumoroids and tumoroids show differential responses to common chemotherapeutic agents and grow differently as xenografts in mice. By coculture organoid models with peripheral blood immune cells (PBMCs) stimulated by HPV antigenic peptides, it is illustrated that both organoid models respond differently to immunized PBMCs, supporting organoids as reliable and powerful tools for studying virus-specific T-cell responses and screening therapeutic HPV vaccines. In this study, a model of cervical pre-cancerous lesions containing HPV is established for the first time, overcoming the bottleneck of the current model of human cervical pre-cancerous lesions. This study establishes an experimental platform and biobanks for in vitro mechanistic research, therapeutic vaccine screening, and personalized treatment for HPV-related cervical diseases."
38224713,Expression of anoctamin 7 (ANO7) is associated with poor prognosis and mucin 2 (MUC2) in colon adenocarcinoma: a study based on TCGA data.,"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is the predominant type of colorectal cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of COAD patients. Anoctamin 7 (ANO7), an anion channel protein, has been implicated in prostate cancer and other types of cancer. In this study, we analyzed the expression of ANO7 and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics among COAD patients using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham CANcer (UALCAN) databases. The GEPIA2, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and the Survival Genie platform were employed for survival analysis. The co-expression network and potential function of ANO7 in COAD were analyzed using GeneFriends, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), GeneMANIA, and Pathway Studio. Our data analysis revealed a significant reduction in ANO7 expression levels within COAD tissues compared to normal tissues. Additionally, ANO7 expression was found to be associated with race and histological subtype. The COAD patients exhibiting low ANO7 expression had lower survival rates compared to those with high ANO7 expression. The genes correlated with ANO7 were significantly enriched in proteolysis and mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, ANO7 demonstrated a direct interaction and a positive co-expression correlation with mucin 2 (MUC2). In conclusion, our findings suggest that ANO7 might serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and potentially plays a role in proteolysis and mucin biosynthesis in the context of COAD."
38224014,The CXCLs-CXCR2 axis modulates the cross-communication between tumor-associated neutrophils and tumor cells in cervical cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to check the expression profile of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligands (CXCLs)-C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) axis in cervical cancer and to explore the cross-talk between cervical cancer cells and neutrophils via CXCLs-CXCR2 axis. METHODS: Available RNA-sequencing data based on bulk tissues and single-cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing data were used for bioinformatic analysis. Cervical cancer cell lines Hela and SiHa cells were utilized for in vitro and in vivo studies. RESULTS: Except for neutrophils, CXCR2 mRNA expression is limited in other types of cells in the cervical tumor microenvironment. CXCLs bind to CXCR2 and are mainly expressed by tumor cells. CXCL1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8, which are consistently associated with neutrophil infiltration, are also linked to poor prognosis. SB225002 (a CXCR2 inhibitor) treatment significantly impairs SiHa cell-induced neutrophil migration. CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, or CXCL8 neutralized conditioned medium from SiHa cells have weaker recruiting effects. The conditioned medium of neutrophils from healthy donors can slow cancer cell proliferation. Conditioned medium of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) can drastically enhance cervical cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The CXCLs-CXCR2 axis is critical in neutrophil recruitment and tumor cell proliferation in the cervical cancer microenvironment."
38223983,Treatment-related Neuroendocrine Prostate Carcinoma-Diagnostic and Molecular Correlates.,"Treatment-related neuroendocrine prostate cancer is a distinctive category of prostate cancer that arises after intensive suppression of the androgen receptor by next-generation therapeutic inhibition of androgen receptor signaling. The biological processes that set in motion the series of events resulting in transformation of adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine carcinoma include genomic (loss of tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1, amplification of oncogenes N-MYC and Aurora Kinase A, dysregulation of transcription factors SOX2, achaete-scute-homolog 1, and others) as well as epigenomic (DNA methylation, EZH2 overexpression, and others). Pathologic diagnosis is key to effective therapy for this disease, and this is aided by localizing metastatic lesions for biopsy using radioligand imaging in the appropriate clinical context. As our understanding of biology evolves, there has been increased morphologic recognition and characterization of tumor phenotypes that are present in this advanced post-treatment setting. New and promising biomarkers (delta-like ligand 3 and others) have been discovered, which opens up novel therapeutic avenues including immunotherapy and antibody-drug conjugates for this lethal disease with currently limited treatment options."
38222791,Diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer risk: A mendelian randomization analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Some studies have directed towards an association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and prostate cancer (PCa); however, this specific relationship remains inconclusive. In recent years, Mendelian randomization (MR) has become a widely used analytical method for inferring epidemiological causes. AIM: To investigated the potential relationship between DM and PCa using MR. METHODS: We downloaded relevant data on ""diabetes"" and ""PCa"" from the IEU OpenGWAS project database, performed three different methods to conduct MR, and carried out sensitivity analysis for verification. RESULTS: The results indicated that DM was an independent risk factor for PCa. The odds ratio (OR) values obtained using the inverse variance weighted method in this study were as follows: OR = 1.018 (95% confidence interval: 1.004-1.032), P = 0.014. CONCLUSION: We found that DM could increase the incidence rate of PCa."
38221899,Constructed competitive endogenous RNA network and patterns of immune infiltration revealing the prognostic signature for cervical cancer.,"Aim: To investigate the relationship between potential abnormal epigenetic modification and immune cell infiltration in patients with cervical carcinoma. Materials & methods: RNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used to explore the relationship between key biomarkers and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and for clinical specimen validation. Results: Two nomogram models were developed, one with specific ceRNA and the other based on biological markers of related tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Moreover, a key biomarker (RIPOR2), which was significantly relevant to CD8 T cells. Conclusion: RIPOR2 and CD8 T cells play a crucial role in the development and progression of cervical carcinoma, suggesting their potential as markers for guiding future therapeutic strategies."
38221616,Integrating single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data unveils antigen presentation and process-related CAFS and establishes a predictive signature in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are heterogeneous and can influence the progression of prostate cancer in multiple ways; however, their capacity to present and process antigens in PRAD has not been investigated. In this study, antigen presentation and process-related CAFs (APPCAFs) were identified using bioinformatics, and the clinical implications of APPCAF-related signatures in PRAD were investigated. METHODS: SMART technology was used to sequence the transcriptome of primary CAFs isolated from patients undergoing different treatments. Differential expression gene (DEG) screening was conducted. A CD4 + T-cell early activation assay was used to assess the activation degree of CD4 + T cells. The datasets of PRAD were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the list of 431 antigen presentation and process-related genes was obtained from the InnateDB database. Subsequently, APP-related CAFs were identified by nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on a single-cell seq (scRNA) matrix. GSVA functional enrichment analyses were performed to depict the biological functions. A risk signature based on APPCAF-related genes (APPCAFRS) was developed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, and the independence of the risk score as a prognostic factor was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, a biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS)-related nomogram was established, and immune-related characteristics were assessed using the ssGSEA function. The immune treatment response in PRAD was further analyzed by the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) tool. The expression levels of hub genes in APPCAFRS were verified in cell models. RESULTS: There were 134 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes, totaling 281 differentially expressed genes among the primary CAFs. The functions and pathways of 147 downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in antigen processing and presentation processes, MHC class II protein complex and transport vesicle, MHC class II protein complex binding, and intestinal immune network for IgA production. Androgen withdrawal diminished the activation effect of CAFs on T cells. NMF clustering of CAFs was performed by APPRGs, and pseudotime analysis yielded the antigen presentation and process-related CAF subtype CTSK + MRC2 + CAF-C1. CTSK + MRC2 + CAF-C1 cells exhibited ligand‒receptor connections with epithelial cells and T cells. Additionally, we found a strong association between CTSK + MRC2 + CAF-C1 cells and inflammatory CAFs. Through differential gene expression analysis of the CTSK + MRC2 + CAF-C1 and NoneAPP-CAF-C2 subgroups, 55 significant DEGs were identified, namely, APPCAFRGs. Based on the expression profiles of APPCAFRGs, we divided the TCGA-PRAD cohort into two clusters using NMF consistent cluster analysis, with the genetic coefficient serving as the evaluation index. Four APPCAFRGs, THBS2, DPT, COL5A1, and MARCKS, were used to develop a prognostic signature capable of predicting BCR occurrence in PRAD patients. Subsequently, a nomogram with stability and accuracy in predicting BCR was constructed based on Gleason grade (p = n.s.), PSA (p < 0.001), T stage (p < 0.05), and risk score (p < 0.01). The analysis of immune infiltration showed a positive correlation between the abundance of resting memory CD4 + T cells, M1 macrophages, resting dendritic cells, and the risk score. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of THBS2, DPT, COL5A1, and MARCKS in the cell models were consistent with the results of the bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: APPCAFRS based on four potential APPCAFRGs was developed, and their interaction with the immune microenvironment may play a crucial role in the progression to castration resistance of PRAD. This novel approach provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of PRAD and offers unexplored targets for future research."
38217083,An integrative analysis of GEO data to identify possible therapeutic biomarkers of prostate cancer and targeting potential protein through Zea mays phytochemicals by virtual screening approaches.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is a prevalent type of cancer among men. Delaying the treatment of patients with upgraded or upstaged cancer may lead to unmanageable circumstances. The aim of this study is to contribute to the finding of biomarkers that are specific to PC and identify drug candidates derived from plants. The information about cancer is critical for clinicians to make decisions about patient treatment in the era of precision medicine. Advances in genomics technology have opened up new possibilities for identifying genes that are associated with cancer, including PC. This study identifies novel differentially expressed genes for PC. The seven PC microarray datasets were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)/Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found based on a fold change of |logFC| >/= 1 and an adjusted p-value of <0.05. The DEGs were further studied using several bioinformatics tools, including STRING, CytoHubba, SRplot, Coremine Medical database, FunRich and GeneMANIA, cBioPortal. The six new potential biomarkers, GAGE2A, GAGE12G, GAGE2E, GAGE13, GAGE12F and CSAG1 were identified. These biomarkers are associated with biological processes (BPs) such as cell division, and gene expression regulation, so these genes may have a crucial role in PC progression and may serve as potential biomarkers for PC. A total of 497 phytochemicals from corn plants have been screened against the target protein and found LTS0176591 as the best lead molecule with docking score of -6.31 kcal/mol. Further, molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA), molecular dynamics simulation, principal component analysis (PCA), free energy landscape (FEL) and molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) were carried out to validate the findings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

38212262,Association of HLA class I and II genes with cervical cancer susceptibility in a Han Chinese population.,"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in females worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified CC-related susceptibility loci in HLA regions. To investigate the associations between HLA genes and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical cancer (CC), six loci of HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) and II (HLA-DRB1, -DPB1, and -DQB1) were selected for genotyping, and the associations between these alleles or their haplotypes with CIN or CC risk or protection from disease were evaluated. In total, 2193 participants, including 909 healthy individuals in the control group, 769 patients with CC, and 515 patients with CIN2+ (CIN II and III), were enrolled in the current study. HLA genes were genotyped using the NGSgo Illumina MiSeq workflow, and the associations between these loci and CIN2+ or CC at the allele and haplotype levels were analyzed. The allele frequencies of HLA-A*33:03, B*58:01, C*03:02, DPB1*05:01, and DRB1*12:01 were lower in both the CC and CIN2+ groups than in the control group, whereas those of B*55:02, C*04:03, and DPB1*03:01 were higher in the CC group than in the control group. In the histologic CC type analysis, the differences in the frequencies of these alleles in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix and stage I CC showed a consistent trend. In the haplotype analysis, the frequency of A*33:03-C*03:02-B*58:01 was lower in the CC and CIN2+ groups than in the control group, and that of A*24:02-C*04:03-B*15:25 was higher in the CC group than in both the control and CIN2+ groups. These three different haplotype frequencies were also identified in the FIGO CC stage analysis. In addition, in human papilloma virus (HPV) genotype analyses, the frequencies of HLA-C*03:02 and DPB1*05:01 were significantly lower in the CC and CIN2+ groups than in the control group, and in SCC subgroup, the frequencies of HLA-DQB1*04:01 and DRB1*04:05 were higher in the HPV other genotype infection group than in the HPV16 infection group. In both HPV16 single infection and coinfection with other HPVs, the frequency of haplotype A*33:03-C*03:02-B*58:01 was lower in both CC and CIN2+ than in the control group, while the frequencies of A*11:01-C*14:02-B*51:01 and A*24:02-C*03:04-B*13:01 were higher in the CIN2+ than in CC and the control group. In the HPV16 and other HPV infection comparisons, the frequencies of DRB1*04:05-DQB1*04:01-DPB1*02:01 and DRB1*11:01-DQB1*03:01-DPB1*05:01 were lower in the HPV16 infection group than in the other HPV infection group. Our results suggest that the HLA class I and II genes may affect the risk of CIN and CC as well as the histologic CC types and FIGO stages of CC in the Han Chinese population. In addition, HLA genes were associated with HPV16 infection at both the allelic and haplotype levels."
38206304,Immune landscape and heterogeneity of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.,"Despite the differences in disease outcomes and pathological features between cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC), the molecular characteristics in immune heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment remain unclear. Here, we explored the immune landscape and heterogeneity between CSCC and ADC. Gene expression and clinical characteristics of cervical carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), immune cell infiltration, and pathway enrichment analyses were used to explore the immune landscape and heterogeneity between CSCC and ADC. Furthermore, distinct immune signatures between CSCC and ADC were validated based on clinical samples. In total, 4,132 upregulated DEGs and 2,307 down-regulated DEGs were identified between CSCC and ADC, with enrichments in immune related-pathways in CSCC. In addition, 54 hub DEGs correlated with patients' prognosis and immunocytes infiltration were identified. The CSCC patients had a higher ImmuneScore and more abundant immunocytes infiltration compared to ADC patients, as validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and multicolor immunofluorescence (mIF) analyses of collected samples. Furthermore, CSCC displayed higher inhibitory immune checkpoints expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) compared to ADC, which indicated CSCC patients were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. In summary, our results revealed the huge immune heterogeneity between CSCC and ADC, and provided guidance for immunotherapy selection for different pathological types of cervical cancer."
38206293,An endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signature featuring ASNS for predicting prognosis and immune landscape in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PRAD) is one of the common malignant tumors of the urinary system. In order to predict the treatment results for PRAD patients, this study proposes to develop a risk profile based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Based on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) cohort and the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE70769), we verified the predictive signature. Using a random survival forest analysis, prognostically significant ERS-related genes were found. An ERS-related risk score (ERscore) was created using multivariable Cox analysis. In addition, the biological functions, genetic mutations and immune landscape related to ERscore are also studied to reveal the underlying mechanisms related to ERS in PRAD. We further explored the ERscore-related mechanisms by profiling a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset (GSE137829) and explored the oncogenic role of ASNS in PRAD through in vitro experiments. The risk signature composed of eight ERS-related genes constructed in this study is an independent prognostic factor and validated in the MSKCC and GSE70769 data sets. The scRNA-seq data additionally revealed that several carcinogenic pathways were noticeably overactivated in the group with high ERS scores. As one of the prognostic genes, ASNS will significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of PRAD cells after its expression is interfered with. In conclusion, this study developed a novel risk-specific ERS-based clinical treatment strategy for patients with PRAD."

38204602,Targeted Delivery of Geraniol via Hyaluronic Acid-Conjugation Enhances Its Anti-Tumor Activity Against Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Targeted delivery systems have been developed to improve cancer treatment by reducing side effects and enhancing drug efficacy. Geraniol, a natural product, has demonstrated promising anti-cancer effects in various cancer types, including prostate cancer, which is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural carrier targeting CD44-positive prostate cancer cells, can be utilized in a targeted delivery system. PURPOSE: This study investigated the efficacy of a conjugate of HA and geraniol linked via a disulfide bond linker (HA-SS-Geraniol) in prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxicity of HA-SS-Geraniol was evaluated on human PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Flow cytometry was used to assess its effects on mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, proteomic analysis was conducted to explore the underlying mechanism of action induced by HA-SS-Geraniol treatment. A subcutaneous xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of HA-SS-Geraniol in vivo. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that HA-SS-Geraniol exhibited potent cytotoxicity against PC-3 prostate cancer cells by inducing mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptosis in vitro. The proteomic analysis further supported the hypothesis that HA-SS-Geraniol induces cell death through mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by differential protein expression. The in vivo mouse model confirmed the safety of HA-SS-Geraniol and its ability to inhibit tumor growth. CONCLUSION: HA-SS-Geraniol holds promise as a biologically safe and potentially effective therapeutic agent for prostate cancer treatment. Its targeted delivery system utilizing HA as a carrier shows potential for improving the efficacy of geraniol in cancer therapy."
38201640,Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia with Suppressed Epigenetic Regulator HOXB13 Shows a Lower Incidence of Prostate Cancer Development.,"Our objective was to identify variations in gene expression that could help elucidate the pathways for the development of prostate cancer (PCa) in men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). We included 98 men with BPH, a positive prostate MRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System; PIRADS >/= 4), and a negative biopsy from November 2014 to January 2018. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on tissue cores from the MRI lesion and a geographically distant region (two regions per patient). All patients were followed for at least three years to identify who went on to develop PCa. We compared the gene expressions of those who did not develop PCa (""BPH-only"") vs. those who did (""BPH/PCa""). Then, we identified the subset of men with BPH who had the highest American Urological Association (AUA) symptom scores (""symptomatic BPH"") and compared their gene expression to the BPH/PCa group. At a median follow-up of 47.5 months, 15 men had developed PCa while 83 did not. We compared gene expressions of 14 men with symptomatic BPH (AUAss >/= 18) vs. 15 with BPH/PCa. We found two clusters of genes, suggesting the two groups had distinctive molecular features. Differential analysis revealed genes that were upregulated in BPH-only and downregulated in BPH/PCa, and vice versa. Symptomatic BPH men had upregulation of T-cell activation markers (TCR, CD3, ZAP70, IL-2 and IFN-gamma and chemokine receptors, CXCL9/10) expression. In contrast, men with BPH/PCa had upregulation of NKX3-1 and HOXB13 transcription factors associated with luminal epithelial progenitors but depleted of immune cells, suggesting a cell-autonomous role in immune evasion. Symptomatic BPH with immune-enriched landscapes may support anti-tumor immunity. RNA sequencing of benign prostate biopsy tissue showing upregulation of NKX3-1 and HOXB13 with the absence of T-cells might help in identifying men at higher risk of future PCa development, which may be useful in determining ongoing PCa screening."
38201563,"Genomic Landscape of Endometrial, Ovarian, and Cervical Cancers in Japan from the Database in the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics.","This study aimed to comprehensively clarify the genomic landscape and its association with tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H, >/=10 mut/Mb) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) in endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. We obtained genomic datasets of a comprehensive genomic profiling test, FoundationOne((R)) CDx, with clinical information using the ""Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics"" (C-CAT) database in Japan. Patients can undergo the tests only after standardized treatments under universal health insurance coverage. Endometrial cancers were characterized by a high frequency of TMB-H and MSI-H, especially in endometrioid carcinomas. The lower ratio of POLE exonuclease mutations and the higher ratio of TP53 mutations compared to previous reports suggested the prognostic effects of the molecular subtypes. Among the 839 cervical cancer samples, frequent mutations of KRAS, TP53, PIK3CA, STK11, CDKN2A, and ERBB2 were observed in adenocarcinomas, whereas the ratio of TMB-H was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas. Among the 1606 ovarian cancer samples, genomic profiling of serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous carcinomas was characterized. Pathogenic mutations in the POLE exonuclease domain were associated with high TMB, and the mutation ratio was low in both cervical and ovarian cancers. The C-CAT database is useful for determining the mutational landscape of each cancer type and histological subtype. As the dataset is exclusively collected from patients after the standardized treatments, the information on ""druggable"" alterations highlights the unmet needs for drug development in major gynecological cancers."
38201476,miR-410 Is a Key Regulator of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition with Biphasic Role in Prostate Cancer.,"The molecular basis of prostate cancer (PCa) progression from the primary disease to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) followed by therapy-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer is not fully understood. In this study, we elucidate the role of miR-410, a little-studied microRNA located on chromosome 14q32.31 within the DLK1-DIO3 cluster, in PCa. miR-410 expression analyses in primary and metastatic PCa tissues and cell lines show that its levels are decreased in initial stages and increased in advanced PCa. Functional studies were performed in a series of PCa cell lines. In LNCaP cells, miR-410 overexpression led to decreases in cellular viability, proliferation, invasiveness, and migration. On the other hand, miR-410 overexpression in PC3 and C42B cells led to increased viability, proliferation, and invasiveness. Our data suggest that miR-410 represses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in LNCaP cells by directly repressing SNAIL. However, it promotes EMT and upregulates PI3K/Akt signaling in PC3 and C42B cells. In vivo studies with PC3 xenografts support an oncogenic role of miR-410. These data suggest that miR-410 acts as a tumor suppressor in the initial stages of PCa and play an oncogenic role in advanced PCa. Our findings have important implications in understanding the molecular basis of PCa progression with potential translational implications."
38201475,Cell-Free DNA Genomic Profiling and Its Clinical Implementation in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Most men with prostate cancer (PCa), despite potentially curable localized disease at initial diagnosis, progress to metastatic disease. Despite numerous treatment options, choosing the optimal treatment for individual patients remains challenging. Biomarkers guiding treatment sequences in an advanced setting are lacking. To estimate the diagnostic potential of liquid biopsies in guiding personalized treatment of PCa, we evaluated the utility of a custom-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel based on the AmpliSeq HD Technology. Ultra-deep sequencing on plasma circulating free DNA (cfDNA) samples of 40 metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) and 28 metastatic hormone-naive PCa (mCSPC) was performed. CfDNA somatic mutations were detected in 48/68 (71%) patients. Of those 68 patients, 42 had matched tumor and cfDNA samples. In 21/42 (50%) patients, mutations from the primary tumor tissue were detected in the plasma cfDNA. In 7/42 (17%) patients, mutations found in the primary tumor were not detected in the cfDNA. Mutations from primary tumors were detected in all tested mCRPC patients (17/17), but only in 4/11 with mCSPC. AR amplifications were detected in 12/39 (31%) mCRPC patients. These results indicate that our targeted NGS approach has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting clinically relevant mutations in PCa."
38201450,Deciphering Urogenital Cancers through Proteomic Biomarkers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Urogenital cancers, which include prostate, bladder, and kidney malignancies, exert a substantial impact on global cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Proteomic biomarkers, emerging as valuable tools, aim to enhance early detection, prognostic accuracy, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. This study undertook a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature investigating the role and potential of proteomic biomarkers in plasma, tissue, and urine samples in urogenital cancers. Our extensive search across several databases identified 1879 differentially expressed proteins from 37 studies, signifying their potential as unique biomarkers for these cancers. A meta-analysis of the significantly differentially expressed proteins was executed, accentuating the findings through visually intuitive volcano plots. A functional enrichment analysis unveiled their significant involvement in diverse biological processes, including signal transduction, immune response, cell communication, and cell growth. A pathway analysis highlighted the participation of key pathways such as the nectin adhesion pathway, TRAIL signaling pathway, and integrin signaling pathways. These findings not only pave the way for future investigations into early detection and targeted therapeutic approaches but also underscore the fundamental role of proteomics in advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning urogenital cancer pathogenesis. Ultimately, these findings hold remarkable potential to significantly enhance patient care and improve clinical outcomes."
38200479,Identification of a new gene signature for prognostic evaluation in cervical cancer: based on cuproptosis-associated angiogenesis and multi-omics analysis.,"Patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer are in urgent need of novel prognosis assessment or treatment approaches. In this study, a novel prognostic gene signature was discovered by utilizing cuproptosis-related angiogenesis (CuRA) gene scores obtained through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. To enhance its reliability, the gene signature was refined by integrating supplementary clinical variables and subjected to cross-validation. Meanwhile, the activation of the VEGF pathway was inferred from an analysis of cell-to-cell communication, based on the expression of ligands and receptors in cell transcriptomic datasets. High-CuRA patients had less infiltration of CD8 + T cells and reduced expression of most of immune checkpoint genes, which indicated greater difficulty in immunotherapy. Lower IC50 values of imatinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib in the high-CuRA group revealed the potential value of these drugs. Finally, we verified an independent prognostic gene SFT2D1 was highly expressed in cervical cancer and positively correlated with the microvascular density. Knockdown of SFT2D1 significantly inhibited ability of the proliferation, migration, and invasive in cervical cancer cells. CuRA gene signature provided valuable insights into the prediction of prognosis and immune microenvironment of cervical cancer, which could help develop new strategies for individualized precision therapy for cervical cancer patients."
