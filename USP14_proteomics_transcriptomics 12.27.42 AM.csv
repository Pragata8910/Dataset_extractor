39990235,"USP14 modulates stem-like properties, tumorigenicity, and radiotherapy resistance in glioblastoma stem cells through stabilization of MST4-phosphorylated ALKBH5.","Rationale: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary brain cancer and contains self-renewing GBM stem cells (GSCs) that contribute to tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. However, molecular determinants governing therapeutic resistance of GSCs are poorly understood. Methods: We performed genome-wide analysis of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) in patient-derived GSCs and used gene-specific shRNAs to identify an important DUB gene contributing to GSC survival and radioresistance. Subsequently, we employed mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation to show the interaction between USP14 and ALKBH5, and identified the upstream kinase MST4, which is essential for the deubiquitylation and stabilization of ALKBH5. Additionally, we performed integrated transcriptome and m(6)A-seq analyses to uncover the key downstream pathways of ALKBH5 that influence GSC radioresistance. Results: Our study demonstrates the essential role of the deubiquitinase USP14 in maintaining the stemness, tumorigenic potential, and radioresistance of GSCs. USP14 stabilizes the m(6)A demethylase ALKBH5 by preventing its K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation through HECW2. The phosphorylation of ALKBH5 at serine 64 and 69 by MST4 increases its interaction with USP14, promoting ALKBH5 deubiquitylation. Furthermore, ALKBH5 directly interacts with the USP14 transcript in a manner dependent on YTHDF2, establishing a positive feedback loop that sustains the overexpression of both proteins in GSCs. The MST4-USP14-ALKBH5 signaling pathway is crucial for enhancing stem cell-like traits, facilitating homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and promoting radioresistance and tumorigenicity in GSCs. This signaling cascade is further stimulated in GSCs following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Inhibiting USP14 with the small molecule IU1 disrupts ALKBH5 deubiquitylation and increases the effectiveness of IR therapy on GSC-derived brain tumor xenografts. Conclusion: Our results identify the MST4-USP14-ALKBH5 signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for treating GBM.",Theranostics,2025,thnov15p2293 [pii],
39486496,USP14 inhibition enhances Parkin-independent mitophagy in iNeurons.,"Loss of proteostasis is well documented during physiological aging and depends on the progressive decline in the activity of two major degradative mechanisms: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This decline in proteostasis is exacerbated in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In PD, patients develop an accumulation of aggregated proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria, which leads to ROS production, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We recently reported that inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, which is known to enhance both the UPS and autophagy, increases lifespan and rescues the pathological phenotype of two Drosophila models of PD. Studies on the effects of USP14 inhibition in mammalian neurons have not yet been conducted. To close this gap, we exploited iNeurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and investigated the effect of inhibiting USP14 in these cultured neurons. Quantitative global proteomics analysis performed following genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP14 demonstrated that USP14 loss of function specifically promotes mitochondrial autophagy in iNeurons. Biochemical and imaging data also showed that USP14 inhibition enhances mitophagy. The mitophagic effect of USP14 inhibition proved to be PINK1/Parkin- independent, instead relying on expression of the mitochondrial E3 Ubiquitin Ligase MITOL/MARCH5. Notably, USP14 inhibition normalized the mitochondrial defects of Parkin KO human neurons.",Pharmacological research,2024 Dec,S1043-6618(24)00429-8 [pii],
38844605,Loss of the proteasomal deubiquitinase USP14 induces growth defects and a senescence phenotype in colorectal cancer cells.,"The proteasome-associated deubiquitinase USP14 is a potential drug target. Using an inducible USP14 knockout system in colon cancer cells, we found that USP14 depletion impedes cellular proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and leads to a senescence-like phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered gene expression related to cell division and cellular differentiation. USP14 knockout cells also exhibited changes in morphology, actin distribution, and expression of actin cytoskeletal components. Increased ubiquitin turnover was observed, offset by upregulation of polyubiquitin genes UBB and UBC. Pharmacological inhibition of USP14 with IU1 increased ubiquitin turnover but did not affect cellular growth or morphology. BioGRID data identified USP14 interactors linked to actin cytoskeleton remodeling, DNA damage repair, mRNA splicing, and translation. In conclusion, USP14 loss in colon cancer cells induces a transient quiescent cancer phenotype not replicated by pharmacologic inhibition of its deubiquitinating activity.",Scientific reports,2024 Jun 6,10.1038/s41598-024-63791-5 [pii],
38636737,USP14 negatively regulates IFN signaling by dampening K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 in black carp.,"USP14 regulates the immune related pathways by deubiquitinating the signaling molecules in mammals. In teleost, USP14 is also reported to inhibit the antiviral immune response through TBK1, but its regulatory mechanism remains obscure. To elucidate the role of USP14 in the RLR/IFN antiviral pathway in teleost, the homolog USP14 (bcUSP14) of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) has been cloned and characterize in this paper. bcUSP14 contains 490 amino acids (aa), and the sequence is well conserved among in vertebrates. Over-expression of bcUSP14 in EPC cells attenuated SVCV-induced transcription activity of IFN promoters and enhanced SVCV replication. Knockdown of bcUSP14 in MPK cells led to the increased transcription of IFNs and decreased SVCV replication, suggesting the improved antiviral activity of the host cells. The interaction between bcUSP14 and bcTBK1 was identified by both co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Co-expressed bcUSP14 obviously inhibited bcTBK1-induced IFN production and antiviral activity in EPC cells. K63-linked polyubiquitination of bcTBK1 was dampened by co-expressed bcUSP14, and bcTBK1-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were also inhibited by this deubiquitinase. Thus, all the data demonstrated that USP14 interacts with and inhibits TBK1 through deubiquitinating TBK1 in black carp.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024 Jun,S1050-4648(24)00203-1 [pii],
37229827,USP14 regulates heme metabolism and ovarian cancer invasion through BACH1 deubiquitination and stabilization.,"The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 has been established as a crucial regulator in various diseases, including tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic diseases, through its ability to stabilize its substrate proteins. Our group has utilized proteomic techniques to identify new potential substrate proteins for USP14, however, the underlying signaling pathways regulated by USP14 remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate the key role of USP14 in both heme metabolism and tumor invasion by stabilizing the protein BACH1. The cellular oxidative stress response factor NRF2 regulates antioxidant protein expression through binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). BACH1 can compete with NRF2 for ARE binding, leading to the inhibition of the expression of antioxidant genes, including HMOX-1. Activated NRF2 also inhibits the degradation of BACH1, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Our findings showed a positive correlation between USP14 expression and NRF2 expression in various cancer tissues from the TCGA database and normal tissues from the GTEx database. Furthermore, activated NRF2 was found to increase USP14 expression in ovarian cancer (OV) cells. The overexpression of USP14 was observed to inhibit HMOX1 expression, while USP14 knockdown had the opposite effect, suggesting a role for USP14 in regulating heme metabolism. The depletion of BACH1 or inhibition of heme oxygenase 1 (coded by HMOX-1) was also found to significantly impair USP14-dependent OV cell invasion. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of the NRF2-USP14-BACH1 axis in regulating OV cell invasion and heme metabolism, providing evidence for its potential as a therapeutic target in related diseases.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2023 Jul 30,S0006-291X(23)00505-3 [pii],
36604147,USP14 regulates cell cycle progression through deubiquitinating CDK1 in breast cancer.,"Abnormal proliferation and cell cycle perturbation are the main hallmarks of breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is one of the key kinases for cell transition from the G2 phase to M phase during the cell cycle progression. However, little is known about the degradation mechanisms of CDK1. USP14 (ubiquitin-specific processing protease 14) is an important proteasome-associated deubiquitinase that is critical for proteome homeostasis and plays a crucial role in the initiation and development of cancer. In this study, we find that USP14 shows high expression in breast cancer cells and results in the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells. Furthermore, we examine cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry and find that inhibition of USP14 causes cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. As CDK1 is the key kinase in G2/M phase, we detect the interaction between USP14 and CDK1 and the effect of USP14 on the deubiquitination of CDK1. The results reveal that USP14 interacts with CDK1 and stabilizes CDK1 by deubiquitinating K48-linked ubiquitination. In conclusion, our findings reveal an indispensable role of USP14 in regulating cell cycle progression by stabilizing CDK1 in breast cancer, suggesting that USP14 may be used as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer therapy.",Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,2022 Nov 25,10.3724/abbs.2022160,
35530310,Comprehensive Target Screening and Cellular Profiling of the Cancer-Active Compound b-AP15 Indicate Abrogation of Protein Homeostasis and Organelle Dysfunction as the Primary Mechanism of Action.,"Dienone compounds have been demonstrated to display tumor-selective anti-cancer activity independently of the mutational status of TP53. Previous studies have shown that cell death elicited by this class of compounds is associated with inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here we extend previous findings by showing that the dienone compound b-AP15 inhibits proteasomal degradation of long-lived proteins. We show that exposure to b-AP15 results in increased association of the chaperones VCP/p97/Cdc48 and BAG6 with proteasomes. Comparisons between the gene expression profile generated by b-AP15 to those elicited by siRNA showed that knock-down of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinase (DUB) USP14 is the closest related to drug response. USP14 is a validated target for b-AP15 and we show that b-AP15 binds covalently to two cysteines, Cys203 and Cys257, in the ubiquitin-binding pocket of the enzyme. Consistent with this, deletion of USP14 resulted in decreased sensitivity to b-AP15. Targeting of USP14 was, however, found to not fully account for the observed proteasome inhibition. In search for additional targets, we utilized genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening and Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) to identify mechanistically essential genes and b-AP15 interacting proteins respectively. Deletion of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins decreased the sensitivity to b-AP15, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is coupled to cell death induced by b-AP15. Enzymes known to be involved in Phase II detoxification such as aldo-ketoreductases and glutathione-S-transferases were identified as b-AP15-targets using PISA. The finding that different exploratory approaches yielded different results may be explained in terms of a ""target"" not necessarily connected to the ""mechanism of action"" thus highlighting the importance of a holistic approach in the identification of drug targets. We conclude that b-AP15, and likely also other dienone compounds of the same class, affect protein degradation and proteasome function at more than one level.",Frontiers in oncology,2022,10.3389/fonc.2022.852980,
35489684,A ubiquitinome analysis to study the functional roles of the proteasome associated deubiquitinating enzymes USP14 and UCH37.,"The removal of (poly)ubiquitin chains at the proteasome is a key step in the protein degradation pathway that determines which proteins are degraded and ultimately decides cell fate. Three different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are associated to the human proteasome, PSMD14 (RPN11), USP14 and UCH37 (UCHL5). However, the functional roles and specificities of these proteasomal DUBs remain elusive. To reveal the specificities of proteasome associated DUBs, we used SILAC based quantitative ubiquitinomics to study the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 based knockout of each of these DUBs on the dynamic cellular ubiquitinome. We observed distinct effects on the global ubiquitinome upon removal of either USP14 or UCH37, while the simultaneous removal of both DUBs suggested less functional redundancy than previously anticipated. We also investigated whether the small molecule inhibitor b-AP15 has the potential to specifically target USP14 and UCH37 by comparing treatment of wild-type versus USP14/UCH37 double-knockout cells with this drug. Strikingly, broad and severe off-target effects were observed, questioning the alleged specificity of this inhibitor. In conclusion, this work presents novel insights into the function of proteasome associated DUBs and illustrates the power of in-depth ubiquitinomics for screening the activity of DUBs and of DUB modulating compounds. SIGNIFICANCE: Introduction: The removal of (poly)ubiquitin chains at the proteasome is a key step in the protein degradation pathway that determines which proteins are degraded and ultimately decides cell fate. Three different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are associated to the human proteasome, PSMD14/RPN11, USP14 and UCH37/UCHL5. However, the functional roles and specificities of these proteasomal DUBs remains elusive. MATERIALS & METHODS: We have applied a SILAC based quantitative ubiquitinomics to study the effects of CRISPR-Cas9 based knockout of each of these DUBs on the dynamic cellular ubiquitinome. Also, we have studied the function of the small molecule inhibitor b-AP15, which has the potential to specifically target USP14 and UCH37. RESULTS: We report distinct effects on the ubiquitinome and the ability of the proteasome to clear proteins upon removal of either USP14 or UCH37, while the simultaneous removal of both DUBs suggests less redundancy than previously anticipated. In addition, broad and severe off-target effects were observed for b-AP15, questioning the alleged specificity of this inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: This work presents novel insights into the function of proteasome associated DUBs and illustrates the power of in-depth ubiquitinomics for screening the activity of DUBs and of DUB modulating compounds.",Journal of proteomics,2022 Jun 30,S1874-3919(22)00116-6 [pii],
33737492,Deubiquitylation and stabilization of Acf7 by ubiquitin carboxylterminal hydrolase 14 (USP14) is critical for NSCLC migration.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is an essential regulator of Acf7, which serves as a key effector for the maintenance of the EMT program and migration. However, the precise mechanism for the deubiquitination of Acf7 is still not fully understood. Using a proteomic approach, we identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14) as an Acf7-associated deubiquitinase. Our findings show that there was an interaction between USP14 and Acf7. The expression of USP14 and Acf7 were elevated in lung cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal cells. Employing the overexpression of USP14 and the USP14 knockdown assay indicated that USP14 can greatly increase the steady-state levels of Acf7 by inhibiting the degradation of Acf7 through the ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Here we identified USP14 as a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulated Acf7 ubiquitination and protein levels. Moreover, knockdown of USP14 inhibited cell migration, however, overexpression of wild-type USP14 but not USP14 mutants promoted cell migration. Together, these results suggest that USP14 plays an important role in the NSCLC migration through modulating Acf7 stability.",Journal of biosciences,2021,19 [pii],
32697961,Grouper ubiquitin-specific protease 14 promotes iridovirus replication through negatively regulating interferon response.,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), one of the USP family members which belong to deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays a key role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by trimming ubiquitin chains from their substrates. However, the roles of USP14 in response to virus infection still remains largely unknown. In the current study, a USP14 homolog from orange spotted grouper (EcUSP14) was cloned and its roles in innate immune response were investigated. EcUSP14 was composed of 1479 base pairs encoding a 492-amino acid (aa) polypeptide. Sequence analysis indicated that EcUSP14 shared 96.14% and 81.30% identity to USP14 of bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) and humans (homo sapiens), respectively. EcUSP14 contains conserved ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain (aa 3-76) and peptidase-C19A domain (aa 106-481). In response to Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) infection in vitro, EcUSP14 was significantly up-regulated. Subcellular localization showed that EcUSP14 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of grouper spleen (GS) cells and mostly co-localized with the viral assembly sites after SGIV infection. The ectopic expression of EcUSP14 significantly promoted the replication of SGIV, as demonstrated by the accelerated progression of severity of cytopathic e ff ect (CPE), the increased viral gene transcription and viral protein synthesis during infection. Consistently, treatment with IU1, a USP14 specific inhibitor, significantly inhibited the replication of SGIV, suggesting that USP14 function as a pro-viral factor during SGIV replication. Further analysis showed that EcUSP14 overexpression decreased the promoter activities of interferon (IFN)-1, IFN-3, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), and nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-kappaB). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcUSP14 decreased the activities of IFN-1 promoter evoked by TANK-binding kinase (TBK)-1 and melanoma di ff erentiation-associated protein (MDA)-5, but not stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Thus, we speculated that EcUSP14 facilitated virus replication by negatively regulating the IFN response. Taken together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish USP14 functioned as a pro-viral factor by negatively regulating interferon response against virus infection.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2020 Oct,S1050-4648(20)30499-X [pii],
32109059,"Re-Evaluating the Mechanism of Action of alpha,beta-Unsaturated Carbonyl DUB Inhibitors b-AP15 and VLX1570: A Paradigmatic Example of Unspecific Protein Cross-linking with Michael Acceptor Motif-Containing Drugs.","Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a growing target class across multiple disease states, with several inhibitors now reported. b-AP15 and VLX1570 are two structurally related USP14/UCH-37 inhibitors. Through a proteomic approach, we demonstrate that these compounds target a diverse range of proteins, resulting in the formation of higher molecular weight (MW) complexes. Activity-based proteome profiling identified CIAPIN1 as a submicromolar covalent target of VLX1570, and further analysis demonstrated that high MW complex formation leads to aggregation of CIAPIN1 in intact cells. Our results suggest that in addition to DUB inhibition, these compounds induce nonspecific protein aggregation, providing molecular explanation for general cellular toxicity.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2020 Apr 9,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00144,
31901637,"Dynamic Interaction of USP14 with the Chaperone HSC70 Mediates Crosstalk between the Proteasome, ER Signaling, and Autophagy.","USP14 is a deubiquitinating enzyme associated with the proteasome important for protein degradation. Here we show that upon proteasome inhibition or expression of the mutant W58A-USP14, association of USP14 with the 19S regulatory particle is disrupted. MS-based interactomics revealed an interaction of USP14 with the chaperone, HSC70, in neuroblastoma cells. Proteasome inhibition enhanced binding of USP14 to HSC70, and to XBP1u and IRE1alpha proteins, demonstrating a role in the unfolded protein response. Striatal neurons expressing mutant huntingtin exhibited reduced USP14 and HSC70 levels, whereas inhibition of HSC70 downregulated USP14. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition or use of the mutant W58A-USP14 facilitated the interaction of USP14 with the autophagy protein, GABARAP. Functionally, overexpression of W58A-USP14 increased GABARAP positive autophagosomes in striatal neurons, and this was abrogated using the HSC70 inhibitor, VER-155008. Modulation of the USP14-HSC70 axis may represent a potential therapeutic target in HD to beneficially influence multiple proteostasis pathways.",iScience,2020 Jan 24,S2589-0042(19)30535-8 [pii],
31740976,USP14 is a deubiquitinase for Ku70 and critical determinant of non-homologous end joining repair in autophagy and PTEN-deficient cells.,"Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). IR-induced DNA damage activates autophagy, an intracellular degradation process that delivers cytoplasmic components to the lysosome. We identified the deubiquitinase USP14 as a novel autophagy substrate and a regulator of IR-induced DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. Inhibition of autophagy increased levels and DSB recruitment of USP14. USP14 antagonized RNF168-dependent ubiquitin signaling and downstream 53BP1 chromatin recruitment. Here we show that autophagy-deficient cells are defective in NHEJ, as indicated by decreased IR-induced foci (IRIF) formation by pS2056-, pT2609-DNA-PKcs, pS1778-53BP1, RIF1 and a reporter assay activation. Moreover, chromatin recruitment of key NHEJ proteins, including, Ku70, Ku80, DNA-PKcs and XLF was diminished in autophagy-deficient cells. USP14 inhibition rescued the activity of NHEJ-DDR proteins in autophagy-deficient cells. Mass spectrometric analysis identified USP14 interaction with core NHEJ proteins, including Ku70, which was validated by co-immunoprecipitation. An in vitro assay revealed that USP14 targeted Ku70 for deubiquitination. AKT, which mediates Ser432-USP14 phosphorylation, was required for IRIF formation by USP14. Similar to USP14 block, AKT inhibition rescued the activity of NHEJ-DDR proteins in autophagy- and PTEN-deficient cells. These findings reveal a novel negative PTEN/Akt-dependent regulation of NHEJ by USP14.",Nucleic acids research,2020 Jan 24,5628926 [pii],
30946948,Repurposing of auranofin: Thioredoxin reductase remains a primary target of the drug.,"Auranofin is a gold (I)-containing compound used for the treatment of rheumatic arthritis. Auranofin has anticancer activity in animal models and is approved for clinical trials for lung and ovarian carcinomas. Both the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are well documented targets of auranofin. Auranofin was recently reported to also inhibit proteasome activity at the level of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) UCHL5 and USP14. We here set out to re-examine the molecular mechanism underlying auranofin cytotoxicity towards cultured cancer cells. The effects of auranofin on the proteasome were examined in cells and in vitro, effects on DUB activity were assessed using different substrates. The cellular response to auranofin was compared to that of the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the 19S DUB inhibitor b-AP15 using proteomics. Auranofin was found to inhibit mitochondrial activity and to an induce oxidative stress response at IC(50) doses. At 2-3-fold higher doses, auranofin inhibits proteasome processing in cells. At such supra-pharmacological concentrations USP14 activity was inhibited. Analysis of protein expression profiles in drug-exposed tumor cells showed that auranofin induces a response distinct from that of the 20S proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the DUB inhibitor b-AP15, both of which induced similar responses. Our results support the notion that the primary mechanism of action of auranofin is TrxR inhibition and suggest that proteasome DUB inhibition is an off-target effect. Whether proteasome inhibition will contribute to the antineoplastic effect of auranofin in treated patients is unclear but remains a possibility.",Biochimie,2019 Jul,S0300-9084(19)30084-7 [pii],
30425250,Proteome-wide analysis of USP14 substrates revealed its role in hepatosteatosis via stabilization of FASN.,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) is one of the major proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes critical for proteome homeostasis. However, substrates of USP14 remain largely unknown, hindering the understanding of its functional roles. Here we conduct a comprehensive proteome, ubiquitinome and interactome analysis for USP14 substrate screening. Bioinformatics analysis reveals broad new potential roles of USP14, especially in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Among the potential substrates identified, we show that fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme involved in hepatic lipogenesis, is a bona fide substrate of USP14. USP14 directly interacts with and increases FASN stability. As a result, overexpression of USP14 promotes liver triglyceride accumulation in C57BL/6 mice, whereas genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP14 ameliorates hepatosteatosis, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in obese mice. In conclusion, our findings reveal for the first time an indispensable role of USP14 in hepatosteatosis through FASN stabilization.",Nature communications,2018 Nov 13,10.1038/s41467-018-07185-y [pii],
30389639,Depletion of endogenous miRNA-378-3p increases peak cell density of CHO DP12 cells and is correlated with elevated levels of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14.,"miRNAs are potent molecular regulators of cellular behaviour. The manipulation of these small non-coding RNAs has been used to enhance industrially relevant phenotypes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. We investigated the stable depletion of six miRNAs; miR-204-5p, 338-3p, 378-3p, 409-3p, 455-3p and 505-3p, robustly associated with cell growth rate from a previous profiling study. Inhibition of endogenous miR-378-3p function by miRNA-sponge-decoy improved peak cell density by 59%. Quantitative label free LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of the fractionated cell cultures at day 4 and 8 of batch culture found 216 cytosolic and 114 membrane-associated proteins differentially expressed with stable miR-378-3p depletion. qRT-PCR of 8 genes; Clic4, Hnrnpa1, Prdx1, Actn4, Usp14, Srxn1, Canx and Gnb1, with unidirectional differential protein expression over the two time points of analysis was carried out. In-silico predictive algorithms; TargetScan and miRDB, were used to decipher possible direct targets of miR-378-3p. The Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 14 (Usp14) protein was identified in the cytosolic fractions at both timepoints as differentially expressed with an increased abundance of 1.58-fold in the miR-378-3p depleted cells on day 8. Usp14 is a deubiquitinase (DUB) with previous reports of its up-regulation leading to increased proliferation of cancer cells. Overexpression of Usp14 in CHO cells had significant effects on cell growth supporting a role for Usp14 in the increased peak cell density seen with miR-378-3p depletion. This study highlights miR-378-3p as a novel engineering candidate for improving CHO cell growth. The use of subcellular fractionation also improved proteome coverage in the identification of novel miRNA targets.",Journal of biotechnology,2018 Dec 20,S0168-1656(18)30672-2 [pii],
29995557,USP14 regulates DNA damage repair by targeting RNF168-dependent ubiquitination.,"Recent reports have made important revelations, uncovering direct regulation of DNA damage response (DDR)-associated proteins and chromatin ubiquitination (Ubn) by macroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we report a previously unexplored connection between autophagy and DDR, via a deubiquitnase (DUB), USP14. Loss of autophagy in prostate cancer cells led to unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as indicated by persistent ionizing radiation (IR)-induced foci (IRIF) formation for gammaH2AFX, and decreased protein levels and IRIF formation for RNF168, an E3-ubiquitin ligase essential for chromatin Ubn and recruitment of critical DDR effector proteins in response to DSBs, including TP53BP1. Consistently, RNF168-associated Ubn signaling and TP53BP1 IRIF formation were reduced in autophagy-deficient cells. An activity assay identified several DUBs, including USP14, which showed higher activity in autophagy-deficient cells. Importantly, inhibiting USP14 could overcome DDR defects in autophagy-deficient cells. USP14 IRIF formation and protein stability were increased in autophagy-deficient cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of USP14 with MAP1LC3B and the UBA-domain of SQSTM1 identified USP14 as a substrate of autophagy and SQSTM1. Additionally, USP14 directly interacted with RNF168, which depended on the MIU1 domain of RNF168. These findings identify USP14 as a novel substrate of autophagy and regulation of RNF168-dependent Ubn and TP53BP1 recruitment by USP14 as a critical link between DDR and autophagy. Given the role of Ubn signaling in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), the major pathway for repair of IR-induced DNA damage, these findings provide unique insights into the link between autophagy, DDR-associated Ubn signaling and NHEJ DNA repair.

29777785,PSMD2 regulates breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by modulating p21 and p27 proteasomal degradation.,"Alterations in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and UPS-associated proteins have been implicated in the development of many human malignancies. In this study, we investigated the expression profiles of 797 UPS-related genes using HiSeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified that PSMD2 was markedly upregulated in breast cancer. High PSMD2 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that transcriptome signatures involving proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were critically enriched in specimens with elevated PSMD2. Consistently, PSMD2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in vitro, as well as suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Rescue assays demonstrated that the cell cycle arrest caused by silencing PSMD2 partially resulted from increased p21 and/or p27. Mechanically, PSMD2 physically interacted with p21 and p27 and mediated their ubiquitin-proteasome degradation with the cooperation of USP14.

29732405,Broad and diverse mechanisms used by deubiquitinase family members in regulating the type I interferon signaling pathway during antiviral responses.,"The innate immune response conferred by type I interferons is essential for host defense against viral infection but needs to be tightly controlled to avoid immunopathology. We performed a systematic functional screening by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) knockout and overexpression to investigate the roles of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family in regulating antiviral immunity. We demonstrated that the expression of a large fraction of DUBs underwent complex temporal alteration, suggesting a dynamic program of feedback regulation. Moreover, we identified previously unrecognized roles of a subset of DUBs, including USP5, USP14, USP22, USP48, USP52, COPS5, and BRCC3, in inhibiting antiviral immunity at various levels. We explored an unexpected mechanism where multiple DUBs, such as USP5 and USP22, form diverse signalosomes with E3 ligases or DUBs to alter the substrates' ubiquitination state instead of directly cleaving the ubiquitin chains on substrates via their protease activity. Altogether, our study has revealed a panoramic view of the broad and dynamic involvement of DUB family proteins in regulating antiviral responses.",Science advances,2018 May,aar2824 [pii],
27542828,USP14 regulates autophagy by suppressing K63 ubiquitination of Beclin 1.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are two major intracellular degradative mechanisms that mediate the turnover of complementary repertoires of intracellular proteomes. Simultaneously activating both UPS and autophagy might provide a powerful strategy for the clearance of misfolded proteins. However, it is not clear whether UPS and autophagy can be controlled by a common regulatory mechanism. K48 deubiquitination by USP14 is known to inhibit UPS. Here we show that USP14 regulates autophagy by negatively controlling K63 ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Furthermore, we show that activation of USP14 by Akt-mediated phosphorylation provides a mechanism for Akt to negatively regulate autophagy by promoting K63 deubiquitination. Our study suggests that Akt-regulated USP14 activity modulates both proteasomal degradation and autophagy through controlling K48 and K63 ubiquitination, respectively. Therefore, regulation of USP14 provides a mechanism for Akt to control both proteasomal and autophagic degradation. We propose that inhibition of USP14 may provide a strategy to promote both UPS and autophagy for developing novel therapeutics targeting neurodegenerative diseases.",Genes & development,2016 Aug 1,30/15/1718 [pii],
26471267,"Deubiquitinases Modulate Platelet Proteome Ubiquitination, Aggregation, and Thrombosis.","OBJECTIVE: Platelets express a functional ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mass spectrometry shows that platelets contain several deubiquitinases, but whether these are functional, modulate the proteome, or affect platelet reactivity are unknown. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Platelet lysates contained ubiquitin-protein deubiquitinase activity hydrolyzing both Lys48 and Lys63 polyubiquitin conjugates that was suppressed by the chemically unrelated deubiquitinase inhibitors PYR41 and PR619. These inhibitors acutely and markedly increased monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of the proteome of resting platelets. PYR41 (intravenous, 15 minutes) significantly impaired occlusive thrombosis in FeCl3-damaged carotid arteries, and deubiquitinase inhibition reduced platelet adhesion and retention during high shear flow of whole blood through microfluidic chambers coated with collagen. Total internal reflection microscopy showed that adhesion and spreading in the absence of flow were strongly curtailed by these inhibitors with failure of stable process extension and reduced the retraction of formed clots. Deubiquitinase inhibition also sharply reduced homotypic platelet aggregation in response to not only the incomplete agonists ADP and collagen acting through glycoprotein VI but also to the complete agonist thrombin. Suppressed aggregation was accompanied by curtailed procaspase activating compound-1 binding to activated IIb/IIIa and inhibition of P-selectin translocation to the platelet surface. Deubiquitinase inhibition abolished the agonist-induced spike in intracellular calcium, suppressed Akt phosphorylation, and reduced agonist-stimulated phosphatase and tensin homolog phosphatase phosphorylation. Platelets express the proteasome-associated deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5, and selective inhibition of these enzymes by b-AP15 reproduced the inhibitory effect of the general deubiquitinase inhibitors on ex vivo platelet function. CONCLUSIONS: Remodeling of the ubiquitinated platelet proteome by deubiquitinases promotes agonist-stimulated intracellular signal transduction and platelet responsiveness.","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2015 Dec,ATVBAHA.115.306054 [pii],
25691154,"Targeted inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzymes, USP14 and UCHL5, induces proteotoxic stress and apoptosis in Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia tumour cells.","Deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) of the proteasomal 19S regulatory particle are emerging as important therapeutic targets in several malignancies. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of two proteasome-associated DUBs (USP14 and UCHL5) with the small molecule DUB inhibitor b-AP15, results in apoptosis of human Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia (WM) cell lines and primary patient-derived WM tumour cells. Importantly, b-AP15 produced proteotoxic stress and apoptosis in WM cells that have acquired resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In silico modelling identified protein residues that were critical for the binding of b-AP15 with USP14 or UCHL5 and proteasome enzyme activity assays confirmed that b-AP15 does not affect the proteolytic capabilities of the 20S proteasome beta-subunits. In vitro toxicity from b-AP15 appeared to result from a build-up of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in WM cells, an effect that also disrupted the mitochondria. Focused transcriptome profiling of b-AP15-treated WM cells revealed modulation of several genes regulating cell stress and NF-kappaB signalling, the latter whose protein translocation and downstream target activation was reduced by b-AP15 in vitro. This is the first report to define the effects and underlying mechanisms associated with inhibition of USP14 and UCHL5 DUB activity in WM tumour cells.",British journal of haematology,2015 May,10.1111/bjh.13304,
24472655,NitroDIGE analysis reveals inhibition of protein S-nitrosylation by epigallocatechin gallates in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule regulating numerous cellular functions in development and disease. In the brain, neuronal injury or neuroinflammation can lead to microglial activation, which induces NO production. NO can react with critical cysteine thiols of target proteins forming S-nitroso-proteins. This modification, known as S-nitrosylation, is an evolutionarily conserved redox-based post-translational modification (PTM) of specific proteins analogous to phosphorylation. In this study, we describe a protocol for analyzing S-nitrosylation of proteins using a gel-based proteomic approach and use it to investigate the modes of action of a botanical compound found in green tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on protein S-nitrosylation after microglial activation. METHODS/RESULTS: To globally and quantitatively analyze NO-induced protein S-nitrosylation, the sensitive gel-based proteomic method, termed NitroDIGE, was developed by combining two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) with the modified biotin switch technique (BST) using fluorescence-tagged CyDye thiol reactive agents to label S-nitrosothiols. The NitroDIGE method showed high specificity and sensitivity in detecting S-nitrosylated proteins (SNO-proteins). Using this approach, we identified a subset of SNO-proteins ex vivo by exposing immortalized murine BV-2 microglial cells to a physiological NO donor, or in vivo by exposing BV-2 cells to endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce a proinflammatory response. Moreover, EGCG was shown to attenuate S-nitrosylation of proteins after LPS-induced activation of microglial cells primarily by modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated oxidative stress response. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that NitroDIGE is an effective proteomic strategy for ""top-down"" quantitative analysis of protein S-nitrosylation in multi-group samples in response to nitrosative stress due to excessive generation of NO in cells. Using this approach, we have revealed the ability of EGCG to down-regulate protein S-nitrosylation in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, consistent with its known antioxidant effects.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2014 Jan 28,1742-2094-11-17 [pii],
24011031,Induction of tumor cell apoptosis by a proteasome deubiquitinase inhibitor is associated with oxidative stress.,"AIMS: b-AP15 is a recently described inhibitor of the USP14/UCHL5 deubiquitinases (DUBs) of the 19S proteasome. Exposure to b-AP15 results in blocking of proteasome function and accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein substrates in cells. This novel mechanism of proteasome inhibition may potentially be exploited for cancer therapy, in particular for treatment of malignancies resistant to currently used proteasome inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to characterize the cellular response to b-AP15-mediated proteasome DUB inhibition. RESULTS: We report that b-AP15 elicits a similar, but yet distinct, cellular response as the clinically used proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. b-AP15 induces a rapid apoptotic response, associated with enhanced induction of oxidative stress and rapid activation of Jun-N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK)/activating protein-1 signaling. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species and pharmacological inhibition of JNK reduced b-AP15-induced apoptosis. We further report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced by b-AP15 and is involved in apoptosis induction. In contrast to bortezomib, ER stress is associated with induction of alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation. INNOVATION: The findings establish that different modes of proteasome inhibition result in distinct cellular responses, a finding of potential therapeutic importance. CONCLUSION: Our data show that enhanced oxidative stress and ER stress are major determinants of the strong apoptotic response elicited by the 19S DUB inhibitor b-AP15.",Antioxidants & redox signaling,2014 Dec 10,10.1089/ars.2013.5322 [pii],
22792064,Antiviral activity of a small molecule deubiquitinase inhibitor occurs via induction of the unfolded protein response.,"Ubiquitin (Ub) is a vital regulatory component in various cellular processes, including cellular responses to viral infection. As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses have the capacity to manipulate the ubiquitin (Ub) cycle to their advantage by encoding Ub-modifying proteins including deubiquitinases (DUBs). However, how cellular DUBs modulate specific viral infections, such as norovirus, is poorly understood. To examine the role of DUBs during norovirus infection, we used WP1130, a small molecule inhibitor of a subset of cellular DUBs. Replication of murine norovirus in murine macrophages and the human norovirus Norwalk virus in a replicon system were significantly inhibited by WP1130. Chemical proteomics identified the cellular DUB USP14 as a target of WP1130 in murine macrophages, and pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP14 inhibited murine norovirus infection. USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB that also binds to inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a critical mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR). WP1130 treatment of murine macrophages did not alter proteasome activity but activated the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) through an IRE1-dependent mechanism. In addition, WP1130 treatment or induction of the UPR also reduced infection of other RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, Sindbis virus, and La Crosse virus but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1 endonuclease activity partially rescued the antiviral effect of WP1130. Taken together, our studies support a model whereby induction of the UPR through cellular DUB inhibition blocks specific viral infections, and suggest that cellular DUBs and the UPR represent novel targets for future development of broad spectrum antiviral therapies.",PLoS pathogens,2012,PPATHOGENS-D-11-02480 [pii],
20823120,Trimming of ubiquitin chains by proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes.,"The proteasome generally recognizes substrate via its multiubiquitin chain followed by ATP-dependent unfolding and translocation of the substrate from the regulatory particle into the proteolytic core particle to be degraded. Substrate-bound ubiquitin groups are for the most part not delivered to the core particle and broken down together with substrate but instead recovered as intact free ubiquitin and ubiquitin chains. Substrate deubiquitination on the proteasome is mediated by three distinct deubiquitinating enzymes associated with the regulatory particle: RPN11, UCH37, and USP14. RPN11 cleaves at the base of the ubiquitin chain where it is linked to the substrate, whereas UCH37 and apparently USP14 mediate a stepwise removal of ubiquitin from the substrate by disassembling the chain from its distal tip. In contrast to UCH37 and USP14, RPN11 shows degradation-coupled activity; RPN11-mediated deubiquitination is apparently delayed until the proteasome is committed to degrade the substrate. Accordingly, RPN11-mediated deubiquitination promotes substrate degradation. In contrast, removal of ubiquitin prior to commitment could antagonize substrate degradation by promoting substrate dissociation from the proteasome. Emerging evidence suggests that USP14 and UCH37 can both suppress substrate degradation in this way. One line of study has shown that small molecule USP14 inhibitors can enhance proteasome function in cells, which is consistent with this model. Enhancing protein degradation could potentially have therapeutic applications for diseases involving toxic proteins that are proteasome substrates. However, the responsiveness of substrates to inhibition of proteasomal deubiquitinating enzymes may vary substantially. This substrate specificity and its mechanistic basis should be addressed in future studies.",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2011 May,S1535-9476(20)30234-6 [pii],
